Hey! Will you release a list of what foodstalls will be at the festival this year?,0
Yup  coming up soon in the app,0
Will the festival be accepting American Express Credit Cards?  Thanks.  Dave Camp Wolfpack,0
Indeed we will.,0
What b******s Eavis you are profit making  the largest festival with lots of income streams  ticket prices are high you sell out with a capacity of 203k per day compared to Roskilde Festival second largest festival in Europe £110k per day for (4 main days & 3 warm up days(for those there for the full week))7 days.... which has been truly none profit since 1972..Any low fees(if they are as low as reported)go to line your pocket.... rather than helping others? Are these artists & the general public not aware of where the £ goes?  Like a lot of things (the UK's Education Health Service Welfare State etc)the Danes took the original Glastonbury concept kept it as it should be or even bettered it for the good of all to fund good courses all over the world & also is very transparent in everything it does?  Hence why I'm off to #rf17 next week rather than Glastonbury (& it's not just because of their unfare distribution of tickets all sold before any of the line up is know) This is our 4th year in a row.....because the experience is far better now on so many grounds compared to the festival that inspired it origionaly.  Michael you could learn so much from them in so many areas? For example we'll be safely down the front for the Foos and will not have to be stood by the main stage all day only to get crushed when they come on  because of the traffic light system (front pits that are emptied of people & of all rubbish between all acts etc) we'll just queue at the longest while watching the previous act. so we can enter a safe environment to watch & enjoy.  This also is done in the large tented arena. So even for the small bands earlier in the day you are down the front with like minded people rather than those who there waiting for the headline act. When will we see this system introduced in the UK?  Bands also play full sets rather than cut down festival versions. Quality rather than quantity.... also timings and stage posistioning make it easier to move around the festival without missing your favourite acts... & that is just one reason of many that makes the trip so worthwhile...   @orangefeeling #rf17,1
Thanks for the kind words (about us  anyways)!,0
Thank you not long now less than a week before we leave for Roskilde..... we love it hoping things go a bit smother this year!!!   As last year our car was broken unintentionaly by stewards when they moved it :-) At the time we were promised that we would be reimbursed. However  it was handed to your insurance company when we got back to England who have denied liability. My insurance company have tried to sort after I gave up  but they have got nowhere either with your insurers :-(   So we must love it after that to come back to #rf17,0
 My first Roskilde experience was when I had just turned sweet sixteen. I was amazed that this free world even existed. You forget about the real world outside of the festival and I felt that there were no limits to what could happen. I thought I met my first love but as soon as Roskilde ended it was all just a happy memory. Some things should just be in the moment! Now I'm on my 3rd year and the happy world still exists within the festival walls . Anna 19  HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants #RF15,14
Q: for RF or anyone that knows. If I get a single-day ticket am I allowed to stay in the camping area that very night (and only that night) after the music?,0
Yes you are - you Can stay untill the next morning,0
F for fantastic.  The new camping area F is ready for you. What used to be a huge gravel pit will become the home of thousands of happy festival-goers at Roskilde Festival 2017. See you soon.,20
Katrine Halbye this one u talked about=,0
Frederik Tømmerby Laursen Sebastian Kandborg but how,0
Are you planning to sell more tickets this year to fill the F area  or can we expect less crowded camping areas since some festival-goers will be moving to F?,0
No more walking in the desert! ??,0
https://youtu.be/Of-lpfsBR8U,0
Rickard Svenningsson this is honestly kinda tempting. Whatchu think?,0
That redness in the middle.,0
Most def! Haven't located it on the map yet do you know where it is?,0
it's the gravel pit  the field we'd have to cross to get to the countdown stage ??,0
It's the same amount of tickets as always. We sell 80 000 Full Festival Tickets and 5 000 one-day tickets for each day.,0
Hi! On the map  wich M's are tenthouses?,0

The map is ready!  Find out where to camp  hear music  get beer - and generally have the best time of your life. Notice the reclaimed camping area F!  Download pdf: http://roskil.de/rf17map  PS: Entrance South is Gate 52 on this map.,243
Kristina Chaithon PedersenSofie Braum HolstVictoria Just Stewart ka i se syd indgangen?,0
I can't see anything that should identify where I can  get beer  as you write? which pictogram should I look for?,0
Where is the South entrance?,0
where is Entrance South on the map?,0
When buying  Get A Place  the following is stated on your website:   There will be a designated waiting area for festival-goers who've bought Special Camping products and need to use Entrance South   Could you please locate that on the map for me? Roskilde Festival,0
Adrian Mooney the caption says you'll have the best time of your life.... why would it lie?!?!,0
When you look at H (Dream City) the construction areas haven't been given a number. It's quite unfortunate  since you can't see  where to go  if you are attending events in Dream City  that's being held in those areas.,0

Sharing the festival with not just the ones i love  but with everybody. It's about that feeling of being one together with 100.000 others no matter if the are voulenteers  stagecrew  bands  visitors  danes  or even crazy dudes with a ræv as an traditional Danish ølbong or even that camp with the poor shitty soundblaster which died in the queing. Invite them over  invite everybody over  and join the feeling together  the orange feeling  the feeling that only gets better when you can share it with a cold Rå in your hand  because who the fuck doesn't like beer in Camp Duebo.,0

Hey Roskilde.  Is it possible to see som pictures of the different get-a-tenth tenths? It would be nice to see what you are paying for before comitting to it.,0
The photo you see at the top of our Get A Tent page shows our small tent. We don't have pictures of the other tents - only the sizes (also on the page below)  http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent/,0
Here take my money! LOL!,0
And we found more. If you're interested in the 4-person tent  we've got some amateur-ish photos that should still give you an idea:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/GAT%204%20pers.jpeg  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/GAT%204%20pers%20%282%29.jpeg  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/GAT%204%20pers%20%283%29.jpeg,0
Thats sad.. It would be nice to know how ex. the x-large tent is  organized . How many people? Is there cabins? if yes  how many? etc.,0
Simon Bjørkvig  we managed to collect a little more info on this. Here you can see some drawings on the LARGE and X-LARGE tents. It's all very simply arranged.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/8p%20large_tent.pdf  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/12p%20xlarge_tent.pdf,0

Man  I wish I could go. I was there in 1993 and 1995. Funny story: in 1995  a Swedish guy who had had too many Carlsberg beers kicked over a lit camp stove  and burned down my tent. I wasn't inside  thankfully. The next day  the Danish man who was cooking drove to Copenhagen and bought me a new tent. He felt bad  even though he didn't do any of the stove kicking. That is hospitality. Have fun!,0

It's far from just metal:  KRAUKA (DK/IS) will start up a mighty viking party led by charismatic singer Gudjon Gudmundsson. He sings old sagas with an impressive voice that will make the ground shake.  VIRELAI (DK) will deliver an audience-involving party with elements of old Norse ballads  chain dance and acoustic techno – from the old market squares and straight to you.  PÄIVI HIRVONEN (FI) is a singer from Finland who plays the violin and an old Nordic lyre  an instrument used way back in the viking ages. In Hirvonen’s songs  power and emotion meet up  based on old traditions.  SONGLEIKR (NO/DK) consists of Christopher Juul and Maria Franz  known from acts like Valravn and Euzen. In this constellation they take on Norse folk music with beautiful harmonies which will surely crack the sky open.  ASYNJE (DK) employ electronic sounds and pulsating beats on a trip to our Norse roots. Nanna Barslev’s mesmerising voice opens the door to another time. Rustic old instruments conjure up grandiose  cinematic soundscapes.  SORTEN MULD (DK) had a commercial breakthrough in the early noughties with their fairy-tale-like mix of techno and folk music playing songs from the Viking age. “Ravnen flyver” became a radio hit and Sorten Muld kickstarted a wave of new music. This is a rare opportunity to experience Sorten Muld live.   SVARTSOT (DK) started in 2005 as the only Danish folk metal band. Now they’re one of the biggest around! Svartsot presents a meeting between the catchy tunes from the Middle Ages and melodic death metal. Downtuned guitars meet mandolin  bagpipes and flute.,0
We can try?,0
føj im out,0
Dis will be a day... To remember,0
Roskilde Festival will there be a vikingship though?,0
We should get Thor over for a sesh,0
Arriving at the festival today? Important information:  Leave early – we expect a lot of people arriving… A lot! Use public transportation to Roskilde Station. From here you can get to the festival area by train or bus.  Arriving by car? Use routes 6 or 14 from the south. Insist on using the freeway (route 21)? Fully charge your phone and bring your favorite playlist - you’ll probably be in a queue for quite some time.  The police will be in place to guide the traffic along. Please follow their instructions.,17
The freeway is route 21  -) We will also advice people to listen to the traffic announcements on Danish Broadcasting Company's radio stations! :-),0
U forgot to mention poop before u leave,0
Under the whole process you also have to remember to breath.  Instructions are here in this YouTube video.  http://youtu.be/B1w3s9m3hIg,0

Welcome to denmark  has nothing to do with the amounts of toilets  its a matter of culture and laziness,0
Entrance booking will be available later on. But you can easily buy your ticket now and book entrance later.,0
Get A Tent Central just sold out. However  we've found a little extra space - so if you want to camp right next to Orange Stage  you should act fast.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent/,20
What about Get a tent east? How is the sale?,0
So one stage down?,0
Jon Bolstad  tickets are still available for Get A Tent East.,0
Ja! Anne-Grethe!! :)) Where the fuck is Odeon???,0
Entrance booking  yes. We'll get to that later. Not that it's necessary for Get A Tent  though.,0
Odeon is no more. Cosmopol and Pavilion Junior too  but those two are superseded by Avalon and Rising respectively.,0
There will be toilets and baths like the rest of the campsite.,0
There will be a  Silent & Clean  area (most likely in J). But there are no special baths or toilets this year.,0
Want a Pet ? Here you go... he is called  Orri  and he is from Iceland.. this is his first year at the festival! The price is 3 fiddy! #RF15 #Roskilde #RFPiss #Iceland #Drunk,2

Hi John. Is it at get a tent Central or East? If it's east I'm happy to buy two from you.,0
You will have to Invite some more people John... We unfortunately can't change the amont of tents you bought,0
Sorry I got it wrong - I'm missing Central tents,0
Hi John! Do you still have extra tents? I wrote you a pm about buying some of them.,0
Hi Beto  Paul McCartney plays at 22.00  but unfortunatelly we won't broadcast it.,0
hello Roskilde Festival i was just wondering if there will be anywhere at the festival to watch the World Cup games...? ][specifically the England Football Team games...!!!] perhaps on a gigantic screen...? i really hope so... thanks :D,0
The usually show the games on big screen in the skate-city. No idea if they do this year  when Denmark isn't participating,0
World cup and Roskilde Festival. Very sweet combination! By Therese way  it would ruin alt for man yoghurt us  if we could not see the games.. Even though Denmark did not qualify :),0
great... tak for det... it's going to ruin my summer if i have to choose between them...!!!,0
I believe someone asked the exact same question some time ago on this page. The response from the festival was along the lines of them showing some of the games at least.,0
great... thanks guys... i WILL find a way to do both :D,0
Epic auto correct post! Should have been:  World cup and Roskilde Festival. Very sweet combination! By the way  it would ruin a lot for many of us  if we could not see the games.. Even though Denmark did not qualify :),0
Rasmus Bækby has 22 Roskilde Festival wristbands. This year he’ll get his 23rd. His favourite year was 1992 – his first time at Roskilde. Nirvana  Pearl Jam and Helmet played  Denmark won the European Championship and his camp “Helmet Lejren” was founded.  What was your favourite year at Roskilde Festival and why?,20
1993  my first year  with German friends. We met Swedish people and some I still meet there  but all the Germans have gone  I am the last one. Feeling older every year - but when Roskilde comes closer  the fever starts again. :-) Our Camp: Camp Evil. If you ever wondered that people were screaming  MAUL!  - it was us. Skandinavian people are generally proud to learn that word... :-D,0
4 Germans in our camp every year since forever so you're not the last one :),0
In fact 1 other German still comes  but he became & married Swedish.,0
1992 because it was the first out of ten Roskilde festivals I visited. 1996 was great for that time. in 2009 I married my wife in Roskilde on monday after the festival. (We are from germany´s saarland). 2010 was the last  because we are parents of two daughters now. As soon as possible we will bring them with us. For that time.Check it out Roskilde!,0
hey come on we are still there after all these years ... aber du hast Recht wir sind inzwischen Exoten da...  -),0
The Hellacopters are ready for a comeback at Roskilde Festival. The riff-loving hard rockers step in instead of Blink-182. They play the Arena stage on Wednesday 28 June at 23:00.  Tim Darcy is another new face in the line-up. Indie rock lovers know him as the front man of Ought. He steps in instead of Weyes Blood who has been forced to cancel due to personal reasons.  Hurry up if you want to attend Roskilde Festival 2017. We're very low on Full Festival Tickets. Don't wait if you want to go. One-day tickets for Saturday have just sold out.  www.roskilde-festival.dk/tickets,100
Aske Hvass  Hurry up if you want to attend Roskilde Festival 2017. We're very low on Full Festival Tickets. Don't wait if you want to go ,0
 Personal reasons ?  Seems to me that Weyes Blood would just rather like to be somewhere else on the globe...,0
Sofie Nybro What even?,0
Roskilde Festival Very poor replacement for a headliner...I think you have time to reconsider it and come up with a suitable option.,0
A lot better than shitty Blink but arena is too big for Hellacopters,0
Mia Sønderskov the fuck.. ):,0
Peter William Vinther Literally who,0
Niels Buch Jensen What is this,0
That. is. shit. A quick comparison in size: Spotify listenings on no. 1 hit song: Blink = 164 million.  Hellacopters = 4 5 million.  It's like replacing a gold nugget with dirt.,0
What is this shit. Why not Green day?,0
Grace Ngo this is disappointing,0
Jamie Morris who the fuck are the Hellacopters,0
Oh Dave Burnette will be very happy about this!,0
Johan Kindt Who dis,0
We planned everything around Wednesday just to see Blink 182 (flights and accommodation) and now you decided to change it? Really bad organization. Want my money back!,0
Barsel Catalgøl seen this??,0
http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7431229/blink-182-california-drake-views-no-1-on-billboard-200-albums-chart  Hellacopters: never been on any billboard.  So  Roskilde Festival  want to give that a second try and find an equivalent band instead of some local band?,0
Roskilde Festival how can you put The Hellacopters on Arena and Rag and Bone Man on Avalon they are 30min apart from their respective schedule. Have you seen Rag'N'Bone Man youtube hits? 287 million! The Hellacopters 1 million?! Why dont you switch stages? There must be a crowd safety in perspective on this matter? #orangefeeling #festivalsafety,0
If anyone is seriously disappointed that The Hellacopters are replacing Blink 182 I feel truly sad about modern festival visitors choice in music.  #grumpyoldfartwhocantellgoodmusicfromshit,0
Fredrik Look who is coming to the Roskilde Festival :D,0
He's in the photo  which is new  so it surely looks like it.,0
jemals von denen gehört! :D,0
go to hell-icopter ??,0
The fuck is this... ??,0
Looks like i'm joining U than ??,0
Hellacopters have played both Arena and Orange Stage before.,0
Anders Cold Yeah in their prime.,0
Blink-182 weren't headlining.,0
hah jepp  could've been worse,0
åbenbart :D,0
But they aint getting it,0
rip that blink 182 song..,0
Yeah.. 'Cause plays on Spotify really tells you alot about the qualit of the music..,0
Simon Heggum Lol. Ofc music is subjective  but you cannot even start to compare these two bands. Not even their sound is remotely alike. Let me refrase: It's like comparing a giant to an ant.,0
they were closing the day on the Arena stage,0
Oh my goodness. xD Hvornår kommer du  btw?  D,0
What the fuck,0
what the hell,0
it shit,0
Nanna this comment though,0
Because Green Day is 10-15 times as expensive as even Blink-182. They don't have a spare slot at the Orange Stage to give. They have an Arena slot and for that purpose  Hellacopters fits the bill.,0
You can bet they've tried.,0
Floriana Laura Taiti? That's not headlining.,0
Decidedly not Blink 182 ??,0
Get over it Rasmus!!,0
Ok  if this makes you happy they are not  headliners  they are just the main act on the Arena stage. Still not a proper replacement  ),0
Honestly would be better if they'd said   we couldn't get a replacement for Blink  but we've also booked this awesome other band . Ah well  clashed with Bonobo anyway!,0
Troels Valentin Ebbesen Are you ten years old? They've played 3 times before on roskilde festival,0
sum 41 said no,0
WHO da fuk is that!? ??,0

No clue who they are tho,0
Anders Cold this^,0
Same,0
Dude  i JUST turned 20 last week. But because i'm 20 doesn't mean my music pool has to be that deep and if i wanted your opinion on my age i would have asked the entire thread so to be frank  fuck off,0
The amount of people raped in the a** is to damn high,0
Thomas Wentrup get the Hella' da here!,0
Sum 41  All time low  all american rejects  good charlotte. There are enough bands out there to play at arena :D,0
It's the band you have to blame. They pulled out.,0
I blame to whom I made business with and in this case it was the festival. Blink182s excuse was that their schedule was too tight and this was something that the organizers should have into account a year or months ago when they signed the band. So in fact is the festival to blame as well!,0
I don't get how the festival is to blame for blink182 having a to tight schedule? ??,0
Well that's the whole reason of the blame: how do you sign a band that has a tight schedule?,0
Sorry to hear about your trouble  Ricardo.  When we book bands we expect them to commit to the deal they're making. We don't know what else they're planning. The fact that they choose to cut out three dates in the middle of their touring schedule still baffles us. But it's their choice and it's them letting down thousands of fans. We don't see how we can be to blame for that.,0
Ricardo López Pumarejo It's the bands fault  entirely. The festival got just as much screwed over as you.,0
Fuck Blink. They dont care about their fans.,0
Viktor Vestling Not bad :P,0
Hellacopters are frickin awesome... well done roskilde for getting them in at such a late notice... now i wish i was goin!! Enjoy... if you dont know them do that thing us music lovers do... go find... listen... and rock the fuck out!!,0
So Ricardo  let me just get this straight: You make a straight up appointment with a popular plumber to fix your toilet. He then calls you up while brown water reaches your ankles and says hes not coming. Without giving further explanation. And then you blame... yourself? How on earth can his inability to keep a simple calendar ever be your fault? A deal's a deal  right? Well  just go anyway and stay for the week. Theres plenty of other bands and even more people worth your trip.,0
Hans  not 'a billboard' - Billboard. The only globally ranking hit list that I could think of  which measures if bands have had a hit in a number of countries (including Sweden) So my point is that it seems strange to take a band that was never really good enough to be liked by many people (I.e. Largely unknown)  will never be so as they are has beens  and then replace a band known by the majority of Festival guest. It is probably a good band with hundreds of dedicated fans  it is just inappropriate to replace a ban known by 90% of the guests.,0
Jens Hovgaard Jensen Never really good enough to be liked by many?  Are you kidding me? The Hellacopters were huge within their genre and out played all the similar bands  but they had the integrity to never sell out to be the next Blink 182. Backstreet Boys was huge back in the days  why do you think they were? Was it because they were good or because MTV  and all the good damn radio stations played their shit music all day long? Same goes for Blink 182  it's all about exposure and what the record industry wants you to hear.,0
Jens Räsänen sorry about that  I am sure they are good and their fans like them and let me underline that first. Also  I hope you will enjoy their concert.  Now if Foo Fighters cancel and Roskilde replace it with Thomas Helmig (someone who once was big in Denmark and had and still has many fans)  that will be an upside for Thomas' fans for sure. And by many standards he was good (not my cup of tea but anyway...)  It is just not what most people in the world would call a  fair trade  and thereby an appropriate replacement.  Roskilde is about the mix of bands and Blink 182 and whats-their-name are just not in the same category  whether that is the labels  MTVs or my fault I cannot say. So the big crowd pleaser that Roskilde fortunately also bring in  cannot be replaced by local besties.  Again  I am not arguing if Hellacopters belong on Roskilde  I dont challenge whether their fans like their music etc. I just say that it is NOT a bloody replacement to a huge known band with tons of hits that EVERYONE can sing along to.   Now I am happy to continue the debate on THAT  but pls dont tell me how good your favorite band is - that is redundant information and off topic.,0
Hans Jakob Bjørheim now that you have edited your comment  could you also add these facts for Blink 182  and thank you for helping me underline and prove my point - that was VERY nice of you!,0
who the fuck is the hellacopters  literally verdens værste replacement,0
Carl Isaksson Öberg Sorry about that  that is now corrected.,0
We are well aware of how many Youtube hits Rag’n’Bone Man has. But streaming numbers are not the only thing to take into consideration in our work. There's a big difference between an artist with a big radio hit and a band that hasn't released anything in the 'streaming age'.  When we programme  we look at where the artists (and the audience) get the best setting for a show  how the flow is on-site and  of course  capacity and expected turnup. Sometimes it results in concerts that are relatively packed - something we're ready to handle.,0
Thanks for the answer  Much appreciated!??  I prefer listening to rock live  but Would rather experience Rag'N'Bone Man than Hellacopters and i'm not the only one especially after blink 182s cancellation. I really hope you good guys have assessed the situation. There is no worse than a misplaced act and overcrowded venue that ruin a good experience. Maybe I sound old but you have to consider the safety of the crowd. Stay Orange - looking forward to see you at the other side of the fence????,0
I have to second the concern. I believe Rag n Bone Man will draw the bigger crowd.The ones enjoying Red Fang on Avalon  will probably go for Hellacopters as well  so considering crowd-flow  putting them on the same stage two hours later  seems like the proper solution...,0
Stop thinking numbers. Either YOU like the band  or not  billboard or not.,0
My point with the numbers were that they are not  some local band ,0
Wait what!???? That's gonna be sick! I need to go now! ??,0
https://m.popkey.co/ca8f87/AoYjv_f-maxage-0.gif,0
Hi Hans  well - arguably - you started with the numbers but when the point you made was to my advantage  then you don't want to look at numbers :D    Yes  they are  some local band  in comparison to the ones they are replacing. Again  I am not saying anything about your music taste or the local bands you like  my point is that they are by far no proper replacement for the ones that was taken off the poster. If Hellacopters were replacing Baest (playing on the Rising stage on Monday)  that would be an amazing trade-up compared to whom they replace and equally disproportionate towards the well known.  Baest's hundreds of fans would be disappointed and the thousands of Hellacopter fans would be happy.   Here  it is the other way around and that is simply a cheap trick from Roskilde and they should have done more to find a band in the right league instead of cheating their guests.,0
Hans Jakob Bjørheim Carl Isaksson Öberg and Jens Räsänen  I would like to apologise for any personal offence taken - that was never the point.  My critique is purely at Roskilde Festival for being cheap. If you want to meet up for a beer on me during Roskilde I am free Wednesday around 23.30 when either The Weeknd or Kevin Morby is done playing (have not decided which one to listen to yet) :D,0
Hi Jens. It's ok to feel disappointed about a favourite band cancelling out on us all (still baffled about that one)  but calling us 'cheap' is both untrue and unfair.  We've tried all we could to land the best band we could instead of Blink. We tried various solutions (both in the pop-punk department and beyond)  but when we're in the 11th hour we can't just pick and choose any band we'd like. So it's not a matter of going for a  cheap  band but going for whatever comes close enough. We're sure that most fans would prefer a rock band over an act in a completely different genre - at least that was out starting point in this case.,0
Jens Hovgaard Jensen  The Hellacopters are the most influental Swedish band ever. More influental than massive bands like (crappy) Kent Ebba Grön.,0
Jari Rovanperä I appreciate they are 'good in Sweden' - and I do not challenge that. That is not the same as being globally good. Thomas Helmig is good in Denmark  he is just not a fair replacement either.,0
Roskilde Festival I appreciate you take the time to answer.  By no means does this ruin my festival (rain does though) but it is a sad replacement and this would be where you need to spend to compensate by paying for more and better. And you cannot convince me that the price tag is similar despite it being last minute.,0

 I made out with a nice girl at the mosh pit at a Slipknot concert in 2013. I found out her dad was there  so I backed down  as he was kinda like  hey  stay away from my daughter . I got her number  but then I lost the phone the same night. The next day  I saw that she had put a message in Orange Press saying: 'hey  it was me with the face paint from the Slipknot concert last night. What happened to you?' I went looking for her  but I never found her. I wonder happened to her..?

I'm not sure Maree  it probably is. It's a music festival.,0

The Rockwool shelter doesn't have a fixed floor. The Tenthouse is on legs which gives you full protection.  But hey  what's this talk about rain? We've ordered sun - and lots of it.,0
Hi Roskilde Festival - I am pretty sure you are linking the wrong artist for Volvox on your official Spotify playlist and in the Discwoman description on your website. You are linking a male dubstep artist whereas the one from Discwoman is a female acid techno DJ.,0
Thanks a lot for spotting that error!,0

Hallo all of you... i´v Got my ticket  thats great. But i read in a swedich tabloid newspaper today  that the Rollingstones are coming  is it true  ? The tabloid is Kvällsposten in Malmö  Sweden.,0
It is but a rumour. The source is BT  which is just about Denmark's most unreliable tabloid. They were right about Bruce Springsteen in 2012 and wrong about Daft Punk last year  so I wouldn't count on anything.,0
Bruce Springsteen was tour in 2012 and Prince was on tour in 2010. Daft Punk was not on tour in 2013 and The Stones will tour Europe this summer and playing at festival in Belgium week before Roskilde. Never say never. So there is still hope :),0
Can´t helping hoping.,0
We can’t wait to see you at Roskilde Festival 2014,26

The difference to Roskilde is that even if the ticket is quite costly. Parking isn't that much of a problem most take public transport anyways. Denmark in early July is generally neither too hot nor too cold. Stages are very upclose and personal if you want to. Everything is reasonably priced. Queues to toilets are non-existent for guys  tolerable for girls. And since from frame we learned that most take public transport traffic isn't too bad.,0
And we have full sets!,0

Hi BT and Gaffa claims that Rolling Stones is playing at Roskilde 2014... Is it true??  http://www.bt.dk/musik/den-er-god-nok-...-rolling-stones-spiller-paa-roskilde-festival-2014,0
Interesting. Unfortunately  we don't comment on rumours.,0
But you do when it comes to Pearl Jam or RATM so...,0

I've got the blues...,0
Have i missed anything or are you not able to book entrance this year? I just don't feel like I've heard anything about it yet? - Should i just meet up and expect chaos? ,0
They claim they are working on it. But regardless of them having booking entrances or not...expect chaos  ),0
We make it available later. Hang in there.,0
there will be a possibility to buy ticket now and add on the entrance bookuing later I assume?  and please give usa freakin estimate WHEN the entrance booking (or whichever chaos you decide Sunday to become) will be avaliable.,0
Anders Lindstrom  that is definitely possible.,0
We can't give you a date yet. But there's no problem in getting a ticket now and using it for entrance booking later.,0
Do you know who is in your troops? ,0
jesus fucking christ heard rumors about rolling stones...  dear god i would like to ask you to get rolling stones to play at #rf14 amen. the only thing i´ve been doing since i got my ticket  please roskilde... i´m not even religious!,0

I took this at the 1995 Roskilde Festival. What a great time!,0
15 years ago they played Roskilde Festival’s smallest stage. This year they performed at Orange stage  less than 24 hours after an audience of 85000 sung along with Bruce Springsteen and only a few hours before Björk took the same stage. Amadou & Mariam made an interview backstage:http://addisrumble.com/?p=2052,3
My best friend and I live in Seoul  Korea and we've visited various Rock Festivals in the world since 1999.   We were in Rock Im Park(DE)  Hurricane(DE)  V Festival(UK)  Rock Werchter(BE)  Bangkok 100 Rock(TH)  FUJI(JP)  Summersonic(JP) and many Korean Rock Festivals.    Whenever we go to a festival  it’s so amazing and bring us to a truly new world. We are crazy about Rock n' Roll just like you guys. And Major Lazer is so special to us~!.   6 years ago  we were told about 'Roskilde' from a Swedish friend who we met at Hurricane and he said  There's the biggest one in the North Europe. You should go to ROSKILDE where I go every summer.    We searched about infomation about Roskilde on the internet and we fell in love with it immediately just after looking at some pics. ROSKILDE became our  MUST-GO FEST' and we’ve dreamed about it for a long time.    Just last week we finally found out this shocking competition of Roskilde 2014. We were so excited and shouted together  Now  It's about time!!!!    We took many pics at some nice places in Seoul and lazergramed them. Everyone in the venue was looking at us and asked  What are you guys doing?  and we answered  We are taking memorable pics to go to the most fxxing awesome festival in the world     We hope you guys would enjoy this pics.    Can you help us take this big chance from the other side of the earth?  We really really wanna go to ROSKILDE!!  Here we go!!  #rf14 #roskilde #majorlazer #lazergram #mad4roskilde #rockfestival #denmark #seoul #southkorea #rocknroll #fromseoultoroskilde #roskildefestival http://instagram.com/mad4roskilde,0

Quick question: We're planning on staying in Silent & Clean and have all booked the correct ticket/entrance etc. But last year  we all ran for the wrong entrance to Area J. Can you tell us whether we can enter through the entrance closest to South (red mark on the right) or if we have to go around the lake like last year (red mark on the left)? Thanks in advance - we can't wait!!!,0

Roskilde Festival is more than music  art  food and parties. Much more. It's also a week-long celebration of togetherness and community. This sense of community is something we want to encourage all year  not least through donations and cooperation with organisations working for a more equal society.  Through the years  Roskilde Festival Charity Society has supported several projects working for active citizenship and increased participation in democracy  both locally and nationally. Therefore we've donated a total of DKK 650 000 to Foreningen Folkemødet  Foreningen Demokratiscenen and Foreningen Folkemøde Møn.,7
Se her: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2017/rent-you-own-personal-refrigerated-locker,0
It certainly is hot and sunny! Thanks for letting us know  meanwhile  make sure to keep using that sunscreen!,0
You could maybe make a room for showering  and then the girls would have to enter another HUGE area to put on make-up and dry your hair etc. Some of the girls needs more make-up and are slower than others  so it's actually not the shower that's taking so long  but the things after.,0

What do you like to eat at Roskilde Festival?,1
Hi Roskildeeeee! Quick question - some of our campers have Silent & Clean pre-bookings  but only half of the camp. Is there any way our fellow campers can help us set up our camp without the special wristband? Or do we need to wait until midnight for them to join us? Thank you!,0
Hi Lisa - they will need to wait... Only you guys with Silent and Clean pre-bookings can get in before,0
Thank you for your quick reply  we'll just park them under an agora with some brew and it'll be fine  ),0
That sounds like the perfect plan Lisa. Cheers!,0
The link to see the map on your website isn't working. Is this fixable so we can see the entrances and camp sites etc.?,0
Thanks for heads up! Try this while we fix the other one: http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2005/rf17_map_silent-clean.pdf,0
Or maybe this one is actually better: http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2005/rf17_map_.pdf,0

Thanks everybody! We've now reached 300 000 likes on Facebook. To celebrate this  we are giving DKK 300 000 to GAME  an organisation working to give all kids access to sports and culture by offering street sports.,12

The tickets didn't sell as fast as we expected. We still expect to be sold out  though.,0
im kind of curious about what you procedure of finding another act when a band needs to cancel and you need to find another act?  like with Blink 182.? :),0
Unfortunately I need to sell my Full Festival Ticket and also my Tenthouse Ticket. You can have both for 4400 dkk together or each for it's face value. Please contact me directly if you are interested.,0
Hi Arnold  unfortunately  Saturday is completely sold out.,0
Thanks for your answer :),0
I think the Line-up so far looks very promising! Last year was almost too good  where I had to prioritize a bit too much. That was of course a bit of a luxury problem. I believe there will be some sweet surprises when full Line-up is released. Anyway this year will be my 10. Roskilde and that anniversary has to be celebrated  ),0
Rolling Stones?  That's the answer i was looking for.  Wanna try to top it with a touch of Bowie?,0
What Kent said. Let's judge April 2nd.,0
Oh  you bet i will judge  ),0
Yo Klinke Hans.  What's not to like?   Arctic Monkeys released last years best rock-blues album? Have you heard it? It's awesome!   Major Lazor is probably the most festive name out there. A great party on Orange Stage!   Damon Albarn will play some of the great Blur-tracks  which are legendary plus his new material.   Outkast is on of the best hip hop acts ever existed and they have never played in Denmark before.   Plus some excellent new comers in the charismatic Earl SweatShirt  the talented girls from Haim  insane rock from Rob Zombie and on and on...   You should explore the music a little bit...,0
Yo Bobby =)  I just think it looks kinda thin to be a festival of this size  Arctic Monkeys & Damion Albarn are pretty good  Haim are a great liveband. Lykke Li is also something i look forward to.  Major Lazer... not sure  ) I have never liked Outkast or Rob Zombie (but i do respect that they have their fans)  I have been attending RF since 1995  and I wouldnt have done that if i didn't love it.,0
Sounds good - +20 years at Roskilde is a just a few more than me  but I will catch up! :-)   Than we're kind of on the same page.   Both of us looking forward to a great festival... :-),0
When will it be possible to buy tickets with entrance booking?,0
We'll make entrance booking available later. But don't let that stop you from buying a ticket now. People with tickets can easily make an entrance booking as well.,0
D A D!!! please!! ,0
Doubt i   they are playing almost every other danish Festival.,0
Need a ticket for today and tomorrow. Full week pass would work. Pm me,0
Ok  Roskilde people. We’ve got more music for you tomorrow at 9. While you wait  see if you can crack this one.  Approx. Facebook likes: 10 000 - 20 000 - 30 000 - 1 300 000,9

The painting in the right hand corner must be I Break Horses. It's a clairobscur- or chiaroscuro-painting. 'Chiaroscuro' is also the title of their latest album  they're from Sweden and have 20.000 likes on Facebook. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWmYpjWHT8E,0
Robyn & Röyksopp and or I Break Horses i hope.,0
Alright. Time to see who guessed it first!  The background shows the two nationalities at play – Sweden and Iceland.  As Nick Bunthan showed Lykke Li did a live session called “Live On The Moon”. That’s why you see the orange stage  projectors and a microphone placed on the moon. Ari Steinn Skarphéðinsson was the first to guess Lykke Li.  Anders Cold was the first to guess I Break Horses. His explanation was spot on: “The painting in the right hand corner must be I Break Horses. It's a clairobscur- or chiaroscuro-painting. 'Chiaroscuro' is also the title of their latest album  they're from Sweden and have 20.000 likes on Facebook.”  The mouth and the speech bubble with the girl inside is Say Lou Lou. Simon Svendsen posted the Metallica/Lou Reed - ”Lulu” album cover from which the photo was taken. Özgür Kurtoglu  was the first to guess it.  Samaris has their name from the comic book world (http://www.thefourohfive.com/news/article/the-405-meets-samaris-1). Queen Samaris is a character from The Phantom. Her photo is cut out from this comic book cover: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0Br2eXBQ3oE/S2FZxwBUvuI/AAAAAAAACjg/K6AHewiqVLg/s1600/FREW-Samaris.jpg. Nina Lund Westerdahl was the first and only one to guess Samaris.  Good job everybody!,0

So in the past the warm up started on Friday or Saturday  and now we can't get in until Sunday? When did this change? The fence doesn't get taken down early anymore? ,0
We've never started on a Friday. A couple of years back we moved the opening a day back – from Sunday to Saturday. In 2014 we're moving it back to Sunday again.  Are you visiting us again in 2014?,0
Actually  the camp opening on Saturday already has only been a  'thing' for four years. In 2009 and before it was Sunday  just like this year.,0
Yeah  but wont people just break down the fence again? Also I went from 2007-2010 and I think 2008-2009 we started to camp on Saturday.,0
My point is people will line up on Saturday for sure  and I imagine the fence will be brought down again. If last year it came down on saturday  I think it will happen again this year.,0
In 2008 the camp didn't open until Sunday morning. In 2009 the fence was toppled really early on  much to the dismay of my camp who couldn't be there until hours later.  I think the time of day also has a lot to say. The past few years with opening on Saturday evening  people generally has been behaving somewhat civilised  not toppling the fence until pretty late in the day.,0
Technically there really isn't a fence to take down. The last time you went was the last time they used a fence.  Also note that opening was scheduled for Saturday last year  and people stormed in on West about 29 minutes before it was supposed to open.  There are several speculations about why that happened but most likely it was due to volunteer workers trying to jump the gun and secure a camping spot before the official opening.  However  I completely agree. People will queue on Saturday since they have nothing else to do so why not queue early. It's usually a party anyways. Some time during the evening or night the camping site will get stormed. I see it as an absolute certainty that will happen.  Instead the festival should have cut the last Sunday and kept that as a traveling day. Keeping some shops and the camping ground open until 18:00. From a logistics PoV that makes perfect sense as people are generally leaving Sunday anyways  and there aren't that many people left when the last concerts are playing. In that sense it's not like the  old days  when people generally left Monday. Now they leave early due to having to work and for the simple fact that it's cheaper and easier to travel on Sundays.  Roskilde Festival just have a problem keeping up with the way society and their audience's behavioural patterns have changed.,0
Sorry  but its not easier and cheaper to travel on Sundays.,0
Yes  but earlier you opened Sunday at 08.00 in the morning. This year it will be 6. p.m.,0
You can see all the films from this year here :) Maybe your film is among,0
Sometimes the most magical memories are shaped in the very early moments of the morning. If you happened to pass by the swimming lake early Tuesday  you would have spotted something quite strange and beautifull - with Soffie Viemose,11

Unfortunately  we must inform you that US band Blink-182 has cancelled parts of the planned European tour and thus the announced performance at this summer’s Roskilde Festival.  The band states:  “When we booked the tour last year  we were confident that we would be able to make the whole run work. However  we are now further limited in our ability to travel and will have to find a time to reschedule in the near future. Apologies to all of our fans who have bought tickets and were looking forward to these shows but we'll be back soon.”  We are currently working to fill the open slot on the Arena stage that this leaves us with.,153

Disappointing news but hopefully something just as good will be announced,0
Just find a rock eller punk act to replace them. No more rap at roskilde! The reformed +Live+ would be awsome,0
I don't care about Blink 182  has beens as they are. But your program is starting to look mighty thin.,0
Sign up some classic rock band from the 70s or 80's just like you always did years age and let the young people chill out to some long forgotten tune  for example  Foreigner  Journey  Kansas  Styx etc.    Sometimes looking back is a good way to look forward in music  which is what Roskilde prides itself with. Alternatively what about some of the bands from Manchester or Bristol from the 80's / 90s. Just an idea ??,0
Good riddance! (y),0
Sign up migos n young thug,0
 We were told that Mikkel Keilberg wasn't attending at Roskilde festival this year  so there's no reason for us to attend either   ??????,0

Nope  not in 2017. They were here in 2006  though.,0
Yay! Then I just have to finish my time machine! :),0
Roskilde Festival - get Them instead of Blink-182... ????????????,0
I wonder why you tagged me in this ????,0
No reason~??,0
Same,0
 I'm totally broke at the moment  so I couldn't go to Roskilde this year  which I of course accepted...to begin with. But after sitting at home  watching everyone there share tons of magical moments  something inside me snapped. So I crossed the line and asked my Facebook friends for donations so I could buy a ticket for a day and go to the festival. After 3 hours I already had WAY more than i needed  which was overwhelming and heartwarming. So now I'm paying it forward  giving away beers to camps in need.  Peter  37  Denmark.  HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants! #RF15,31
With all due respect there are more needy people than you. If people are feeling so generous they should donate to charity,0
Lovely story! Everyone deserves a break from the everyday life - and you are a good guy! Asking for help and giving it back. ??????This story is the true orange feeling! ????,0
I love the Danish. I believe this is based on their spirit. The whole world could learn something here. ??????,0
Peace  Love  Unity and Respect :-),0
We know nothing about this guy  so let's not judge  okay? If he was a total asshole no-one would have  donated  any money for him to get a ticket. So  obviously he must be a person of some kind of good character since his buddies gave him quite a bit of money to go and have a few days of fun. Who knows? Maybe his life isn't very exciting and his friends wanted to do him a massive favor to go and have a little bit of fun. Come on you haters!  ) Karma is nice to the ones who wish others well :D You'll only feel worse if hating on others. So  chin up! There'll come a time for you  too  to be happy in life :),0
That's the spirit!,0
A lot of service functions and foodstalls needs volunteers. A mere 32 hours and most likely something to eat and drink  while on his shifts. But then again  maybe his hunger for #RF15 wasn't that big  after all.,0
You're a star  Peter. Well deserved and beer is always a good way to pay it forward. Enjoy #rf15,0
If anyone deserved this  this is the man! Go Peter!,0
Danish people probably the nicest of all Thanks for helping him out/ I think all the money roskilde Recieving based on concert profit they could actully build the worlds largest shelter for those inneed I wish I had enough money to build that and also providing food stuff like that wish me luck so I can do this someday for all :p,0
Dont point fingers of a guy  whom wants to say thanks  with a beer in payof respect ! Thanx for sharing what you can share ! Yaaaaaarr !!  -),0
This is what people are donating for? Some dude to GO to some festival that supports humanitarian efforts... and give out free beer? Why not just donate to the festival and/or organizations themselves... what a waste.,0
Well ain't this just the most important charity to support. ????,0
Yay Peter Brodersen - way to go! :-),0
Did Rik,0
You are amazing ?? hope you have a great time!,0
- Beatiful Contry Denmark (Y) nice Peapols !,0
That (Bringing you own beer) is in the Netherlands forbidden :-(,0
This is one of the reasons why I love the Danish people so so much ! ??,0
To all of you hating on Peter - you don't know anything! So stop. He is a hell of a good guy  doing things for other people all the time. Because he is such a good and giving guy 72 of his friends and acquaintances decided to sponsor his trip to Roskilde.  After receiving more than he needed  he wanted to give back the surplus and we told him to use them on himself on Roskilde. Because he deserves it! Someone asked that he give beers to strangers if he really wanted to give something to others  so he did. That's what the photo is about.,0
You my man  el capitano!,0
Seems like he's short on clothes as well ...,0
Absolutely anybody deserves a free pass at anything every once in a while. Congratulations for Peter reaching the festival and congratulations for all the people that helped him. Life would be easier if these things happened more often.,0
All profit from Roskilde Festival goes to charity:) So The money he received is well spend:),0
Should we ask for donations  as well! Haha   Belle Amao  Hazel Anne Laureano ??  Good job Peter ????,0
Awesome  Peter!  Go go go :D,0
O-feeling,0
Anne Sofie Brask let me know if you see this guy  ) ????,0
You're a legend mate! Well done for stepping up and asking. You don't receive if you don't ask!,0
Allan Konts you if ya keep goin la roche hahah,0
Thumps up  enjoy every moment! Don't miss my favorite Danish band  Kashmir  and  Mew  !! Danish rock..ROCK!,0
Hello everybody I am Mexican Brazilian  and I didn't have money to go to this festival and my friend from Denmark Thomas Kaleidoskop Mellerup found me a job as a volunteer 3 years ago  it was the best experience ever  I love Denmark ???? and the Danish girls more ??! Skål! PS. I drank too much and I smoked too much as the Danish  I almost die  but it was the best! Much Love from Latinamerica! ????????,0
Think I might have had one of your beers near a pizza place??,0
Missing those warm tuborg slabs Mmmmm.. Bonnie-Jean Ward Matthew James Claire Xian,0
Love it!,0
Roskilde's proceeds are going to charity  so it's kinda full circle  huh?,0
Well aren't you a glorious guy. Go do some charity  and let the bastard enjoy his festival  giving away free beer.,0
Charity is charity.   Doing things for your friends? That screams Orange Feeling to me. Bashing a man whose friends helped him get a great experience? Doesn't quite scream Orange Feeling to me.,0
just shut the f up and let this dude have a good time  man!,0
And Jack  to follow you up  I guess you are not buying food or anything this summer  but giving all the money away? Ey  Ey EY?,0
You can be pretty certain someone's going to be disrespectful when they start their sentence at  With all due respect . Like it's a get out of jail card post rage -  u cant get mad bro  toldya I was gunna drop some mad lines . Put your money where you mouth is and focus on those needy people  not bashing down-on-times people who got a rise from friends and family.,0
We all give to charity one way or another   this is how he dose it   we'll all do it in different ways it doesn't matter how,0
I wish more people would see what you see..  Much love!',0
I see a guy who is like any other guy who yearned for something that he wanted. Passion was met with charity  for that time  for that place. There is nothing but this instance and it reveals the beauty  nobility and humility of the human spirit without any extreme circumstances or conditions. This picture of this event is a human being Danish  and Danish people being human. I only wish people from the world  around could understand as well my friend. The way to charity and peace is just by acting upon it. I experienced that culturally in Denmark. It wasn't just an idea  it more the way of life.,0
Danish people gives to charity every year. It runs on the taxes in the country. In danish its called 'ulandsbistand'.,0
Let's do it??,0
The Danish are inspiring and awesome! I love all of my Danish friends so much ??,0
Do denmark have shelter home for homeless I m talking about the 1 that's free to stay as long as u want ?,0
Or maybe he hadn't an entire week to spare because of work elsewhere?,0
Jack  danes gives to charity every single month through taxes. And Roskilde Festivel is for charity as well. What he did when buying the beers was actually to give a percentage to charity. Give the man a break and a good experience.,0
Collect cans. You could afford your own apartment  in Denmark. Nothing is perfect anywhere  but the Dane's are probably near the closest. Imagine... Just imagine... In Denmark you can live this way. I would be back in university in a second  collecting cans  drinking amazing beer  smoking amazing Moroccan hash  and playing my guitar. I'd probably get daring and take... Botany ...,0
Ragib Siddiqui: we do,0
Don't get so butthurt..,0
The struggle is real,0
Because he is our friend  and he Always spread light and Life around him. So when he asked his friends  on his personal Facebook profile  we send him pocket change. When you have many friends  it might just happen that people spend the money for a beer or a pizza on you. This time send it instead... Some of us at  Roskilde because we wanted to see him. Now when 75 people send you money for at pizza  it adds up. How did you come to hate so much?,0
2 weekends = 4 shifts or Fri Sat sun = 3 shifts,0
He's definately a good guy! He spends most of his time thinking about others  that's why his friends chipped in :),0
Is it a waste to give to your friends?,0
I understand but the winter probably gonna cut me in half I heard it's very cold over dere,0
Roskilde festival is non-profit. All the Money they earn goes to charity. So this is a Way of both giving your buddy a nice day AND give to charity. Get your facts straight!,0
It's not like he was begging from random strangers. He just asked if his friends could spare some pocket change  and since he has A LOT of friends  due to being a very nice guy who always helps others  loads of people send him a tiny bit of money and it added up. Have you never had a good friend give you anything?,0
Have you ever attempted living in Canada? Better yet... If the rest of the world followed the Danish way it wouldn't matter what temperature you lived in. You'd survive. 1000 kr a month is a pretty good resource not to ever end up homeless.,0
My cousin lives there my uncle moved to Texas  cause of weather so I assume not all would enjoy as much as I m enjoying in new jersy :),0
We have a cold winter. But We also have a warm jacket on. :D,0
Good 1 :D but during sandy power was out if that happens in canda u guys are doomed Cause no heater and all that so u all gotta wear Inuit clothing bahahahah,0
Lol the colonies can't afford total independence  but they have their own gowerment. And Zoophilia isnt alloweded anymore thanks to Dan Jørgensen  the old rules just said that animals coldnt be hurt in any way.,0
Hahaha maybe.  But i love to live in Denmark. We have free doctor and we can get money if we dont have a Job.  But er Pay alot more taxes than you do. I Pay 39%. And that is the lowest we pay.   (Sorry about my english. Im so bad at it. But i Hope you understand) :),0
Which colonies ? U mean iceland and Greenland ?,0
Belive he is talking about  Færøerne  dont know what they are called in english and Greenland.,0
He is a good guy  he helped me move when I was pregnant!,0
Or maybe his friends thought he deserved some time off. Let the man enjoy the festival. He deserves it.,0
You don't know if he is homeless,0
nothing better than an urine sandstorm and house facilities out of a 3rd world country  but atleast theres pleanty of (warm..) beer,0
 Nigga get that camera away from me  i'm trying to pick up chicks ,0
We're open for donations. ??,0
I will ??,0
He's an AWESOME guy  in fact. :-),0
Good things come to good people :),0
When some don' t have water to drink...what a shame,0
A meme is born,0
Id be happy to look like this now haha Jamie Holland,0
Sorry but denmark law is a bit communist type u are not allowed 2  have knives or guns so  usa is better  far better when it comes to certain rights and thang for sure   I won't enjoy paying all my taxes cause u gotta get paid enough for that  Only reason I love denmark it's cause they have good tolerate people and beautiful girls and all that overall very clean and peaceful but don't care about there harsh law.,0
The harsh laws are one of the reasons that it is peaceful in denmark... there is no good reason for everyone to run around waving their guns...,0
Man it's been a year since then that's fucked!!!!!,0
Whatever  its ur law u follow but that's stupid and that's not equal rights if person can not defend themselves Then what's the difference between communist China and Denmark? The reason denmark is safe cause america is protecting europe   It was not peaceful when nazi invaded  people often forget the past.,0
Cause they r hot,0
Danish girls are the fucking best I think compare to Americans I think they much taller and hot,0
Ragib Siddiqui: We don't need a gun for protection  we would only need a gun for protection if everyone ran around with a gun in their hand. In USA you've got a lot of school shootings  we don't. I think that's a big part of the Danish gun-law.   Wtf? USA protecting Europe? Yes  it was good you guys helped with the nazi. But hey  the war wasn't lost?,0

I really want to recommend the amazing and powerful band  Triggerfinger  from Belgium ... Pure powerhouse and sooo much energy on stage!!! <3   They can be a great success with you at the Roskilde Festival next year! Please - Give them a chance!  You will not be disappointed! <3 ,0
The ticket for a single Kronos Quartet concert is mostly more expensive than the hole 4-days-Roskilde-ticket  so take a look at them at 12h at the Avalon. I would be there if I was there...,0

As an event for next year  I want to share with you an idea that I had at this year festival! If people are up for it  we're going to arrange a toasting  but not just any toasting! You should be able to hear this all over the festival  from east shores to west shores  and all the way out to the caravans!! The toast will happen at thursday  16.59  and will last one minute!!! This could get big.. This could get REALLY big!,0

Book Neutral Milk Hotel. Please. They're already performing at Øya this summer. Please. Neutral Milk Hotel. Book. Please. Come on. Please. Neutral Milk Hotel. Do it. Please. Book. ,0
such capital letters,0
They're also playing their own gig in Copenhagen in August. That probably means they won't be at Roskilde.,0
Sadly they're not available: http://www.sasquatchfestival.com/lineup/july,0
It's easier if you contact us. Info@roskilde-festival.dk,0
Alright. Do you want it on english or danish?,0
Danish is fine. But in here we only write in English :-),0
Thank you for Bruce Springsteen. The show was AWESOME :),0
Roskilde Festival 2012 is over  we know you miss it  we do too  but not really this part...Right?,29
I miss reading all those crazy notes written inside the booths!,0
Sooo many people were peeing at the black wooden-wall between the G-shops. Why didn't you place a urinal there?,0
Actually i didn't find them so bad this year... Maybe that's because I always timed my visits  and went right after they had been emptied.  ),0
tell ya one thing i don't miss is the smell of piss,0
When you know your toilets are shit  and have been for so many years  why don't you do something about it? Also  ice cold water (without soap or anything like it) isn't exactly the best for cleaning your hands after you've been to those nasty toilets..,0
I keep my home toilet like this all year to keep up that festival feeling...,0
Nickolai Brutus Nielsen  you don't think the toilet conditions have improved at all for the last many years? We're constantly working on it of course. But we are talking about an out door festival  where over a 100.000 people has to take a dump from time to time. There's only so much you can do...:-),0
Gotta love the Bajsbil,0
Thank god  I had a decent and clean toilet  the one water inside. I mean  I had a real white throne during the festival :),0
Wrong! It is a festival not a clean camping holiday at the beach!  You are supposed to get kicked out of your daily comfort zone. Otherwise  you don't get the full experience.  I look forward to next years festival - including the dirty toilets!  :-D,0
Well  the toilets are a part of the experience so - Yes  I miss the toilets as well!!,0
Did you really have to ruin my lunch like that?  FFS...,0
Are you kidding me Roskilde Admin  it was the best part  even thoyugh i was not there this year  seeing this movie made me cry for nostalgia! Yippi Kay Ye',0

I think this year they had an improvement. I didnt catch one toilet with a  top on .. And as always yes.. The lack of paper.. (I only experienced this in the P area ..  But i would like that you  spooler toiletterne  after the cleanout.. Since the toilets especially at P had a lot of puke.. On the toilets aswell.. On the floor and sides of the cabin. Thumbs up Roskilde - keep the good work! but remember there is always space for improvement.,0
I havent been there since 96´. you have now idea... lucky bstrds...,0
Best bathroom conditions ever in my 10 years of going :) Well done!,0

Funny  one of the first things I read about Andre (in 2003?) was that he was on a plane coming back from Sweden & missed the birth of his son. When I discovered your fest in 2011  I just assumed that's what he had probably gigged & was flying Home From MB NYC,0

Hey Roskilde Lovers <3  I made this video from a lot of phone recordings.. I Hope you like it :)  All the best Siona,0
I knooow... right :-)  share it if you like it  ),0
From the last Saturday  exactly as I felt it :-),0
Forhåbentlig kommer der da nogle restriktioner – ellers bliver campen fandme da snart fuldstændigt ubeboelig. Roskilde Festival admin  can you shed some light on this?,0
Yes. They will be available later on,0
Did you take a great picture at Roskilde 2012  then send it to us and enter the contest for 'best audience photo'.  Follow link for more info.,11
I did take a great picture...,0
took no pictures! i think there´s 0 proof that I even was there! those who knows knows½! see you next year  peace! we're just having fun!,0
Jonas Bøgh Pedersen  let's see it  then. Jim Boegers Nilsson fair enough - hope you had fun!,0
https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150907710301816.402933.294075001815&type=3 i will send one :),0
Alexander  thanks for sharing. However  to enter the contest you have to submit the photos. Follow the link above for more info.,0
Maybe a few  we can't say. It all depends on permissions from the artists.,0
Hey Roskilde Festival :-) Thanks for another great year. I'd like to know from someone in your post-festival-clean-up-group if the Festival has a responsibility to clean up the Maglegårdsvej bridge over the motorway  i.e. outside the festival grounds. My bike was chained to the bridge and is now missing. I have reported it stolen to the police but it would make a ton of difference to me knowing if it's most probably been removed by the festival or most probably by a thief (a very professional one carrying power tools). Thanks :-),0
So  I called instead. Turns out that was quicker. You may now (continue to) ignore this message. You're welcome :-),0
Does anyone else find the gap between Phlake and The Weeknd on Wednesday on Orange suspicious?,0
As in  you think it could be a surprise act?,0
Rage Against The Machine,0
Haha  there's nothing to be suspicious about. The so-called gap is there for production-wise reasons.,0
I find the gaps between my teeth more suspicious...,0
Selling 1 last full festival ticket with east entrance! Let me know if you´re interested!,0
Hi Amanda - I've sent you a private message :).,0
Are you interested in selling the entrance ticket only ?? (:,0
You can never be 100% safe.,0
“A couple of years ago  I started coming to the festival again  although it had been a while since I was there regularly. Now I've been here 7 times in total. I come here because of the amazing atmosphere. It's a place where you can disconnect from the rest of the world for four days. My favourite Roskilde moment is from a U2 concert in 1982  when Bono crawled to the top of the Orange stage. It was smaller back then  but it was still a really fun stunt. There are less of those spontaneous  random acts now. I guess they need to keep it more civilised. The chair is just a gimmick so my friends and I can find each other on the lawn in front of the Orange stage.” Finn  54  from Denmark  HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants! #RF15,12
Bono saw the Greenpeace whale when he was lifted up in Danish Television's crane. He sang Give Peace a Chance. I know. I was there.,0
Was the stage illuminated only by the light that shines out of Bono's arse?,0
get these guys  two for price of one  a pro skater and great musician ,0
I Hope bonobo Will Come and play!!!  See you this summer :),0
The Prodigy's around Denmark during my four favourite days of the year. Just putting it out there. Yours to take.,0
Go back to one of Apollo's great parties with Amsterdance:   http://amsterdance.pgtb.me/ddwm  Please notice that you have to like the page in order to watch it.,7
Lovin this ,0
Or just click on this link to the Youtube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ueEBTjEjLY,0
would have been great if that  mc  had shut up,0
I really liked the concept. My favorite DJ was Dennis Christopher. But Jesse Voorn and Sam O Neall also rocked the house.,0
this was craaazy. end of story,0
 I am alive  So annoying  haha!,0
Interesting. He claims himself he will be playing the Arena Stage. He would then either have to replace one of the existing acts in the schedule or guest-perform alongside one...,0
Don't feed the troll,0
Did someone ask for Outkast Official at Roskilde Festival 2014? Anyway  they’ll be here...  We also add Chance The Rapper to the line-up.  Tickets: http://bit.ly/RF14ticket ,384
More acts on friday ?,0
anyone who would have photos/videos of ©© les Freres Smith at Cosmopol stage on friday 6th  2PM  please let us know :). Thanks to everyone for such a massive good vibe!,0
Four of the curators on our brand-new East stage  announced earlier today  have received donations from Roskilde Festival Charity Foundation: Manna  TAPE  Phono Festival and (in 2016) Droz Daily Steezin. All important players on the underground scene who host and seek out leftfield musical acts and events.  The growth layer is so important for music. Besides always being on the outlook for new interesting acts for our own festival  we support initiatives doing exciting stuff in the underground.,0
Guy Grizman Did I mention the awesome charity work they do? It's non-profit  too! Get your ticket  mate!,0
Muse will be rocking Orange Stage tonight at 22.30. If you’re not lucky enough to be here at Roskilde Festival  or if you are  but have danced so hard you can’t make it down to Orange Stage  you can enjoy the concert streaming live here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/live-streaming/orange #RF15,49

Thank you! Although I'd  rather be there for real?? next year??,0
Thanks for updating about Florence. The most important performance of the whole week.,0
anyone know what time that will be for pacific coast?,0
How can you just ignore Florence? No livestream  not even a tiny little update!? It's like this huge  unbelievably great band with millions of fans  doesn't even get noticed. I didn't have the opportunity to be there  so I was kinda hoping for a little bit information about them. And as I can imagine theh propably gave the best performance you will ever hear at Roskilde based on how they did at Glastonbury. Thank you very much. Great job.,0
stream site down :-(,0
link not working,0
Your site is broken for muse :(,0
Wish I could be there! Have loved their music since I first heard them i Copenhagen in 1999. Have fun at Roskilde Festival everyone,0
It is not working :(,0
Its not working ??,0
Why you didn't stream Florence + The Machine? Nothing about the band here...I am very disappointed!,0
Would love to stream it - but the website is down. Too many viewers I guess.,0
Your website is kind of broken... sadly :(,0
Fix the fucking page!!!,0
We are experiencing a technical issue with the live streaming  but we are working hard to fix it.,0
URGENT: Can't load it??,0
It's working now. Enjoy the concert!,0
If you cant get on the main page go here. http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/roskilde-festival-2015-livestream-mit-ryan-adams-und-run-the-jewels-a-1040715.html,0
whats up with the overlays on the live stream?,0
Just to let you know  the on-screen effects ARE NOT GOOD!! Can't I just watch it normally? I get the point of it  but it doesn't work  it's cheap and crap.,0
Wow Thank you Thank you so much 4 Live streaming MUSE !!! ??????,0
First MUSE live proformace  NOW i need more!,0
What a show. When they played  Knights Of Cydonia  whole field bounced up and down. Great feeling  great crowd.,0
I was there last night - any chance I can watch it again  now that it isn't live?,0
Any good names on the way....,0
Already bought it,0
Some bm acts plz!,0
Still waiting for a couple of solid acts. While there are some good names on the banner  it's still not enough for me to buy a ticket.,0
ARe you going to have sunshine?,0
Phil Anselmo is the only decent name yet....,0
The entire program is released april 2nd.,0
Pleaseeeeee one or two leads band name and after 3 frenchy will buy their ticket  it's sure!....... It's joke  we will be there!!,0
Can you get TOOL pretty please ? <3,0
There are plenty already!,0
Leonora Cecilie Skogler  we've ordered it  so yes  -),0
So  who's playing the new East stage  you ask? Here's the rundown.  More info: roskil.de/east,33
Magnus Hinkler Gorski D.25,0
I don't see Arkis in the line-up? There must be a mistake. Arkis is the most innovative  upcoming and talented DJ of our generation. He ticks all the boxes.  Low- Budget ? No need for crowd control ? Won't be clashing with other performers  he can play at any time. ?  Arkis will do wonders for the festival.,0

Sorry for multiple posts. The page did not display the post at all.,0
Hey Roskilde Festival ! Repost my video from 2012. A clip featuring   Black Tie Swimming with an orchestra playing Star Wars  .   Much more to come in the future. Stay Tuned!,0
We add five exciting Danish acts to our line-up: Spids Nøgenhat  Bottled in England  Helhorse vs. THE PSYKE PROJECT and SLOWOLF.  That gives you acid rock  drum’n’bass  pop music and a double metal attack.  More to come... soon.,16
Finally a generally good announcement  don't know Slowolf but rest of the artists are good. That said  isn't it about time to announce headliners?,0
Great to see some Danish acts  but any chance of seeing Malrun or Surfact added to the lineup aswell?...I do feel that both bands derserve to be part of roskilde  and they are just as good if not better than whats been announced today imo,0
Roskilde iz very good,0
Helhorse vs THE PSYKE PROJECT lyder for sindssygt!,0
The Psyke Project <3,0
Would be awesome if you could get either Raunchy or Mercenary to come...,0
Helhorse is gonna scorch the grass infront of stage and set peoples hair on fire together with THE PSYKE PROJECT,0
THE PSYKE PROJECT  hell yeah!!!,0
Are you going to have an event where you release a bunch of artists  like previous years?,0
Søren Møller Nielsen  nice to see that someone's paying attention :-),0
I agree. I need at least 3-4 big headliners before I buy a ticket. Right now its not worth it.,0
Big headliners  you say? Bring Justin Bieber  Katy Perry  Britney Spears and OneDirection then! Doesn't get any bigger than that!,0
Offspring  Blink etc would do for me. Or any bands actually capable of filling orange stage.,0
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!!!,0
haha Seb  it's not 2008 anymore when that would've been relevant :D,0
My money is on Deftones,0
Or ACDC or maybe Foo Fighters or MAYBE EVEN..... RATM?!,0
Sigurd Moe Nyquist  yes - as Oliver said  it'll be 2 April.,0
Jesper Johnsen  not exactly NEW artists  huh?  -),0
Hey there  I'm wondering what the point to pay for the  get a place  add-on since i found out the camping was included in the regular ticket. In other words  what is the differences between regular camping and the  get a place ? Location is good? Warm showers?    Thanks a lot  your answer will be very helpfull to know what exactly i should pay for.,0
The Get a Place offer is aimed at groups - small and large - who want to make sure that they can camp together no matter when they arrive at the festival. We open the campsite Sunday at 18  but some people don't arrive until Wednesday and that can make it difficult to find a spot for more than one tent. But if you're just bringing one tent  getting here early  you should definitely go for the regular campsite  which is indeed included in the festival ticket. We hope that answers your question.,0
Yes  thanks a lot for the complete answer! I just have another quick question. We are two and we are now thinking of buying the  get a tent  add-on. If we buy 2 of them  is that possible to make sure to be next to each other?,0
Vincent Bonom - If you bring both the Get A Tent tickets/vouchers at the same time when you arrive you can be placed next to each other. Unless of course you are some of the very last to arrive  and there won't be two tents next to each other left.,0
Is monday early or late?,0
Monday is most likely early enough. But we can't give a 100% guarantee,0
Fair enough. I'll try it this way. Thanks a lot and see you in june!,0
Remember that special melancholia  when it's almost all over?,107
cried alittle. miss it so much :'(,0
Yeah  and the best way to get back to reality is to climb mountains. Second year in a row some of us from CAMP FRI OST did that  this year we headed to Slovakia. Beautiful transition from 11 days of Roskilde Festival and back to reality: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151264371574619.556997.823779618&type=1,0
More like sunday!,0
Roskilde Festival: Maybe you could arrange  Back to reality -get-togethers to prevent post-festival-syndrome?,0
The feeling of:  Rock'n'Roll is NOT a Lifestyle  it's a State of Mind  - Thanks for yet another great time away from the machine and all it's bullshit! :),0
Jonas Krogsbøll Nielsen  what a nice idea! But maybe that would just result in a post-festival-festival? and then there would have to be a post-festival-post festival and then....:-),0
Fantastic video. Catches the wistful feeling of leaving  still knowing you will be back.,0
Beautiful video! And the monday blues always appears..,0
Roskilde Festival: I'm pretty sure it's possible to do it non-festivalish. At least a transition from festival to reality. I would like to participate in some kind of idea development  if you want to. :) (I have some ideas..),0
I miss the song with 'Luksus' in it. Does anybody know the song?,0

Hi!  Will you have a deal like previous years with 24p beers + some tuborg garage and other beers as well?,0
ready to rumble #rf14,0
Rooooooskilde..! Få nu bare fat i System of a Down og Ty Segall!,0
If you've lost something at the festival  you should contact the police's lost and found service.,0
I'd love to know that  too.,0
Same deal.,0
Hey Amanda  the police in Roskilde suggests that I simply report it stolen. If it turns up in lost and found they'll contact you. Reporting it does require the Vehicle Identification Number (stelnummer). I'd love to know if you find out other things.,0
annoying.. Since all the bikes were suddenly gone  I was hoping that the Festival had moved them somewhere and it wasn't stolen. Mine is a Long John (with a children-seat on the back)  so I will probably not see it again.,0
Roskilde Festival  I'd like to know from someone in your clean-up-group if the Festival has a responsibility to clean up the Maglegårdsvej bridge over the motorway  i.e. outside the festival grounds. This is where my bike is now missing.,0
Hey Amanda  I called the police and I called Roskilde festival. The police haven't removed any bikes and Roskilde affirmed that they don't clear any areas outside the actual festival grounds. If  like me  you parked outside the fences behind Orange chances are now slim... I found a small piece of my bike lock on the street right where I parked  so I'm now reporting it stolen . Hope you have insurance.,0
Can we be sure  that the security is at highest during this years festival? I'm heartbroken and a bit stunned with fear after the devastating news about Manchester last night  making it a little bit difficult to look forward to this years festival. I hate to admit it but it does.,0
Hi Sheila Security is of course a very important focus for us. We spend a lot of time with the local police preparing and making sure that our security measures are up to date.,0
The objective of terrorism  foreign and domestic  is to instill a fear in the population or a certain demographic  to push for or discourage from a political agenda  even if it comes in the guise of personal  religious or sociological conviction.   The fear is the objective  the fear that drives the change they wish for. The bodycount is a non-essential parameter  only relevant in that it is a factor in heightening the fear. For example  the assassination of one head of state would likely provoke more fear than the assassination of 5 elderly citizens.   Our weapon against terrorism must  then  fight the fear and not over-focus on the security. By all means  we need security  we need safety  and we need to FEEL safe  but more than that  we need to show the staunchness to oppose the political views the terrorism is meant to turn us toward. Oppose mindless  biased persecution of islam and muslims  privatizing armies  militias and policing  overinvestment in war material  research funding non-sustainable and ecologically damaging subjects  and production of the same.  By being subjected to terrorist acts  we become targets  even hit targets. Only by reacting in the way they intended us to react  we become victims.,0

Nicholas Taylor you ok mate,0
A new week brings new Roskilde Festival announcements. Here's what's going down tomorrow. You know the drill.,8
THE PSYKE PROJECT! (album Guillotine + 10k likes),0
The headless italian?,0
100% Rage Against The Machine!!,0
I am lost for ideas. But people are probably going to guess it in 5min,0
t-pain,0
sMØlf = MØ! :D,0
when are the big names coming? or are they coming at all?,0
RATM \m/,0
Since none of the bands have more than 10K likes  it's futile for me to guess  since I probably haven't heard about any of them. Hopefully they will have real names on friday.,0
Bottled in England  The Psyke Project  Helhorse  Spidsnøgenhat og måske Slowolf.,0
S__LF = slowolf = wolf = wolf gang = tyler the creator = Tyra the creator = tyra banks,0
pleeeaseeeee invite GRIMES to RF14! She is amazing!!!!,0
Looks like little more waiting time for next big names,0
I'm still hoping that Kings of Leon will be announced... It would fit in their current tour dates and locations ??,0
Please a famous act this time.,0
Wow! - bottled in England! :D,0
Tankard  then on to Cattle Decapitation.. the S__lf and the tea-pot .. i ahve no idea.,0
the bottom right only means that there will be 4k seriously flying potheads @  Roskilde Festival come July :),0
Wow  that didn’t take long!  We sort of thought that you’d get the most of these  but not THAT fast. Seriously people  we’re talking five minutes! Does this mean that the teaser was much too easy  or are you just getting too good at this game?  Props to Andreas Ackermann and @Kaylee Kaylee Wesley Pearson (same time stamp) for guessing Bottled in England first  Alexander Kolby (so we meet again!) for guessing The Psyke Project first  @Thomas Thomas Bjerregaard Bonde and @Andreas Andreas Geday Overgaard (same time stamp - again!) for guessing Helhorse first  Peter Andersen for guessing Spids Nøgenhat first  and @Tobias Tobias Lindhardt Iversen for guessing Slowolf first.  Here’s a run-down of the logic behind it all (from the top left and clockwise):  Bottled in England was represented by a couple of… you guessed it… bottles.  THE PSYKE PROJECT and Helhorse play on the same stage with/against each other. The Psyke Project is represented by a good old guillotine  which is also the title of their latest album. For Helhorse we chose the Ferrari logo  which includes a black stallion.  If you’ve visited SLOWOLF's Facebook or Soundcloud page  you’ll see that he’s written his name using just consonants on a couple of track covers. We copied that – and left out a few letters – Wheel of Fortune-style – in an attempt to confuse you. That didn’t work!  Spids Nøgenhat's debut album is called “En mærkelig kop te”  which translates to ‘a strange cup of tea’. The band is here represented by a somewhat strange teapot.,0
With maybe Helhorse as the + 2k?,0
Could be so fucking awesome!,0
THE PSYKE PROJECT  Helhorse  Spids Nøgenhat - upcoming bands? Hah. These will all be actual festival bands  mark my words.,0
(y),0
And not for the up-and-coming stage either  ),0
Gonna rule! Have NO idea how they are going to pull this  vs  thing off.. But sounds exciting,0

I wonder that as well. This year is the worst lineup Ive ever seen at Roskilde.,0
They also do not tour this year.,0
sadly no :(,0
Can't you guys go mope somewhere else? ,0
Thats what they say.. BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE! <3,0
Give us some chili peppers instead!,0

Nothside bookeren sagde det bedst........You can't book a band that's NOT ON TOUR!,0
anyway I don't really think it :(,0
Haha its the same cycle every year: 1) So curious to what they announce. Please please my favourite band. 2) OMG where's the big names  worst lin-up ever. Won't come. Hate Roskilde 3.) (If sold out) Shit shit shit. Who sells a ticket? 4. OMG all these nice bands I want to see is playing at the same time. 5) Best week of my life  so drunk  so fun  see you next year. Restart cycle... Please stop bithing  listen to the musick  buy your ticket  let's party and watch awesome music...,0
Tyra Banks = Banksy = Lloyd Banks = Rage Against The Machine. Bulletproof!,0
Jonathan - don't forget people complaining that the lineup was SO much better the year before xD,0
True  i hate when people are bitching. The Lineup is not ready and i can not wait.,0
I wouldn't mind the THE PSYKE PROJECT playing!,0

But they really behind presenting big names compared to previous years.,0
ITT: People with heads approx. 5 metres below the joke.,0
The Stones have played many places in Denmark  but never the Roskilde Festival. In 2006 they played in Horsens  and previously often in Copenhagen. Someone wrote that the Stones in 2014 were looking for new places to play on this year´s tour  places never played before. Roskilde Festival fits that bill. From http://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1 1983663 1991271  Let s get these Legends to play Roskilde Festival :),0
Selling 4 tickets to Roskidle festival.  The Full Festival ticket is your access to 8 days of Roskilde Festival. Regular camping included in the ticket.  I have 4 tickets i buy it for my family but i we can`t go...! PM please. If you take all 4 i gave the best price. PM ,0

Jørgen  sorry  it's sold out and won't be back in stock.,0
What a shame  I really liked the cap and I guess everyone else did to  since it was sold out at every merchandise stand during the festival.,0
Thank U for a great show COPENHEAVY made Roskilde Festival Apollo stage  to something different...,0
It's been 24 hours since we opened the festival site. Spiderman aka Alex was the first one to reach Orange stage  and he celebrated in style with the canopy crew and his competitors in the queue. Which concert has been your biggest celebration so far? #RF15,7

Hi guys! Please take a minute (seriously  a minute. one. 1.) to complete this 5-question survey. It would mean the world to me and my collagues. We're business & design students from an international university (TEKO) in Denmark and doing a phone application for festival guests for our project.   Thank you in advance! :)  ,0
Check out the latest news article on our website  and you'll find what you're looking for,0
The fun was ruined for me at this year's festival when my beautiful Russian officer hat was stolen from me. I am grateful though to all the people who were willing to help me look for it  without result unfortunately. And to the guy that stole it: I hope your conscience is stinging every time you look at the hat you took from someone who loved it. Doing such a mean thing is what makes you a person that don't belong at a festival. Shame on you!,0
Roskilde first timer here. I'm wondering about accommodations. I'd like to book a hotel in Copenhagen  but want to make sure I can get home late night. Can someone let me know if it's possible? Thanks.,0
Hi Joann   Welcome to your first Roskilde! It is definitely possible to take the trip back and forth between Copenhagen and Roskilde almost around the clock. You can use Rejseplanen.dk to check the regular train schedule between Roskilde Station and Copenhagen Central Station. Or you can take the night bus from the Roskilde Festival camping East entrance. Schedule is here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?transport=train night-bus-to-copenhagen  Transit is about 25 minutes by train  a bit longer by bus.  I do  however  if you're not too luxury-minded  recommend staying on the camping site instead. It's also cheaper  since all you need is your own tent  which costs about the same as one night in an average Copenhagen hotel.   There are also loads of things going on during the festival's 8 days  that one might miss out on  if you're taking the expensive route and are staying in Copenhagen instead  but I can definitely see the benefits of getting a good nights sleep in a hotel as well.   Have a good one.,0
JOE 'SHREDLORD' STUMP Talks New EXORCISM Album 'I AM GOD'! ,0
I need to figure out how to perform here,0
I heard some days agao the poster will out on april 2. I can not wait  :),0
Remember this advice...,0
Selling 1 last full festival ticket with east entrance! Let me know if you´re interested!,0
Anybody with a spare  tent central  ticket? :),0
It's a article from 2001 which for some odd reason keeps popping up. So the concert was 13 years ago.,0
Thank You..,0
the best,0
It's quite simple. If you have a Get A Tent add-on ticket  you don't need entrance booking.,0
I believe I wrote this a year or two ago as well: Real Estate  seriously.,0
Time for some kawaii music at Roskilde? Book Metalbaby and you can keep metalheads  Nipponophiles  schoolkids and indie hipsters all happy with just one act! What's not to like?,0
What kind of music will we get this week ?,0
Different kinds of music. You'll know when you see it.,0
It's 210 x 210 cm so that depends on how big you are  ) but usually it should be no problem. And Get A Tent does not require a special wristband  so you can easily bring a friend,0
In case you missed it this weekend  a new clip was posted featuring Black Tie Swimming with an orchestra playing Star Wars :)  Enjoy.. much more to come in the future. Stay tuned :),0
Nope. It says on the ticket that it is only refundable if the whole event is cancelled.,0
A Tribe Called Quest are forced to cancel their show at Roskilde 2017. Instead  legendary rapper Ice Cube steps in. He will play Saturday 1 July. We can also announce Digable Planets who will bring jazzy hip-hop to Roskilde.  The reason for the cancellation is that front man Q-Tip recently had a shoulder injury and needs surgery after which his doctor has ordered him to stay home and rest.,436

Hey Roskilde Festival  when does the camping site open this year? I remember it was on saturday last year  but I read on the website it's sunday at 18:00 now?,0
Right  as Peter Juhl Nielsen says it's Sunday at 18.,0
Ah  that totally sucks :P The only overnight train from Amsterdam arrives at saturday 9:00. Thanks for the quick answer!,0
Add-ons are now available at BILLETnet  Buy a pitched tent  a reserved place for your camp  a Tenthouse  a Rockwool Shelter and more:,9
no it's not...,0
One question. Is the GAT Central fee (770 DKK) for 2 persons or 1?,0
Does one Central ticket provide access to the Central area for two people (like Uptown last year)?,0
There aren't anywhere with improved shower and toilet facilities?,0
How do i reserve a place for my camp?,0
Did Get-a-Place sell out last year?,0
How many tickets/tents are availabe at GAT Central?,0
Hi. Is there no uptown camping this year?,0
Hi! How many sleeping units are GAT Small  Medium  Large and X-Large divided in? Last year Large had two units  each with room for two people.,0
Are rock wool and tent house roughly the same size?? We're coming from aus and will have luggage which do u recommend ??,0
Do the Rockwell cabins have a mattress/bed in them?,0
Will there be any Tuborg vouchers for this years festival?,0
Can anybody just walk into the Get A Tent areas  or do you need to be accompanied with someone who live there?,0
Have just bought my ticket/Rockwool shelter. Are warm showers included or do we have to buy that as an ekstra as well?,0
If I buy add-on-tickets for 2-3 medium size tents at GAT east  can I be sure that the tents are placed close to each other?,0
What kind of material are the mattress in the tenthouse ?,0
Question on Get A Place 10x10: How are the areas placed? Could you risk getting a spot in the middle of a square and not by the walkways? Do you have to queue at the entrance to get a good 10x10 spot or is it appointed in advance?  Looking forward to an awesome festival :),0
What kind of electricity is provided in the tenthouse ?,0
Hey guys  will there be any news regarding Get A Camp anytime soon? It was on the website before  but now it's gone....,0
Could you help me point out payment-showers/payment-toilet locations on the map...,0
Any news on the details?,0
Please try again. Is it still not open?,0
Malenae Hertz is it still not available? Should be working,0
Yes  now it worked :-),0
Peter Larsen that is for one tent. So it's up to you if you wanna be one or two persons in that tent,0
Access to the central area is not limited. Everybody with a festival band can visit the area  so you can stay two people with one Get A Tent,0
Anton Demant Olin - Through Get A Place: http://www.billetnet.dk/event/get-a-place-Tickets/379205,0
There are showers in the area but it is not included in the Get A Tent ticket,0
Ok  Thanks! So you are not offering Camping Areas which includes showers and foodtickets  like last year?,0
Yes it did,0
No not this year,0
There are regular showers and toilet facilities at all the camping areas. There are no special improved showers or toilets,0
Thank you :),0
We can't give you an exact number  but it isn't a huge area so they are limited,0
Yes you can. You will get a voucher to place in your front window and you can leave and come back any time,0
Marie Louise Margrethe Jørgensen - Get A Tent Central will not be a walk-through area. The asphalt road divides the Get A Tent Central area and the Festival site so there is no reason to go through the GAT central area unless you are living there or visiting friends,0
You mention that there are showers in the area... for both M and Central? Or only M?,0
No uptown camping. But lots of opportunities for central camping or a bit more luxurious stay at the festival,0
Kenneth Herlin There will be showers in every camping area. Central included,0
I'm very sad to hear that!,0
All of them have only one room,0
That depends on your size and how close you wanna sleep  ) Small is 210 x 210 cm and medium is 490 x 220 cm,0
Kasper Toftkær Hansen - Get a Tent is only available at M and Central. Take a look at the map here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf,0
There are no mattress or bed in the Rockwool Shelters,0
Kenneth Perry - Rockwool Shelters are a bit bigger and taller. They are 4 m2 and 2 m high with a porch as well. Both have space for two people and luggage. You can compare here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/tenthouse/ and http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/rockwool_shelter/,0
If all the sizes have only one room  also the X-Large with space for 12 people  is it a nylon floor covering the whole tent?,0
Yes.The X-Large tent is made of regular tent material. No special floor as such. But of course it is made of high quality material fit for many people in one room,0
R.I.P. Uptown. Maybe this gives H&M an opportunity to come back next year so we can get things up to standard again. *drops coin in wishing well*,0
But on your website it says: (Get a tent Central) This area opens Wednesday 2 July and is only available through purchase of a Get A Tent Central ticket.???,0
What they mean is you need to buy a get a tent ticket to get a tent.,0
or 3 or 4 but it will be a very tight fit lol,0
Daniel - They will be available later on,0
Kenneth - The tents will be distributed as people arrive. The specific details are not ready yet,0
Than sounds fair :-),0
Roskilde Festival  will there be anyone monitoring and checking entrance bands to this site  as per the GAT other years ?,0
Paul Burgess - No. Access to the GAT areas are not limited  so a regular festival band will give you access to the area. In that way you can have friends over. But as we said the GAT areas are not walk-through areas. Have a look  at the map if you'd like: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf,0
Conny Hallberg - We don't know yet. But they should be quite comfortable,0
There is no limit to have many tents you can have inside a get a place area as long as they can fit of course,0
Christine Hardt - There will be no reboot camp. We'll fix that page right away,0
Neil Mills - Warm showers are not included,0
Jacob Bæhr Mortensen - No. But if you arrive with all 2 or 3 vouchers at the same time we will make sure to place you next to each other,0
Lasse Søndergaard - No. These are very expensive luxury tents  so that is not possible,0
Mikkel - Anybody can walk into the areas. But they are not walk-through areas  so there is no reason to do so unless you are visiting friends. Have a look at the map if you'd like: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf,0
Thanks Roskilde Festival  so this basically means that the area is subject to possible theft?  Lets hope you have security that watch out for the thieves that frequent festivals. Looking fwd to the nice atmosphere of Roskilde Festival anyway:-),0
Jacob Bæhr Mortensen - Sorry. Vouchers is what we call all tickets for add-ons. So if you arrive with all tickets/vouchers for GATs you will be placed next to each other. Unless of course you are among the very last ones to arrive and there might not be 2 or 3 places next to each other left.,0
Thank you very much for that answer!,0
Paul Burgess - Yes. Like any other camping area theft is a risk unfortunately. But there will be security of course,0
Niklas Birksted - Get A Camp has been replaced by Get A Tent X-Large: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent/,0
Kasper Nagel Nielsen - That's not ready yet  sorry.,0
Jonas Rank Møller - We are still working on the details regarding distribution of places. Hopefully we can have an answer for you within a few days,0
Jonathan Kjær Jensen - We are still working on the details regarding distribution of places. Hopefully we can have an answer for you within a few days,0
Jonathan Kjær Jensen - Not yet. But we haven't forgotten about you. We're working on it,0
Are you still working on it? We are looking forward to hear these details as well!!!!!!,0
Hello Roskilde Festival. I am going to try and get the tent area 100 metres from the orange stage  which goes on sale today at 10.00. I have looked on your front page and can not find the details  will a direct link to the booking of this area  be placed on your front page ?. If not  then can you advise me of where it is where the booking can be made. Thanks:-),0
Thanks Roskilde Festival  have just booked my tent 100 metres from orange stage:-),0

We're deeply saddened to hear about the sudden passing of Chris Cornell.   He played Roskilde Festival with both Soundgarden in 1990 and Audioslave in 2005.   Rest in peace.   Photo: Rockphoto (Audioslave at Roskilde Festival 2005),105

Hello ?? Looking for one  or preferably two legitimate one-day tickets for friday. Please pm if you can help me out! Greatly appreciated  thanks ??,0
Selling 1x full festival(8 days) ticket to Roskilde Festival for 2000 - NOK. Originally bought for 2200 NOK. Also selling a 'Oslo roadtrip' ticket for 800 - NOK. Also selling a 24pack Tuborg beer ticket for 130 - NOK. Price is final - no haggle.,0
Selling a full festival ticket  and also a 24pack tuborg beer coupon. PM,0
202A towards Musicon stops right next to Roskilde Handelsskole.,0
No promises - only the quarter finals are played during RF14.,0
Earlier today we announced Kasabian as part of our 2014 line-up. Here's a taste of things to come…  (skip to 4:21 to go directly to the concert),10
Jeppe Damgaard Leth wuuuh :D,0
Why skip to 421 when 420 would be so much funnier??  D,0
Rolling Stones are maybe going to play these festivals TW Classic 2014 and Pinkpop. I hope Roskilde Festival is also talking to The Stones :),0
Is Roskilde Really the worlds 2nd biggest ?,0
I was pretty sure that Sziget beat it  but apparently not.,0
WHAT !! No hell no.. Sziget is cool.. but not big,0
The depends on how you count. We have about 75 000 paying audience members each day. Thursday-Sunday we have approx. 5 000 additional one-day ticket holders. On top of that we have about 30 000 volunteers throughout the week and a couple of thousands media representatives and other representatives form the industry.,0
Blimey!  Fact: We spend DKK 8 million on waste management every year - money we'd much rather spend on real art.,8
Why not make trash returnable like pant on cans? Take total amount you use on campsite clean up each year  divide by kg of garbage  and then you have your price per returned kilogram.   I'll guarantee campsite cleaner than ever as a result - think about how few empty cans there are!,0
Remember they did that with beers instead of cash a few years back? I imagine doing cash would be waaay more complicated.,0
And I guarantee you trailers of garbage arriving at roskilde. And no more stones at camp area's.,0
Just prevent bringing in trash at the gates - should look pretty obvious - and sort the garbage before payment.,0
How do you propose you handle taxes? You can't just randomly give out money to people :) the refund system is already in place. Nothing similar to my knowledge that would sort this.,0
There are probably solutions for that  which Roskilde can figure out :-). They are just buying from private individuals.,0
For your information  in one single camp square  of which we have 400  we found approx. 1000 empty cans and 80 kilos of unopened beers/sodas.,0
instead of handing people money for collecting trash  you could get food tickets drink tickets or something useful for guest. Something like this should be nessrary people should just clean their shit up  maybe by creating more advertising for climate change ect would work  to open the eyes for people what our trash actually harms the environment,0
Petteri Pertola  If you think that you can prevent thrash at the gates  then you probably never have attended the festival. People are bringing in tons of shit.,0
Been there 11 times mate. It's fairly obvious if you are bringing a trailer full of trash.,0
Hahaha :D bellissimo,0
I've got two day tickets for the Friday available at face value. Sadly not needed now.,0
Hi  im interested  but since there is so many fake tickets around  could you send me a pic of the receit and your info in a personal message?,0
Hope its ok with you?? anyway send me a pm so we can make a deal??,0
I've sent you a message ????,0
Sorry but they're sold now.,0
How do I find out which bands are playing when?,0
Are you selling one ticket  and where can it be picked up  Billy? :),0
I have them as PDFs :) I would prefer to sell them both but if no one else wants both of them you can buy one later today?,0
Let me know as soon as possible! :) I'll see if I can find a friend! Are you not going anyway?,0
Unfortunately I won't be going at all :( I'll let you know in an hour or two!,0
Are you selling them for 1050 pr. ticket = 2100 total? :),0
I will buy both  i will write you a personal message now  check your 'other' inbox :),0
Kasabian’s very first Danish gig was at Roskilde Festival. Now they’re are back for more at Roskilde 2014.  So is metal legend Phil Anselmo (of Pantera fame) who’s playing under his own name.  Other additions: The Men  Bl'ast  Rumble In Rhodos,30
Fuck yeah Philip H. Anselmo & the Illegals!!!,0
Solomon Miller Nordin Belkacemi ! kasabian :D,0
When are the big cannons being announced?,0
And remember  Phil Anselmo is touring with 3-4 Pantera songs. Will be sooo amazing.!!!! http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/philip-h-anselmo-and-the-illegals/2014/trees-dallas-tx-4bc5d73a.html,0
Yeeeees! Thank you  Roskilde  now I love you even more :),0
I hope you provide sound sound for them this time  otherwise they may not be back a third time,0
Daniel! Phil kommer! :D,0
Which stage will Phillip Anselmo & The Illegals be playing on?,0
Thank you Roskilde for Phil Anselmo. Now we have acts i m really looking forward to see and they are Rob Zombie  Phil Anselmo and Damon Albarn :),0
more rock n roll bands pls,0
Yeah Motherfuck  I am so looking forward to Roskilde now!!!!,0
Samuel Strafford kasabian and the men!,0
JAAAA FEDT!!! Phil Anselmo and the illegals!!!,0
Remember Kasabian from 2010 and it was the one of the best shows that year! Had the most chillaxing afternoon just sitting back listening to them play and I didn't know them back then so I was a fan after that! But still aint buying tickets... The acts so far haven't been convincing me to go this year :),0
no dude Phil Anselmo,0
Ah  there you are  Daniel. We missed you.,0
haha still alive :o),0
Michael Panduro  yeah  something went wrong. Facebook's terrible when pages try to like other pages. We mean these guys  of course: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_(punk_band),0
Bastian Reinholdt Madsen  too early to say. You'll know more in June.,0
Caspar Christiansen  sorry - didn't mean to bring false hope (or maybe we have as people we hoping for the other The Men. You never know  right?),0
I wouldn't put it past you :) Hope no one got disappointed with the correction! I good  since you already booked Future of The Left  so now im just being gready.,0
Jakob Philip Jørgensen  no more acts today.,0
Ohh the wrong link just broke my heart  good to know this puuha,0
They're not touring  so that makes things complicated...,0
No....,0
Tom Morello is touring with Bruce Springsteen and Im not even sure if RATM still exists. They seem to be on hold for now though.,0
Same steps as the first time. Click 'Flexpay' through our site and log in with the profile you've starting paying with. The ticket is mailed as soon as the 10 portions are paid.,0
Here's a thorough Q&A if you're still in doubt: http://www.billetnet.dk/event/event-Billetter/ROFFLEXP?language=en-us&brand=dk_rf,0
Hi Roskilde Festival!  I was just wondering when you're announcing James Vincent McMorrow?  Best regards and thanks in advance,0
Not this year. You can be pretty sure of that since NorthSide Festival grabbed him instead.,0
Yeah.. And have you completely forgotten about star mix and salt bombs ????,0
In the words of greased up deaf guy  See ya yall next yearhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaGPJ67jA6A,0
My nomination for the videomarathon music video-contest. Are you in it?,0
Hey Roskilde! Could you please clarify  is clean out loud entire area C this year  or only the bottom part of it? - cheers!,0
That map has an error in it. The line as well as the CLEAN OUT LOUD text is not supposed to be there. If I am not mistaken  COL is only in area E this year.,0
Roskildes website says bottom of c as well?,0
Yesterday we announced King Ayisoba and Jupiter & Okwess International. How would you describe their music? Choose one and put it in one sentence.  The two best answers win tickets to either King Ayisoba’s or Jupiter & Okwess International’s shows at Global Copenhagen on 14 March and 28 March respectively. We’ll choose the winners tomorrow at 14:00.,2
Anders Østerlund Larsen - You won two tickets for Jupiter & Okwess International at Global Copenhagen 28 march. Please send a mail to kasper.arildskov@roskilde-festival.dk and we'll sort out the details.,0
I already sent a email  maybe it went in the spam folder but I'll try again :-D,0
Phil Anselmo & the Illegals!,0
Could be awesome if that is true :),0
It's Phil Anselmo speaking on the clip. Don't know which band he's bringing  but it's definitely him.,0
http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/down-to-release-new-ep-down-iv-part-two-in-may/ maybe Down,0
Either way it will be AWESOME!! Phucking Phil!,0
Want to sleep 100 metres from the Orange Stage? Want to arrive to an already pitched tent? Want to camp with a bit more luxury?  On Monday at 10:00 we’ll open for sale of add-ons.  This is the preliminary festival map,81
AddOns are nice  but I would rather know how entrance saturday is planned.,0
Jippi I want to camp 100 meters from the Orange stage yes!!!!!!!!!Like last year. Is it at the  same spot? Hundeklubben?,0
Do you still have Get A Camp? (a big tent  in other words :P),0
Roskilde Festival Will there be direct access from the GATs to the festival area or will walking to one of the classic gates be required?,0
Will you also open for caravan camping on Monday?,0
But the central get a tent area means that the festival area will be smaller. Couldn't it be a problem to get room for all the people on a smaller area. Especially since the Odeon area was always full of people?,0
Just a quick question. Where is the Handi-Camp this year?,0
Is the area south of Agora E open for camping this year?,0
Omg just seeing the map almost brought a tear to my eye.. Last year was so awesome. I wanna go so bad this year but I'm a student now so I might not make it :(,0
If we buy Get A Place  how is this estimated? I mean  is it measured in m3 or in how many tents there are room for?,0
will the grass be ready this time so we dont have to stay all the way up northwest like last year  disconnected from everything?,0
Will GAT East be a closed area as in  Access with special wristband only ?,0
Can I buy My festival ticket and add on in the same purchase on monday?,0
What day does the Get-a-tent camps open for the public?,0
So there will be no GAT Downtown in the west this year? North of B and the motorway like last year?,0
We're working on it,0
Every camping area has its advantages and disadvantages. We try to accommodate everybody's wishes,0
Vibeke Beck  plus it's Sunday  not Saturday.,0
We have tents for up to 12 people at Get A Tent East,0
This is a new spot. In the area where the former stage Odeon was,0
That's the new Rising stage where upcoming bands will play during the first days of the festival :),0
Nice! :D,0
No the old Odeon stage area.,0
Anders is right. There will be no Get A Tent Uptown where it was last year Rasmus. Get A Tent Central is new and if you want more luxury we have Tenthouses and Rockwool Shelters at Get A Tent East,0
what? it's sunday? but you always open on saturday? :o and for the ones of us who already bought a ticket  how do we get an entrance?,0
Kasper Get A Tent Central has direct access to the festival area. Get A Tent East does not have direct access but it is right nearby the entrance at Arena,0
Wait.. so no more rising on the junior stage?,0
Would that mean that the stampede after concerts on Orange also has free entrance to GAT Central?,0
This year we'll open on Sunday instead of Saturday. As to your question of entrance - if you have a ticket you can get in  no changes here,0
Emma but the entrance will open Sunday at 18:00,0
IMHO the latter years entrance-booking saturday worked really well. My hope is that whatever new approach you take  it will combine the need of an effortless-ish waiting and taking care of the me-me-me idiots.,0
Another question. Can we still pinch up a party-tent?,0
Susanne - Not tommorow but on monday  ) Tenthouses are luxury tents placed on a fixed bottom above ground. They include electricity and light  a 135 x 200 cm matress  a lockable storage box and space for luggage. Rockwool Shelters is an octagonal shelter  built of rock wool insulation. The material makes it suitable for festival nights because it protects against heat  cold  water and sound. Prices and more information will be available on Monday.,0
Not at Get A Tent. But with Get A Place you can reserve a place for you camp  but then you will have to bring your own tents,0
Pavillion Junior is no more. The Rising Stage will have all the rising acts that were formerly at Pavillion Junior and Apollo Countdown will have the more electronic acts,0
Herman Killingmoe yes  caravan camping will also  be available for purchase on monday,0
Will we have to stand in line and use the same entrance as the rest if we order Get A Place? Or if we buy Get A Tent  do we have to be there at sunday  or can we come a day later? Many questions. I just haven't made up my mind on where to be :),0
Nadja - You can buy add-ons on monday whether you have a ticket or not. But come festival time you will need a regular festival ticket to get in,0
Rikke - We  can't say the prices yet. But all the information will be available on monday,0
Andreas - The prices will be available on Monday,0
Of course :) When will the Get a Tent areas open?,0
Marita - You can come whenever you like if you buy Get A Tent or Get A Place. It is reserved for you. Get A Tent Central  however  will first open on Wednesday 2 July at 12:00,0
Get A Tent East will open Sunday at 18:00 like the regular camping areas. Get A Tent Central will open Wednesday 2 July at 12:00,0
In my humnle opinion  that's bullshit. But i seem to be one of the few who thinks this.. so i guess i gotta accept,0
Allan - Yes you can,0
Christian -  Every year we make a security assessment of the festival. And don't worry  there will be enough room for everybody in the festival area,0
Unfortunately it is not possible to reserve a place in the camping area. However  P is a large area and there should be plenty of space if you arrive in time. You can reserve a place in the M area with Get A Place but not for 100 people though,0
has it Been decided where the sleep in bus camp will be?,0
Yes Morten. M will be both regular Get A Tents and more luxurious Tenthouses and Rockwool Shelters,0
Patrick Hand-Camp will be at the same place as last year,0
Bjørn - Here's the full map: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf Sleep-in busses are right next to Entrance West,0
Cool! Do you happen to have the prize for the tent for 6 people? Can't seem to find it anywhere. Thanks for answering all these questions!,0
You'll know more on Monday.,0
(Y),0
Hans Offersen  read more about it all here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/roskilde-festival-2014-starts-here/,0
Johan Aldén  money issue or exam issue?,0
Nanna Amstrup  thanks for pointing that link out. It's 2013 info and doesn't count for 2014.,0
A bit of both actually. I only have distance courses during the summer so i could probably take some time off but student loans don´t leave too much room for travel and stuff. I´ll do my best though! :),0
Kristian Møller  why is it bullshit? The content is the same. Now we've just given the upcoming music it's own stage.,0
Anders Cold  whatever's dark green is camping areas (the map does change some along the way  but that's how it currently looks),0
Mads Steenstrup Hannibal  nope. Everyone with a regular festival wristband has access so it is possible to invite guests into the area. You can also share your tent with others (some might be interested in that).,0
Daniel Karlsson  yes  absolutely. We know it wasn't exactly a favour to move you guys last year.,0
Doh. Will GAT Central be a closed area as in  Access with special wristband only ?,0
Mads Steenstrup Hannibal  just to understand you correctly: do you prefer it to be closed?,0
Actually  yes. I rather enjoyed the Get A Tent Uptown at Berendsen's ground the last couple of years. Not that we had big ass guards securing the premises but at least you felt safe from people raving through the tents. Call me old-fashioned  hey  call me old as well. I just felt that it was an extra service well worth paying extra for. Reconcider this for next year  please.,0
Agree with Mads above. GAT uptown was also good option for those of us who paid our dues and enjoyed 20 years in the regular camp and would now like an area where it's reasonablyconvenient  clean  safe and with better bath room facilities. So a shame to lose this.,0
Maria Schultz Drewsen  don't expect parking right next to Get A Tent Central. We have parking areas at west and east (and maybe to the south). If you want to park up close  you have to buy a parking ticket (also an add-on ticket)  but we also have free parking areas located further away.,0
Vivi Korn  you don't get specific tents when buying your add-on ticket. You get the tents when you arrive at the area. So if you arrive fairly early and together  you will get three tents next to each other.,0
Jon Bolstad. that's right. We know it wasn't exactly 'downtown' - and the location is much better this time around.,0
Bjarne Magne  East opens at the same time as the regular campsite  Sunday at 18:00. Central doesn't open until Wednesday.,0
Alexandra Donelli Lidén  you probably already found an answer for this - but yes.,0
Yes I did :) Thanks anyway!,0
Check it out guys!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zjQqA4IQj4&feature=plcp,0
Hey! I have East-entrance  but I would really love South. If you wanna switch  hit me up on PM! xx,0
Can you message me please :),0
We alway do ),0

HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants! #RF15   We're from the town of Roskilde and coming to the festival has been an important part of our grown up years. Mads has been coming to the festival since 1977 and i'm a little younger so i've attended since 1982. Now our children also come out here. Our son is nearby  closer to the stage right now. We're going to spy on him a bit but he won't notice us.  Karen (50) + Mads (52),6
It's not possible to vote in the video marathon? There's no buttons on the site...,0
Can you keep up with Lil Uzi Vert? He has been called the future of rap and got his name by rapping as fast as a little uzi gun.  Lil Uzi Vert is a true fireball on stage  and if you don't believe us... Just watch the clip.  Explore #RF17 and get to know the wild Lil Uzi Vert in 60 seconds.,17
Sille Kongedam :D :D :D,0
How can this be the future if it sounds exactly like the rest of the rappers doing this shit nowadays? (future  migos and all that crap that I wouldn't even call hip hop). Same beat  same beatrepeats on the hihats  same phrasing  same lack of creativity for lyrics. I want to believe there is hope for music  but sometimes people like this make it so hard man.,0
Irmelin Skogvold miss him...,0
Julie Mølgaard Sivertsen :D,0
If this is the future of rap... Damn  I dont even know what to say. Biggie would turn over in his grave....,0

Hi everyone!  This could be of interest to any of you that are planning to go to Roskilde Festival this summer:  billionBricks designs and provides shelter and infrastructure solutions for the homeless and vulnerable. WeatherHYDE  one of our solutions  is an emergency life-saving shelter  designed to protect the urban homeless from extreme weather. The WeatherHYDE social media campaign went viral in 2016 with 40 million media hits and Ashton Kutcher calling it 'innovation at its finest’. This opened new avenues where families buying camping gear have expressed interest to purchase it for themselves  which has given birth to a new purpose driven model of buy one and gift one. So on weatherhyde.org anyone can buy it  gift it  or do both  with every tent helping the homeless.  With the WeatherHYDE Wayfarer campaign  we are now looking to spread the word about the WeatherHYDE tent so that even more homeless can be provided with protection and survive extreme weather. We are looking for groups of 3 people or more to travel with (for ex. to a festival) and create a hype around the WeatherHYDE tent and to share their experience on social media  with a chance of winning up to $1000! The deadline is the 14th of May. Check out https://weatherhyde.org/bb-wayfarers/ for details.,0
City and Colour. Make it happen. ,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6uWhLcDcj4 Please bring Apollo to Roskilde again next year!!! :D,0
Our Rising Stage hosts some of the finest upcoming musicians. Artists on their way towards greatness. Looking back just a few years  we've seen artists such as MØ  The Minds of 99 and Phlake start out on the upcoming stage and become massive stars  afterwards playing our biggest stages.   Check out the line-up on the Rising Stage 2017 and listen to the stars of tomorrow: roskil.de/RisingPlaylist,13
 Gender is over !  Besides being an advocate for the trans community  lead vocalist Laura Grace Jane and the rest of this raging badass punk rock band will knock your socks off on Friday 30 June.  Explore #RF17 and get to know Against Me! in 60 seconds.,4
 Gender is over  but then you feel the need to put a person into binary gender boxes first the male gender and then into the woman gender.  It would also be nice if you could ban and delete people from writting Transphobic comments.,0
No  she has always been a woman. Even when not presenting as one.. and could you skip talking about gender as binary. And deal with the transphobia in the comments.,0
Harald Schroll Bjørnsbo Jonathan Hjalte Ravnskov Mathias Remming Wester there are more than 2 genders ????????,0
Changing your gender is impossible. Test his DNA and we can see if he's still a man or a woman :),0
A wonderful band!,0
Ban people I don't agree with!! I'm so tolerant!,0
Gabriel Bagley there is a big difference in having a discussion where you dont necessarily agree  but you can still speak in a way that respects each other  (which is a very important thing to have) and writting straight up hatespeech  (like refusing to use the right pro-noun when adressing a trans person) :),0
Point taken. No disrespect meant. And of course we don't accept any transphobia here.,0
That's not hate speech just because you don't like it  it's just adhering to simple biology,0
Oh people are not allowed to use their free speech? I though we lived in a free world. Not a fucking dicatorship?,0
Sander Midskog   Nope. Reading comprehension: You're confusing sex with gender. The two are separate  but related terms. Your sex is biological  while your gender is mostly an entirely social/societal construct. Look it up.,0
Gabriel Bagley You're confusing sex with gender. An individual's sex is indeed biological and determined by chromosomes. Gender is not  but there are a great many who erroneously mix those two terms up all the time.,0
Anthony Lindnilsson You got it the wrong way around. A 'dictatorship' is were people with power (aka people with privilege) impose and force their world view and values on people with less power (aka people with less privilege)  just like a cisman telling a transwoman she's not a woman because  according to this particular man's world view  she isn't! There might be free speech in a democratic society but not by means of harassment  bullying and force. In a free democratic society we respect each other and each others' lives - we make space - we acknowledge each other - we try to reflect and understand! What Kenneth is saying (I think) is that people that don't respect these values should be banned for making Roskilde Festival an unsafe space for people with less privilege.  And Gabriel Bagley - remember that biology is build in a theoretical understanding of our world  that is grounded in fact that we deem as true to our world view. Yes  chromosomes exist  but they don't make people  their lives and their self understanding. It might blow your mind that there's more to life than biology  ),0
Sander Midskog And you are still an idiot.,0
can you please oh please bring bruce back to roskilde?,0
If you book them  they will come!,0
Perhaps the same guys as your picture from yesterday :-),0

Catch this international hitmaker at Roskilde Festival 2017!  When Cashmere Cat isn't busy producing music for the likes of The Weeknd  Kanye West  Charli XCX and Tinashe  the Norwegian musician writes his own music. He's just released his debut including this smash hit.,3
Countdown is not only about the hottest new electronic musicians. In 2016 we kicked off a project where we invited young talented visual artists to create unique visuals for the shows on Countdown.   Read more about the project and the incredible VJs who will raise your Countdown concert experience in 2017: roskil.de/vj,23
Oskar Palsby do it,0
Did Coldplay already been in Roskilde Festival? Would love to watch them if they are one of the artists! Love their songs soo much!!! ????????????????,0
Some dress up  others make thematized camps. Camp Vienna has a different approach - they bake cookies.  What's YOUR Roskilde specialty?,15
Reading cartoons and pissing off my friends for not drinking enough,0
We party harder Matthew Jeffery Nitai Thomassen,0
camp vienna sang me a song as it was my first time at roskilde last year :),0
Motherly love and care,0
We bring a foam canon  and throw a foam party in the Roskilde sun! B-),0
Cheese buffet at CAMP FRI OST. Celebrating the birthday of MacGyver  our favorite security guard in the G tower.,0
Passing out in a chair !,0
I am so unique. My speciality is to drink,0
Posters saying  CAMP JANNICK  all over the place !,0
Coffin Camp simply hosts parties every night at 23:59 during warm-up at Agora C,0
We usually kidnap people in animal costumes and we duct tape them.. or else its mud limbo,0
In my experience you should NEVER accept cookies on ROSKILDE,0
I went by myself in a bunny suit.,0
CAMP VIENNA  Camp Braunschweig and Camp Wolfpack from Dana Point  California  see you soon!  -),0
Camp Wolfpack camps next to CAMP VIENNA and crashes there parties.  And we also fly tents!,0
Going by yourself from halfway around the world with no tent and no camp? Everyone I met seemed to think it was special.,0
People were friendly and sorted me out. I've got more of a plan this year!,0
and we hope  that Kasper would be signed...,0
Get your transport on at the greatest party of the year!   #roskildefestival,0
We’re going electronic today.  Moderat  Chromeo  Kavinsky  James Holden and Forest Swords are added to the Roskilde 2014 line-up.  Press play for some tunes.,68
Perhaps here? http://www.flickr.com/photos/roskildefestival,0
It's the exact same thing guys !! Its so confusing.. I want to see a picture of Yelawolf - If I search Yelawolf on the tags - then NOTHING comes up..  Get a proper system for next year - This is too confusing,0
In 2016 we introduced the Countdown Stage. Home of upcoming electronic music. After the first four days of the festival  the stage transformed into an entrance portal to the Apollo area.   Here's that transformation boiled down to 1 minute and 7 seconds!,19
During the first four days of the festival  camps compete in five different challenges. Each day there will be a new winner. The final winner will be announced on Friday between 1-2pm,0
I can't seem to remember what this is all about,0
#RF14 - The Mixtape has begun  and we need your help!  ,0

Good seeing you guys :),0
Hej Annette  you are able to bring a container that can be recycled (and not glass) with up to 0.5 litres drink of your choice into the festival grounds.,0
Hmm  that shouldn't be an issue. We are looking into it!,0
Yes  but not the lid!?!?!? Water bottles work better with lids  and they are sold with lids in the bars,0
http://www.rockfreaks.net/news/6804 And now AC/DC going to tour again :),0
ps: this is old news but still there is still hope :),0
You are one persistent motherf.....  I like it!,0
Let s hope for AC/DC @ Roskilde Festival this summer. Could be the best booking ever if they will book AC/DC :),0
Despite all the talk from Brian Johnson I highly doubt if they are ready tour in the summer. If they are going into the studio in May it seems more likely with a tour next year.,0
Last time when AC/DC record a album it was only 6 weeks. Australian rockers AC/DC will celebrate their 40th anniversary in 2014 by performing 40 shows around the world  while recording their first new album in five years. From http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/17/acdc-celebrate-40th-40-shows They could do some festivals in july. I really hope :),0

G'day. Thank you for the best Roskilde Festival i have ever been at. I got one question/story for you. Yesterday morning at 9'o'clock i met this girl at an amazing dressed as a penguin (a very nice one)  at the party there were around 50 people partying like it was their last in their life. Here comes my question: Does anyone know the name of the penguin?  (please do not answer if you do not got her name) Roskilde Greetings from Asger,0
This was such an amazing experience I could never have imagined before! Thank you Bruce  thank you Roskilde! I'll always keep on smiling thinking about this... ,0
Thanks for an awesome festival! Allready looking for next years  hoping that you'll get Netsky to make an appearance!!,0
LAST CHANCE TO WIN TICKETS AND FESTIVAL HUTS   Just follow the link and make your own poster. http://roskil.de/highlights   Deadline 7 May,2
Carla Martin worth a try??,0
Catherine Carey I forgot to include icona pop  they're up there with the scissor sisters in my books!,0
The winners are Andreas Sollien  Asbjørn Lauge  Siv Handegard  Kalinka Vangstrup and Juliette Kristina. Congratulations guys! You have been notified,0
Hi! If I booked entrance East  does that mean I will have a garanteed spot on clean and silence or do I have to book that also? And if I do will a be given a delegated spot or can I pick spot myself? Thankfull for your answer! ??,0
No  it's the other way around. You have to book a Silent & Clean pre-entrance ticket  but that one includes an entrance booking for East as well. A booking for entrance East alone does not grant you access to S&C right off the bat.  There are no predetermined spots in S&C – you have to run and secure one for yourself. You are guaranteed that there's space somewhere in the S&C area though  provided that you arrive within the timeframe specified on the S&C pre-entrance ticket. After that timeframe has elapsed  the area will be opened up and  topped up  with regular festivalgoers without a S&C ticket.,0
Thank you so so much ????! I will dir go and book pre-entrance for S&C.,0
Whoo  those last accomodation tickets for Get A Tent  Get A Place and Tenthouse sold out fast. Thanks to everybody on the waiting list!   If you're keen on a one-day ticket for Saturday  you shouldn't sit on your hands too long. They're selling pretty fast these days and will soon be sold out. Get a move on it  all you Saturdaysters!   Entrance booking is also popular. Entrance East is almost full. If you want in early  move on this early(ish).   If you like a nice and quiet campsite and want early access to it  then you should secure your Silent & Clean pre-booking. We don't have many left.   On a final note  Full Festival Tickets are also in high demand  and we can safely say that they will all be gone in good time before the festival. Get your ticket while you still can.,82

Hi Lizette. Entrance booking for Entrance South is included in your Silent & Clean voucher  and not the other way around. You will be able to pick the spot yourself,0
Thanks  I saw but i dont know my plans yet ?? Bråvalla sounds cool - good luck with selling your  get a place  and have fun ??,0

http://www.ac-dc.net/news/news.php?news_id=374 Legendary Anglo-Australian hard rockers AC/DC will enter a studio in Vancouver  British Columbia  Canada in May  presumably to begin recording their first new material since 2008's  Black Ice  album. In addition  the band will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year by playing 40 shows around the world. Please book AC/DC to Roskilde Festival this summer :),0
http://gaffa.dk/nyhed/81027 It s look AC/DC will first tour in 2015. Then if that is true then i hope we will get The Rolling Stones to play Roskilde. They will be in Europe June/july this year and i hope we wil get AC/DC next year. But i really want AC/DC to headline this year hehe :),0
I will never forgive this festival for making Shlohmo stop playing after just one small hour. Should've lasted all night  all next day  and all year!,0
We never want the good stuff to end. Unfortunately  it has to. We're glad to hear you enjoyed it  though.,0
This year’s line-up is presented in six different colours. Why this rainbow? Because we will have a special focus on cultural equality in 2017 with themes like gender  sexuality  everyday racism and identity.   We will explore the concept of cultural equality through workshops  debates  happenings and much more  and we really hope you’ll hop on board! We’ve got a number of awesome and inspiring partners to help us out. Read much more about our partners and Equality 2017: roskil.de/equality,51
Tema = SJW's.,0
^Wut happens when you listen to Rihanna,0
And the veteran singer says the band would consider making more festival appearances in future after breaking their own rule to play the Download event at Donington  UK in 2010. http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/johnson-burned-by-acdc-cannon/ And now AC/DC going to tour this year. Come on Roskilde  you can do it. Book AC/DC :),0
Johnson tells Fox News: “I wouldn’t like to do another one like the last one. We never want to go on stage and have people saying  ‘Oh  you should have seen them ten years ago.’ So I doubt we’ll be doing a big one. If we could do some festivals I wouldn’t mind that at all – that would be lovely.”,0
Even villains take time off to kick it at Roskilde Festival.  Thanks for the pic  Lasse Pedersen!,23

Hi !   We are a group of international students in RUC. We are writing our semester project focussing on Roskilde Festival and the spirit of volunteering(the DNA of Roskilde Festival  no volunteers  no festival).   We are really interested to make 1-to-1 interview with someone  who has experience volunteering at least 1 time in Roskilde festival. The interview will be conducted in English.   The interview will focus on your own motivation to volunteer in Roskilde Festival and why.   If I've catch your interest  pls  write me a message or write a comment and we will contact you.   Thanks in advanced!  Riikki  Marco  Nora  Agnes.,0

In addition  the band will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year by playing 40 shows around the world.  From http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/brian-johnson-says-acdc-will-enter-studio-in-may/#utjvSzz8lukVhtm9.99  Please give AC/DC a call. They need to play Roskilde this year :),0

Roskilde Festival I will buy my ticket soon  but can't find where to book entrance like the other years. Do you know when you will release tickets with possibilty to book entrece as well?,0
Go ahead and buy the ticket. It hasn't been decided yet how to go about the opening. But if we do have entrance booking  you'll need a ticket to do so anyways - and in that case we'll let you know.,0
So when will you decide how the entrance booking will work...if you will have any...Having a functional system would spare us ALOT of frustrations...Can't be that hard to come up with an idea that works  right?,0
Anders Lindstrom  trust us - it isn't that easy.,0
so what's the struggle? Tell us?,0

Malou Marquard Rosenkjær  get a place??????,0
Maria Marquard  Thomas Andersen - get a tent??,0
mummy  do we do lines? Jeppe,0
If we have booked in  silent and clean  can we still get a tent? #desperateAussieneedsatent Nicklas Korsholt Abel,0
Kanon :D,0
Not at all  darling,0
Maybe we need to book the get a tent east option?,0
Get A Tent is not in the Silent & Clean area. You pretty much just have to decide which you prefer and go for that. But be aware that it is a very limited number of Get A Tents that will be available tomorrow and the demand is sky high.,0
Sign up for a tenthouse (comes with a mattress),0
Received the link for Get a Place and Tenthouse  but did not receive one for Get a Tent East (which was the one we wanted to try for). Not fair </3,0

On top of Orange Stage during Mew's concert 7 July 2012 - photo: CphCph,317
That must be high up.. you can see that the horizon really is round.,0
It's been taken with a fish eye lense  that's why the horizon is round. lol.,0
That is soo cool. I really miss not being there. ,0
Fish eye  - by the way nice spot and picture,0
Remember to follow CphCph on Facebook. Follow the link  ),0
 Oh look  it's a little piece of my heart.. ,0
I know a magician never reveals his tricks  but please explain how the **** they took this pic? ,0
Søren  from our point of view we can say that we gave access to the photographers to all kinds of impossible spots during the festival. This one is actually taken ON TOP of the stage. What they did photo-wise  we'll let it be up to the photographers to answer.,0
CphCph you are the Boss :),0
Kristina  see our comment above. No chopper pic here.,0
Best concert I've been to!! Many thanks to Mew for this special show :),0

Is it possible to buy a printed version? ,0
Yeah Alright. Love it that you let the photografers play around. Thats   go stil!  cphcph <3 ,0
next year I will climb up here...,0
Dear Roskilde  I forgot to purchase the news-paper package on Sunday. Is there any possible way of getting my hands on to it? (This year you have a fancy plastic bag for it all!),0
Definitely. We'll post a little something on our website very soon.,0
Kommer fra Roskilde  bor i Kbh  spiller musik - that's all I know!,0
Jesus Christ Roskilde Festival  20 minutes in the queue and still no closer - pretty obvious your festival is largely organised by men!!,0
Just in case you are not aware - see below for inspiration to headliners  )   (Copy/pasted from the forum)   Outkast:  Thursday is free Friday is free  Saturday at Wireless Festival in Birmingham  England Sunday at Wireless Festival in London  England  Drake:  Thursday is free Friday at Wireless Festival in Birmingham  England Saturday at Wireless Festival in London  England Sunday is free  Kanye West:  Thursday is free Friday at Wireless Festival in London  England Saturday is free Sunday at Wireless Festival in Birmingham  England  Pharrel Williams:  Thursday is free Friday at Wireless Festival in London  England Saturday is free Sunday at Wireless Festival in Birmingham  England,0
It's nice to see that the busy performers get some free time as well.,0
Not the answer I was hoping for! My fingers are still crossed though..,0
We announce Förtress  Get Your Gun  Mont Oliver  My Heart the Brave  Narcosatanicos and Ra.  Six upcoming bands to play our Rising stage. For fans of hard rock  punk noise  psych rock or more urban tones. Listen below.,28

The incredible DIY rapper  Princess Nokia   is adding more girl power to this years Roskilde Festival.   Explore #RF17 and get to know this cool tomboy in 60 seconds.,16
Noah Hansen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UR NOT READY FOR HER,0
I hope you may have given an incorrect picture of the artist  because when you say  she asked the men to go in the back and women up the front  it honestly sounds like segregation to me. I don't see how that is good advertisement for RF or this artist.,0
Alexandra Adriana Quinonez Winther (y),0
Lykke Svarre Thouraya Sidani Aspen m.fl.,0
Cool? HELL YES!!! But  tomboy ? Really  Roskilde Festival? She's a powerful WOMAN. It's not the 60s.,0

Howdy y'all!  I had an absolutely amazing first Roskilde! Thanks for making it so incredible :) I have a request though from everyone at the festival.   I was dresses as a panda the entire Roskilde and the last four days I was a crippled panda with crutches. I am asking that is any of y'all took a picture with me to send it to me if that's okay! I want to put it on my panda blog and will of course give y'all credit for taking it.   Please if you or know anyone who took a picture with the panda that would be much appreciated! Send it via Facebook or just email me at vtaupradist@gmail.com. Tak!  <3 Vanda the Panda,0

Har någon någonsin skrivit en låt om Roskilde Festival? Någon låt där Roskilde Festival finns med bland textraderna? Vore kul att höra i sådant fall.   Njut av årets festival  vänner.  >> Did anyone ever write a song about Roskilde Festival? I would love to hear that song if it's out there!,0
https://youtu.be/MpF5R29G6yk awesome song  in Danish though,0
DNKL  is also playing Roskilde 2014.  Having just four letters in your name shouldn't mean that you're overlooked. Here's the playlist for Apollo Countdown.,5
comes volbeat and nod and jay and nephew at Roskilde Festival 2014,0
Please please sign Neelix! He's not too big but has really really good live performances and I'm sure he would love to come to the best festival in the world!,0
thank you for yet another fantastic year and remember it's only 355  days till warm-up starts again,0
Anybody from Turkey. Please contact me,0
How old do you at least have to get to Roskilde Festival,0
Our rules say: if you're under 18  you have to be accompanied by an adult over 18 whom you trust.,0
15. Please note the answer given by Roskilde Festival is incorrect unless they changed the rules since last year.  You have to be 16 to buy alcohol in shops in Denmark but Roskilde might have a general 18 year rule  so that I don't know.  You have to be 18 to be served alcohol in Denmark.,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  any chance we'll be seeing a new forum or an update at least this year? #newRFforum,0
Sorry  no. Most people tend to use social media away from our site.,0
I'm sorry Roskilde Festival but that is an entirely unacceptable answer. February 10th 2009 you brought down the old forum  exactly 5 years ago. The new one opened March 22nd 2009 and ever since day one you solemnly promised that it would be a temporary solution until you found a better one.  You've had 5 years. We demand that you implement or present a plan for when you will implement a new and updated forum immediately. We're done asking you nicely. Take action now.  #RF14 #RoskildeFestival #newRFforum,0
I ageee! I joined the forum when I was building my first sound system around the spring of '09  and have since my first day seen these promises of a new forum. Like Johnny says  we're done asking nicely. Make it happen. And by doing so  giving all of us a united platform to communicate through. You'll never feel more lost than when you're trying to get a message out through Facebook. Just look at this post  and see how many people we reach. We'll have to get hundreds of likes just for it to pop a little bit. ,0
Read more about it here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/roskilde-festival-2014-starts-here/,0
The 2017 map on the website doesn't seem to work. Is it possible for you to upload it here on Facebook? Thanks,0

Are you not at Roskilde or are you stuck in your camp and can’t make it to the festival area? Not a problem! This year we will stream a selection of various concerts from Orange and Arena stage. Find out which at the Roskilde Festival website.   http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/live-streaming/orange,8
won't miss a thing this year Tom Mullumby Matt Donnan Heath Mitchell,0
Why not Florence ?,0
Stream is not working as you probably know by now. Any alternate way to watch it? Tried 3 different browsers.,0
Livestream for Arena is up and running! Tune in here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/live-streaming/arena,0
Are you streaming the Die Antwoord concert aswell ?,0
hahah im actually going to roskilde:P,0
We are updating the live streaming constantly  so keep an eye out for the concerts you want to see! :),0
It’s not all artists who want their concerts livestreamed and often it’s also a bit of a puzzle to coordinate and make agreements about livestreams. But this year we are happy to be able to livestream so many great bands. /Roskilde Festival,0
Thanks for your patience! It is up and running now.,0
Hmm  unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. Now the window for the video is just white. As opposed to earlier when the play button was there but just could not be pressed.,0
Same here.,0
This is all i see,0
Thanks  just want to watch the Arena show though :),0
Same here.,0
Now it is working!,0
All the live streamed concerts can be seen after Roskilde Festival ends.,0
Florence is always live streamed from other festivals so it shouldn't be a problem??,0
Why is Florence not yet on the list Roskilde Festival ? :(,0
We are not streaming Die Antwoord concert unfortunatly!,0
Monday-Friday we announce upcoming acts for our two stages Rising and Apollo Countdown.  Today we announce The Awesome Welles  Blaue Blume  Communions  The Minds of 99 and Slöa Knivar  Give them a listen below.,13
!!!!!!! :D,0
Nice :) when are you announcing some headliners you Said in a couple of weeks  a month ago :),0
You say that there will be music in the 4 warm up days but If the festival opens at 18:00 there can´t be many concerts at Sunday?,0
Solid. The Awesome Welles will be killer.,0
I can't believe your line up this year. I haven't heard of one single act. I expect better acts soon  if not  then all the money I've spent is a waste.,0
Sunniva - if you dont know a single act I'd say that's your own fault..,0
In this whole sphere of complaining  I'd just like to express my affection for the way you guys announce your acts. It's more interesting to continuously check back for new announcements  and it has the added benefit of giving me much more time to check out the individual acts I hadn't heard of. Cheers!,0
Please send an email to info@roskilde-festival.dk,0
Thanks for great fun all week everyone! For those of you who participated in Roskilde Festival 2012  can you please spend two minutes of your time to fill out a questionnaire for me regarding visitor motivations? THANK YOU SO MUCH - All your help is much appreciated! <3 ,0

Here's the official playlist of Roskilde 2014 as it looks so far.  Still got a long way to go. In the end we'll have about 160 acts in all genres and sizes.  Make sure to follow us on Spotify to get to know the latest music announcements.,1
You guys should totally make an official WIMP playlist too. :-),0
WiMP have actually started making one themselves: http://wimp.dk/playlist/dfb70047-f877-48de-a093-1bc7d2e4c3d0,0
http://fireflyfestival.com/lineup/ Foo Fighters are playing there. Let s get them to Roskilde also :),0
It's an american festival. Actually FF playing there kinda lessens the probability that they're going to be at Roskilde.,0
I hope Foo Fighters will be in Europe in July :),0
Check out Niki And The Dove Live from Roskilde Festival 2012 on Livestage TV!,0

Both of you're births was unnecessary at best.,0
Roskilde peeps  I am looking for a full festival ticket. Let me know if you are selling one :),0
You should have the  new Joakim Thåström  playing at Roskilde 2014. Don´t miss Wretemo.  http://open.spotify.com/album/2VkhUrimszjrrRi8kJ92No,0

Earlier today we announced Damon Albarn for Roskilde 2014.  If you dig his music  let us know your favourite song from one of his projects.  We’ll collect your picks in a playlist.,15
Well  last year at this time it looked pretty much the same. Northside were faster out of the box with their bigger names. Then April came and Roskilde redeemed themselves. With the additions of Metallica and Chase & Status  they even completely ran NS over. Not that NS has a bad lineup at all – it's rather impressive. But you can't really compete with at 160-200-name strong lineup  when you only have 40 slots to fill.  I expect the same to happen this year.,0
Every year we hear this shrill whine from NS fans in the beginning of the year just to have their arses handed to them when the final program is released. It's getting old and pathetic really.  Please take a hint from the fact that the NS arrangers don't see NS as competitors for RF but a supplement for those that happen to live near the festival. It's not like NS could ever attract an as internationally diverse crowd because NS doesn't really have anything to offer besides a re-listen to some artists that have generally played RF one or a few times before.  It's not like there is a crowd community based on other activities besides music. You could probably cancel all music at RF and some people wouldn't notice if they weren't told. You can sniff and be snobby about that and claim they aren't music fans then  and you'd probably be right  not all that attend RF are pretentious hipsters. It's a far more diverse crowd for RF and RF is far more than just music.  tl dr: NS :'( : RF :p,0
spot on!,0
hi  if i not form denmark  can i be volonteer or not ?,0
Everybody can  but you will have to wait until April to apply.,0
What Thor Jorbin said. Or you're welcome to send an email to job@roskilde-festival.dk for more info.,0
Damon Albarn is playing Roskilde Festival 2014.  We’re also adding Interpol and Warpaint to the line-up.  Three acts added to a line-up already consisting of acts such as Arctic Monkeys  Major Lazer  Trentemøller and 28 more. We’ll end up with 160 acts in all genres and sizes.  See more here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/,40
If Damon Albarn is headlining  that's  again  pretty weak! Just my two cents.,0
Isn't this forty bands less than 2013?,0
Emil Mortensen  time will tell what he plays. One can only hope for a bit of everything  right?,0
Sam and Nicolas  what  what and what?,0
Tom...  Jack White played about 1 hour and 30 minutes. With lots of White Stripes and Raconteurs songs. You're right  it was awesome.,0
Aleksi Pertola  we appreciate your cents. Getting rich by now  -),0
Jack White was a headliner and in my book Damon is even bigger.,0
The thing is though  with most European festivals shoring up with proper headliners with massive pull  I think you should announce at least one big headliner soon. OK  AM may well be headliner material  but a guy who hasn't even released one solo album yet is not  no matter how you spin it.  It reminds me of a certain José Mourinho  renowned for his ability to paint his mistakes and failures as strokes of genius.  We decided that Mastodon is a headliner because we believe in them and wanted to take the risk  is a great example  I think in reality it was  We couldn't find/afford enough headliners  so we bumped Mastodon up and crossed our fingers .  This year I'm really afraid you consider Trentemøller and Damon Albarn as headliners  and the fact that you neither confirm nor deny this suggests to me that you're in the same situation once again: unable to convince/afford the really big guns - and so keeping bands that in reality are subliners at the very most as plan B's in case.  It's not that I think Roskilde Festival isn't great  it's that since 2006 (with the exception of 2009)  the strength of headliners has been in steady decline in parallel with the increase in obscurity elsewhere in the line-up. Fair enough  I also like to make discoveries at RF  but in my opinion there's a distinct lack of bands that have that  I REALLY want to see those guys  allure.  When I look at Hellfest's line-up for example  I'm not exaggerating when I say I have that feeling with more than 50% of the bands. Granted  that's a metal festival  and I'm a rock/metal aficionado  but still. With the RF line-up so far  I get that feeling with one act (and HUGE applause for picking up on the hype by the way!): Bombus.,0
Aleksi: I completely agree that Mastodon was a bit of a blunder. It showed in the meagre audience turnout. The festival that year was  however  sold out  maybe because of the other headliners?  What I don't agree with is that Albarn and Trentemøller can't be considered headliners. I think your rock POV once again betrays you there.   Trentemøller has headlined Roskilde once before – in 2009. He is huge in club circuits and either subheadlines or headlines the festivals he play. Considering that this is a rare  homecoming gig  I think he certainly could be the sole Danish headliner of the year.  As for Damon Albarn  he has been booked for Latitude  BBC6 Music Festival and Rock Werchter. Each of these festivals also consider him a headliner. Blur has played Roskilde a handful of times and only the very first time – in 1992 – they weren't headlining. The Good  The Bad & The Queen  his lesser known side project apart from Gorillaz  were also playing headlining festival shows almost everywhere they went in 2007. I don't see why he shouldn't headline.,0
You're right  I'll concede. But the question remains: should the fact that someone has big successful projects automatically mean that he's equally as big solo?,0
No  it shouldn't  you're right about that.   I think  for example  that Werchter and the bunch of other festivals who have all booked Robert Plant's new project are right in not making him a headliner despite his past in Led Zeppelin.   It's not always completely transparent to me either when an artist should be called a headliner or not  but Plant has been out of vogue for a long time despite strong releases. He has branded himself more and more as a niche artist. Which is fine  but Albarn ought to have more mass appeal.,0
Sigurd Moe Nyquist  it is indeed. Rad more here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/roskilde-festival-2014-starts-here/,0
Furthermore Albarn seems to be playing songs from his previous projects on this tour. A concert with Albarn featuring songs from Blur  Gorillaz  The Good the Bad and the Queen and his solostuff should be considered a headliner. Nevertheless I miss some of the BIG headliners as well. But the number of such bands is decreasing and the ones left gets more and more expensive  so it might be a more difficult task than it has been earlier.,0
By the way I do feel that Roskilde has treated us with some fine headliners even in recent years. Kraftwerk and Metallica last year... And Springsteen the year before that. Prince in 2010. Coldplay  Oasis  Pet Shop Boys and Kanye West in 2009. Radiohead Judas Priest and Neil Young in 2008. Only 2011 really seamed lacking in the big-headliner-departmnet in my opinion.,0
Dutch for the win I guess!,0
Damon Albarn is NOT considered a headliner at Werchter... if so... They got waaay too many headliners.. well okay... he is headlining the Klub C stage which is the second largest stage out of 3... but still... Poster wise.. not a headliner at all :),0
Mikkel: We'll see  when they release their poster  I guess. I am pretty sure that their Klub C headliners are considered  real  headliners too. Skrillex for example  who is billed similarly  also headlines another Danish festival.,0
Wait  we’ve got MORE music for you this week. More specifically tomorrow.  Here’s something to chew on while you wait.,10
Rage Against the Machine,0
The one in the right corner could remind of some of Tools album art! http://caudallure.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/1217891347094.jpg,0
Biffy clyro and i'll be there!!!,0
Disneyland After Dark,0
WHAT'S WITH THE FACE!?!?!?!? AAAARRRH!,0
Seems Gaffa was too quick for Roskilde's liking  ) http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:BXdUJJtqLsMJ:gaffa.dk/nyhed/80560+&cd=1&hl=da&ct=clnk&client=safari,0
Damon Albarn will be awesome. I saw Blur last year and the show was awesome,0
Thanks for all the guesses. All three acts were mentioned  some earlier than others. But you nailed the teaser. Again.  Props to Rasmus Andersson who first guessed Interpol  Jonatan Hall who first guessed Warpaint and Anders Cold who guessed Damon Albarn. Nice going!  Here's how we constructed the teaser:  'Heart equals skull' is a reference to Warpaints new single  Love Is to Die  (make sure to give it a spin  it's great!).  The lights and the switch are a reference to Interpol's debut album  Turn On The Bright Lights  from 2002.   The 3D drawing of a face in the lower right corner is a reference to the video for Damon Albarn's new single  Everyday Robots . In this video you can see a full 3D construction of his head.,0
Well figured that was a secret and if the last right had 1 mil likes  it would added up give 2 5 mil :),0
it had to be done,0
aka D.A.D. yeah  the RETURN. :-),0
I certainly hope not.,0
No it really didn't,0
Nobody can see it? It is Donald Duckface = Disney & it is dark. And D.A.D. tour in Summer..,0
They don't exist anymore.,0
Omg is this for real ?,0
Bigger chance of it being Daft Punk tbh.,0
The original is here: http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-709679-wireframe-face.php?st=0ea6e9f  Could the meaning be that the artist is also the lead singer in a virtual band? If yes  then Damon Albarn springs to mind.,0
Mads Wichmann Kristensen  don't be lead on by Alexander. It's not Tool.,0
BAH! :D,0
Oh dont destroy the joke :D,0
http://yourfuturein.it/resources/fun-and-informative-it-features/ and here,0
Then it must be Damon Albarn,0
Yes it did  they owe us RATM :),0
Buuh  Gaffa - you suck,0
It shows up when you google  IT Features ,0
Agreed  Blur are great live,0
Reminds me of Disclosure  just don't get the green,0
He will start his tour in Iceland on July 7. So he is not coming to Roskilde sorry to say that,0
So I guessed right  but for the wrong reason. Luckyyy,0

Hej  got a little question! Gonna arrive tomorrow from Berlin and don´t really have a tent/camp. Do they offer locker at the festival? Or does anybody got a little free spot or does feeling alone in their Tent? :D xoxo,0
We have wardrobes where you can store stuff and it is definitely possible to shop a small tent in the gearshops at camping and finding a spot for said tent in the camping area. Or...try giving these guys'n'girls a holler -> https://www.facebook.com/CampUnknown/info,0
Or just walk the camping area and greet people and tell them your situation. Roskilde is filled with friends you haven't met yet. You will find a camp - that we guarantee  -),0
I´m really sure about finding cool people and a place to sleep. It´s just a nice feeling to know that before you get there! :D otherwise I wouldn´t do that trip all by myself! Thanks alot for your help <3 Can´t wait to finally take that 7 hour bus to cph tomorrow <3 :D,0
HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants! #RF15     I think it's important that we help each other at Roskilde Festival. For the last five years I've worked as a social worker in Handicamp  but it doesn't feel much like work because we're also friends. It's a grey zone and sometimes it's a bit tough. But it's a really good companionship and I wouldn't want to miss it.   Kamilla  26  from Denmark,7
No coments and stay away from my home,0
That's my girl! <3 Kamilla!,0
Tell me more about Handicamp! It looks awesome  would love my son to go with you guys one day! :),0
Hey Roskilde Festival  how about you give some credit to Brandon Stanton  the guy behind Humans of New York who's idea you're using? Just you know  it would be nice. https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork,0
i'm an Australian social worker who <3's Roskilde Festival & would love to be a social worker volunteer there but alas I don't speak Danish (which you have to be able to!),0

Today we announced A$AP Ferg  Earl Sweatshirt and World's Fair – and here's the rundown of today's events  responses and DRAMA (don't worry  it ended well).,2
Whats up with the website?,0
February 6 - Stones to play Pinkpop? - Today's Rehearsals  => We hear  that Pinkpop chef Jan Smeets is also in talks with the band - for a date during the festival in the summer. As you can read at nu.nl  Jan expects to know whether the Stones play Pinkpop or not within the next two days... thanks to Perry Kuiphuis for the link and Rick for his comments here. From http://stonesnews.com/  I hope for Roskilde are also talking to The Rolling Stones and will book them :),0
Hey. For some reason the band descriptions won't come up when clicked on your webpage. I tried both chrome and safari.,0
Same here..,0
Thank you for noticing! We will look into that right away,0

ASAP FERG!!!!! SO IMPORTNANT,0
Roskilde Festival keep a proper lineup or you're boykotted.,0
who??,0
I fully understand that Roskilde is all about musical diversity and that some of the best experiences often are bands written with small letters on the poster. But headliners and subliners sells tickes (I presume) and they really missing on the poster so far. Many of us have to make a choice of which festival to attend and Roskilde Festival is making a normally easy choice very hard this year.,0
Thanks for getting back to me  must've hit something then. Opinions are by nature subjective. What is the reason for not disclosing who is in the bookinggroup?,0
Great booking! People that are complaining and almost threatening RF that no one will attend their festival should remind themselves  that people say this every year yet RF still gets sold out/near sold out. There's over 100 acts to go  there will be something for every musical taste for sure.,0
This is just crap! Please step up your game!,0
Roskilde Festival when will we get next big name ? soon ? i happy with Rob zombie  it is going to be awesome show,0

Thanks to all of you who tried to figure out the artist announcements. It didn’t seem to be that difficult this time. Every three acts were guessed very quickly.  The three acts in the teaser are World’s Fair at the top  Earl Sweatshirt in the left corner and A$AP Ferg in the right corner.  Much respect to Mathias Frosz. It only took him 1 minute to guess A$AP Ferg and Earl Sweatshirt. We are amazed. Also props to Anders Cold who guessed World’s Fair. They seemed to be the hardest to guess out of the three teasers.   And the logic behind it all:  We tried to communicate that the teasers referred to an album cover where every person in the teaser were replaced by a simple drawing of a man. Even the background colour of the albums in the teaser was similar to the real album covers.,0
Cool. Now communicate some Big rock artists :),0

Carlsberg prevents small breweries from running non-profit charity festival bars at Roskilde. What is next? McDonalds becomes head sponsors and all food served at the festival is Big Macs?,0
Well   like  - as in your post. It needs to be said. A lot. But it's nothing new - after all  Carlsberg has had the monopoly for 20 years - and will keep it for the next four at least. Not that I steer clear of Tuborg at the festival site (having one right now) - but then  I've also had a small stash of Hardcore IPA and I Hardcore You. :-P,0
Roskilde Festival cooperates very well with Tuborg - the official main sponsor of the festival. They bring value to the festival and vice verca. Therefore  they may impose some requirements.,0
Roskilde Festival - not seeing Mikkel's post as a criticism of the festival as such - more of those requirements of Carlsberg's  which are rather unique on the festival. Yes  because they hold a unique position  and economically they may be essential - but the way they take advantage of it in general is really not becoming of them - nor does it fit the festival's standpoint in general.,0
So Roskilde Festival - if McDonalds pays double and becomes head sponsor  are you willing to let them prevent all other food stands as well. This is a questions of what you support. Monopoly or diversity? Which are the moral and ethic standards of Roskilde Festival and are you going to let some big money guys prevent you from practising these?,0
Its a Carlsberg/Bandidos PR event  everything else is secondary...,0
THANK YOU for booking Bruce Springsteen  I waited in line for 13 hours to get up front  and it was all worth it! He has such a speciel connection with his audience  and he came and sat down by us  and even let us play the strings of his guitar! It was the most amazing koncert in all my life! I will never forget this experience as long as I live! :D THANK YOU Roskilde!,0
Right now: Live streaming from H2O concert at Pavilion.  Read about H2O: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/band/singleband/h2o/,2
more punk next year please. 1-2 bands per year isn't enough when other genres get 10-20 each (and no  iceage etc are NOT punk),0
We had a music request campaign back in October. That's the perfect time for us to get all your inputs.,0
We announced Hookworms last Wednesday.  Their album  Pearl Mystic  topped Drowned in Sound's 'best of 2013' list.  Listen to the album in full right here. Let us know what you think.  We'll be back next week with more music.,3
Wow! I hope they get a late night spot at Pavilion like Titus Andronicus in 2010. That would be amazing!,0
It's awesome! I knew it was DiS you'd been reading  ),0
Can't wait to see them - the album is absolutely brillant. Thanks for booking them :),0
Hey guys! Wanna be one of the first festivals to accept bitcoin as payment for the ticket? It would promote the event to a new  international  audience and it would show support for a new decentralised currency that can change the world. If you guys do plan to do this  I want to be the first to purchase the ticket with bitcoin in show of support (and for the amazing experience at the fest as well),0
Don't think we're quite ready for that yet.,0
It is also cheaper to accept than credit card  even if you use service like BIPS to directly exchange the bitcoins to DKK when someone pays in bitcoin :),0
i think it would be bold and cool and isn't that what Roskilde is about?,0
This is a must guys VIP treatment allround Hans Henrik H. Heming,0
Thank you Howard  I would LOOOOOOVE to have a cup of coffee with the Roskilde Festival team to talk about Bitcoin payment opportunities :-),0
With the enormous focus on improving the wireless internet at Roskilde Festival each year  the foundation is already there for Bitcoin point of sale solutions. It is simply the matter of showing the merchants attending  the possibilities of accepting Bitcoin  say instead of cash. The benefits are there as well in 0% Payment Processing Fees  and when you don't need to carry a heavy safe with you to store the cash payments. AFAIK you can even charge your mobile phone there now? (Or better yet  lets call it Mobile Payment Device) Correct me if I am wrong Roskilde Festival,0
Damon Albarn to play Rock Werchter  let s get him also to Roskilde please :),0
I've tried to reach you guys  but you haven't answered my e-mail in two weeks now!  Come on!,0
Thanks a lot for a wonderful time outside the festival!  ) ,0
Thank you for giving me a great ninth Roskilde Festival!!! I'll see you next year.,0
Hey Roskilde! Mangler i stadig i tilføje de sidste navne? Og tør man håbe på endnu et hovednavn?  We've got 9 stages - and 175 acts playing them. More acts will be announced soon! ,0
Here's a summery house hit out of Australia from the competent hands of Rüfüs.  They will surely start a grand party at Roskilde Festival 2017!,6

Hey all! I'm looking for a ticket for Saturday. Any help is much appreciated! :) Thanks!,0
Today we announce 5 great alternative acts: Julia Holter  Future Of The Left  Merchandise  Hookworms and Black Pus.  Press play and listen to some of the most edgy  fresh and new names in alternative rock.  More music to come next week. In the end we'll have 160 acts in all kinds of genres and sizes.,17
Hookworms and Merchandise are excellent live,0
Still waiting for something worth buying a ticket for. When will you announce the big acts?,0
Black Pus!! We at Jazzhouse run Unseen Recordings and we did this great interview/live session with him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbRZccpDLI,0
Mattias Svensson  hang in there. They'll come. In the meantime you should give these acts a listen.,0
Paul Burgess  you've also had the pleasure of seeing them live?,0
Yes both of them. last couple of years Liverpool has the Psycadelic festival  Hookworms played it.  Merchandise have been going for a few years now. Known as a Manchester band  but in fact they are from a smaller place not far from Manchester. Merchandise remind me of Stone Roses/Joy Division  which is not a bad thing:-). So I am very happy that both will play Roskilde this year.,0
More Black Pus luv from his show at Jazzhouse: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELjzWGDDKU&hd=1,0
Paul Burgess  Merchandise may sound British - but they are in fact from Florida.,0
But it is difficult to wait and be patient  since the other big european player have already announced the names. And although i love roskilde not only for the music  it should be a reason to make me come to your festival. So far i have to names on the poster i want to see. On northside it is vice versa. Two names i don't want to see.... Same with smukfest. And not to mention sziget  rock im park or rock'n'heim. If you have only limited sources in money and time  roskilde has lost at this time of the year. And yes  i like what i hear  the bands you have chosen are excellent  but they do not make me and a lot of other people spend 300 euro on a ticket.,0
Florida might be considered a small place not far from Manchester....,0
The poster is revealed in April as always so be patient. :-),0
Manchester  Tennessee. In that case Florida is not far away :-),0
While I have you here  any chance of booking The Heavy :-),0
Oliver Polo  we'll have some of that soon.,0
Future Of The Left !! Can`t wait !,0
you can always go and Watch big names its the small fun and weird ones i love at Roskilde  ),0
It's always worth buying a ticket to Roskilde  the bands are just an extra treat,0
I agree with Esther. There are a lot of other festivals also and you cant visit them all. As it is right now Id rather spend my money on another festival. Ill can wait a little longer but I will have to make a choice soon. Some festivals are starting to run out of tickets already.,0
I'm absolutely thrilled about the Southkorean band that was announced a few weeks ago. :-),0
that is the problem: some festivals sell out extremly fast these days. and  as always  doesn't count for me. if the times are changing  sometimes small adjustments are due to be made. don't get me wrong. i love roskilde festival and I am a frequent visitor and supporter. But a lot of people tell me exactly what I have written above  when I ask if we meet at Roskilde this year.  in april a lot of people have already made their decisions and maybe have no more money left to spend it on RF.,0
Probably one of the best opinions about these announcements Esther Mai.,0
you got to keep in mind that RF have a considerably larger lineup  with a lot more artists  than a lot of the other festivals. to book 160 names  it takes time! the final poster releases in mid april  and its usually worth the wait! :),0
Kim: that is why you reveal headliners first  and then fill up the less attractive names afterwards.,0
Petteri: That tactic probably requires a bigger budget. It also contains the hidden risk of splashing out on a band who then flops with a later released album and thus won't be as attractive as when they were revealed.,0
You just missed The Brian Jonestown Massacre.. What up?,0
Jonas Binder Porsborg  ah ok. We're going for something else in 2014.,0
Afghan Whigs have a new album out in april. Book them! They were fantastic at Way out West in 2012. ,0

Will the live streams be available somewhere after the festival?,0
Marius  some of it will be available on our website. Clikc the 'TV' menu item and you should fine something.,0
It depends on how many people who were there at that moment. We hope you enjoyed the concert.,0

HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from two of our inhabitants!    We usually rent a car for the summer for traveling around Europe and visiting festivals. This is our second time at Roskilde and it's the best festival by far. Roskilde really stands out with it's atmosphere  different cultures and the people. At home I study architecture  but during the summer the car is everything. We sleep and live there. At the festivals we do tattoos  but when we're off we like to go to the smaller concerts  have a good time and meet new people.  Ran  24  and Shay  23  from Israel,8
Notice it is mostly men that is shown....   Women Are Half of us and also have both a purpose and an attitude .... :-),0
Well Hello guys! How about a visit to My place after Roskilde...,0
Why do u show so many men dont women go to roskilde ?,0
Men are to handsome there,0
Roskilde has a naked run and we are going to sign Ryan up apparently Danish men always get drunk and then naked Violet ??,0

Eyy  i totally met this guy ^^ Shay  if you read this  then thank you for letting me sit there in your shop for about an hour  (or more) while I was trying to feel better and use your mirror to fix my tired  bloaded face ^^ hehe. And thanks for the discount on the sunglasses too  btw. Appreciate it! (Y) I hope you had an awesome Festival and a great time in Denmark! :-))),0

Machine Head - audio review of their Roskilde gig today -  Skol mother f****s  - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh_QxDHydVE&feature=plcp,0
our cover of saturday at Roskilde is up now  have a look!,0
Good question! And frankly we don't know :),0
I can maybe shed some light to that  since I've been there for a long time.   Agora A used to be the volunteer camping area that is now just called Restricted Camping Darupvang. It's still there  north of Holbækmotorvejen. You follow the walking path extension of Darupvej northwards west of Skate City. Agora X  Y and Z are also volunteer camps. Agora D was for some years an  optional  camping area west of Darupvej that often didn't get activated anyway  since there was space enough at the rest of the camping areas. Agora F was a West side Agora south of Agora E way back. This was the place where I lived at my first Roskilde in '99. Agora I got eaten up by the gravel pit I think. I have no idea what happened to Agora O though. Q and onwards have never existed save for X  Y and Z mentioned above.  Here's an interesting map from 2008 which shows at least three of the letters missing now:  http://jacobpackert.dk/Files/Roskilde_Festival_2008_map_20080612_1000dpi.png  Another from 1997 showing that there used to be two stages where Apollo was this year: http://www.universitetsradioen.dk/roskilde/1998/kort.jpg  I think RF keeps the letters to make it easier to find our way around for us rotten fuckers who can remember the olden times of yore.,0
Still one-day tickets left for Sunday! Experience 33 bands playing today  for instance Björk  Santigold  Alabama Shakes.  Today's schedule: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/music/band_schedule/date/1341759600/,0

cant wait to jump into the moshpit for this one,0
Omg hahaha they're snapping back????,0
Haha :D!,0
Because she's a very famous Brazilian singer. I'm from Brazil and I'm so proud of her  she will just make that place more happy and like a carnival. Hopefully all the people there won't be so drunk and miss that.,0
That's so offensive. If you want pop music  go in the pop festivals  if u want rock  go in the rock festivals. Just don't offend this singer like that  because RF is just trying to give a chance for us to know more things  there's so much culture around us. I'm Brazilian and I'm so happy that she will be there. She's fantastic!,0
She's not that bad ??   An Brazilian defending   not fair right. But she's really not that bad :),0
Just like in Brazil we never heard about danish singers (literally no one) but still respecting. She don't scare anyone  she's just old and deserve respect. They just want a mix of cultures there  and thats always good.  But seems like samba is just a good thing when a girl is shaking her ass with a gringo in Rio.  I understand that people here might be sad about it  we also felt when rock in rio started to bring other genres of music  when it supposed to be Rock. But RF is a opening thing  and its great they're showing some of this.  I really admire the good danish artists here  and I hope you guys enjoy her concert.  Sorry to come with this. :),0
Ehm I don't think you've been to Roskilde in that case...,0

Ping Kenneth Kristensen  Niklas Eng  Nicolas Hansen  Michael Boye Olsen  Lots of guesses this time around. And we’re happy to see that most of you actually looked at the teaser instead of random guesses/hopes. And you were GOOD at it as well. 4 out of 5 acts were guessed.  The acts in the teaser are (from top right and clockwise): Merchandise  Hookworms  Future of the Left  Julia Holter and Black Pus.  It took Michael Boye Olsen 2 minutes (!) to guess Future of the Left. Nothing short of impressive! Also props to Kenneth Kristensen who first guessed Julia Holter  Niklas Eng who first guessed Hookworms and Nicolas Hansen who first guessed Merchandise. Nice going!  And now to the logic behind the teaser:  Merchandise (the band) was the most literal reference in this teaser: A picture of a band performing (blurred out) and at the very front of the photo a merch table.  Hookworms are from Leeds  which we indicated with a photo of Leeds United’s home field Elland Road.  Future of the Left has made a song called “Robocop 4: Fuck Off  Robocop”. That sort of explains the photo now  right?  Julia Holter’s latest album “Loud City Song” topped music magazine The Wire’s ‘best of 2013’ list. We showed a screen grab from the tv series “The Wire” and added “#1” at the bottom right corner.  Black Pus is a one-man band. Brian Chippendale from Lightning Bolt bangs the drums  screams into the microphone and makes lots of noise with effect pedals at the same time. We’ve shown a picture of his drums (not just random drums). We also tried to communicate that he does lots of visual arts besides his music.,0
You can have a clear conscience when you go to the Roskilde Festival. We are actually polluting less than an average Danish city the same size :-),2
What a crock of shit. How do you explain this crap? https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/295106_10150955541497426_1288585554_n.jpg,0
Of course there's lots of room for improvement :-) There are many initiatives to reduce the impact on the environment on Roskilde. Your post is a call to action on recycling and reusing instead of throwing away!,0
A good idea is to charge a small amount for a hard plastic glass. Which you can keep as a souvenir..and you refill at the bar instead of throwing away an empty plastic cup after every drink. Stops waste and litter everywhere thus a cleaner festival :)),0
Haha that means Danish litter even more than on festival? Disaster!,0
Its allright  you clean it up afterwards anyway right? Then you Can take your  time  and recycle the trash aswell if you like :-),0
why would you litter even more mate if your paying for the glass? i went to a festival which used the same idea and there was no litter. its a win win situation! saves on cleaning  no walking over loads of empty glasses! plus so much more better for the enviroment. if some one drinks 40 drinks thats 40 plastic cups instead of just 1. you save on so much unnecessary waste!,0
Of course 90.000 people produce lots of trash and litter. But the purity of Roskilde Festival lies in the fact  that you can see it. Back home festival goers hide their trash in bins and it gets also carried away like on the festival site.,0
Your guests have an attitude problem - and that is something you should work on. Check out these pix from Monday - 900 tons of trash waiting to be sorted! I especially loathe the fact that they've not even used the trash cans visible - they are almost empty while you see trash all over the place. Please - make this a priority! http://ekstrabladet.dk/Haandvaerkeren/article1789519.ece,0
Nikolaj  trust us  it is a priority - but without our participants' help it's an uphill effort. Fortunately  more people helped clean up this year so it's pointing in the right direction.,0
I worked as volunteer there  also Sunday & Monday - and that experience made me really hate such ignorant people. And saying that festival is less polluting than something else also Danish - is only making additional disgust in me  towards anything with prefix ''Danish''. -- For eg  I saw bunches of young adults - who probably never earned their own money  'cause they don't how to value anything - buying cans of beers & instead of drinking it jumping on it. Tents&other camping gear (that could worth about 500e) just used once & left there  also shoes that worth at least 100e. Food  so much still perfect food left... I think a town of 130k people could be fed with it for at least week. - I was planning to stay longer in Denmark  but I left earlier 'cause I just couldn't look anymore at such human stupidity  against Earth and other people  too.,0
Next live streams: Mutiny On The Bounty at 23:00 and Dead Skeletons 02:45. Both directly from the Pavilion stage! http://roskilde-festival.dk/,3
Will Bruce be streamed tonight?,0
What a year and it is not even over. But while I remember it.  Try to get these guys over next year.  Best regards   Samuel.,0

Hej  i have a friend who wants to buy a one day ticket for tomorrow. She tried to buy online but it didn't work. If she just comes tomorrow will she be able to buy a ticket? What are the chances that it is sold out?,0
Hi Victoria. I just tried buying a one day ticket for tomorrow and it worked. Can your friend perhaps try again? Can you specify why it wasn't working. I can't say anything about the chances of buying a ticket at the festival tomorrow.,0
Sorry  I'm not sure why it didn't work  just that she got some error every time. I get that you probably don't want to say anything about the chances of getting a ticket :/ but if there ARE tickets available  you can buy them at the entrance right?,0
Per Vers is this year’s host at Orange Stage. Each time he introduces an artist on Orange Stage he will be wearing a different outfit made by a talented graffiti artist Juse One. When he is done presenting on stage  the clothes will be showcased in the graffiti zone and in the Backstage Village. The outfits will be auctioned on Ebay  and all income goes to project headspace.  Read more  and find out how to bid via this link: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/artworkorange,14
Cool idea! - and great choice of project for donation: www.headspace.dk,0

This sunday there is a change in schedule. Unfortunately Gurrumul will not be able to play at Gloria  but we are happy to announce that Peter Broderick  who also played at Roskile in 2009 will be playing instead.,0
We do our best to spread the orange feeling – also internally. Therefore  we have the ‘Hugging Team’  where volunteers can nominate other volunteers they believe deserve a hug. The Hugging Team then comes on an unannounced visit and do what they do best: hug and make people happy. What do you do to make your fellow festival guests feel good?,9

Livestreaming is now available from selected Roskilde Festival 2012 concerts.  Right now you can see and hear the Megaphonic Thrift  as they are performing live at Pavilion. Enjoy! http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/,10

Peter Ib Hansen  remember the sound is a somewhat unmixed stereo signal  meaning you will never get the same sound as the live sound by the stages. But we come as close as we can - which isn't bad at all. But we will gain the sound more.,0
Now we are also streaming live from Christina Rosenvinge - Oficial's concert  which is due in ten minutes (Pavilion 2pm),0
Can Arena and Pavilion Streams be embeded too?,0

In short. From a townplanners vieuw  Roskilde Festival is a fence with two zones of beer consumption. In the inner and the most expensive beerzone there is some raised platforms where audio gifted peoples is fighting a huge struggle to bring the peoples of the zone into a state of extace. Afterwards there is a lot of waste that has to be burned.,0

Oliver Dahl  but Scott Kelly from Neurosis is a part of Corrections House. Give their album  Last City Zero  a spin - it's absolutely excellent.,0
Neurosis is one of my favorite bands but Minsk  Eyehategod and Yakuza are all kick-ass bands to so I am really expecting Corrections House to be something special. Thanks for that booking I have never heard of Correction House before,0
I think I will  Im not saying the band is bad but its not Neurosis.,0
 Last City Zero  is definitely decent  but not excellent. Watching them live is... strange. Sax  guitar  weird samples & roaring. No drums.,0
Neurosis were in Europe last year. In fact  they played in Copenhagen the week before Roskilde Festival last year! If you want to see Neurosis  you absolutely have to go when they come around. Their shows are a rarirty.,0
Charlotte Mai Jacobsen  he was supposed to play in 2011 but had to opt out because of some family circumstances.,0
Sam Renard  somewhere between 3 and 6 July. Can't be more specific atm.,0
Yes  please! I was looking forward to seeing them so much.,0
Mikkel  Ricky's favorite band (The Black Dahlia Murder) are playing Roskilde this year. Looks like we might have to go :P,0
Things are getting heavy this week. We’ll have 3 new acts for you tomorrow at 9.  Here’s a little something to keep you occupied in the meantime...,7
Rage Against the Machine!,0
OMG  it's Rage Against the Machine!!!,0
Isnt the youtube clip from the movie Black Dahlia? Elizabeth Short...,0
James Holden (Live). And what do i win now?,0
Thanks to everyone who tried to figure out what this week’s teaser was all about. A bit difficult this time  it seems. Not least due to the fact that we left out 4 letters by mistake in the Rob Zombie album title (not on purpose  we swear!).  The three acts are Rob Zombie  The Black Dahlia Murder and Corrections House.  Here’s the logic behind it all:  Rob Zombie is represented with the record to the left. The record is meant as an indicator that we’re dealing with a record title. The title is Rob Zombie’s latest album “Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor”. We made that into an anagramme (and left out those four letters by mistake  making it impossible to guess). On the yogurt it says ‘mix it’ - suggesting that you switch around the letters.  For the band The Black Dahlia Murder we’ve used a screen grab of the film “The Black Dahlia” - about the unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short (in 1947) who was referred to as the Black Dahlia. The band took its name from this murder. We thought this one would be a tough one to recognise  especially because none of the main characters are in this shot. Props to Filip Beijer and Rasmus Hvidbjerg Larsen who figured this one out first.  As for Corrections House  we more or less literally turned the album title “Last City Zero” into graphics. The background is a city. On top of this we’ve written the symbols alpha and omega (crossing over the former). Omega symbolises ‘last’. Moreover  we’ve put a microphone in the bottom-right corner  on which we’ve written ‘9’. This refers to Mike IX Williams (notice the middle name) from Eyehategod who’s the vocalist on most of the songs.,0
Morten Kofoed Andersen  Early out of the gate  huh? But  no.,0
maybe one day I get it right  ),0
Roskilde answered  no  to that 5 min ago.,0
Outkast is not heavy hehe. Heavy tomorrow.,0
They must be one of them  but don't see the match,0
Heavy isn't always Heavy Metal  it could be indicating the weight (size) of the names.,0
But it looks like heavy metal/rock. Outkast is hip hop,0
Martin Mariboe Olesen  heavy doesn't refer to size in this case.,0
Black Dahlia Murder are releasing a new album in june as i can see!,0
Ah okay - well i don't mind! Some good headbanger/moshpit-music is never a bad thing (Y),0
Alpha & Omega and ther record is called Bridge 9. https://soundcloud.com/bridge9/alpha-omega-no-rest-no-peace,0
Chr Bering  this is heavier stuff,0
really.... moshpit music... not really a genre is it?,0
Bart Heemskerk  you're in the wrong genre.,0
hey whats up I play moshpit,0
Yeah thats probably it.,0
Had to argue with that guess :),0
Okay Roskilde Team  I never think about your strange Müsli minds again.... but as long as you book such good bands like those then it is okay.,0
How the hell was I supposed to ever figure that out. Your riddles are impossibly difficult! Haha,0
Michael Juul Hagerup  we have very skilled riddle-solvers among our participants. Usually the bands are guessed.,0
They are obviously a lot smarter than me! :D,0
It's like following Batman's logic when he solves riddles in the tv-show from the 60's.,0
Have a great Festival and look out for some free CD's being given out from sound of melbourne records and Not Child Friendly  with love from Melbourne Australia x,0
We hope that you're having a good time and have had the pleasure of listening to some music. Otherwise check out the last three Pavilion Junior concerts from Wednesday. http://roskilde-festival.dk/tv/,3
The sound on the live stream from Arena Stage isn't working. Is this happening for other people  and are RF aware of this problem? :) First year since 2006 I'm not at RF  so I wanna get everything I can at home! ,0
We have some difficulties with the streaming  but we are working as hard as we can to fix it.,0
The audience and the artist had one of those special Roskilde moments at Janelle Monae’s concert at Roskilde Festival 2011.   What’s your special Roskilde moment?   By the way: Re-experience Janelle Monae this year thursday 11.30 p.m. at Arena.,2
L.O.C. and U$O with 'Momentet' last year was epic!,0

Unfortunately  Roskilde Festival has become a synonym with a lot of alcohol  drugs and even deaths over the last few years:((( Sad. But there are great bands performing there.,0
Anna Simon  Have you ever been here? The media doesn't always paint a true picture. Ask anyone who' at the festival.,0
Would any people like to help my dream city project of #StandingRockIsEverywhere come true? I would like to put up a teepee or create a  dome space  with images from all the amazing photographers I met at #StandingRock and create a place to discuss  sustainable futures  and serve tea (if life and my resources allow). Why Roskilde? Because it is STILL my favorite music festival  where people unite to discuss and enjoy life while creating and having conversations around some truly important issues in society  and yeah drink and have fun.  Thank you in advance  if you cannot reach me by messenger : info@naureen.co is me.,0
Hi guys  I hope you're fine! I need help!!!!  I'm from Brazil and I'm going to Europe in June and July for 5 music festivals... I'm having difficulty finding an hostel or hotel there and I'm afraid I will not be able to cancel my trip to your festival... I already have my ticket purchased! Can you help me with indications of hostels and/or hotels in Roskilde  please?  Thank you for your time! Hugs from Brazil! ??,0
There are only a few hotels/hostels in Roskilde. Many will already be booked during the festival. Here are some to check out:  — Danhostel Roskilde — Prindsen — Zleep Hotel Roskilde — Scandic Roskilde — Comwell ROskilde  If those are no-go's  then try looking in Copenhagen. You can get from Copenhagen to Roskilde by train in 25 minutes  so it isn't a long trip to sleep comfy every day. If comfort isn't an issue  you could also do like us mortals and sleep on the camping site. Camping is included in your ticket  but you'll have to buy and bring a tent. Tents can be bought in Copenhagen or Roskilde City. That would also save you a significant amount of money over a hotel.  Have a great festival!,0

The beers won’t be colder than the previous years  but a lot cheaper! 24 Tuborg beer (33 cl): DKK 110 (plus refund) 20 Tuborg Rå (33 cl): DKK 110 (plus refund)  Pre-order your beer and be the champ of the camp when you bring ice-cold Tuborg for the camp.  This year we reduce the price on beer with 35 % in pre-sale and 23 % when you buy at the festival. There is no refund for cans bought outside of Denmark. To reduce waste  however  all cans are collected at the festival. Last year we paid a great sum of money in refund for foreign cans – money we would much rather spend on music  service and charity!  So  for the sake of the environment  go get your beer while they are cold!,398

Roskilde Festival  last year was a real pain getting my pre ordered beers. It took several days before I found out the only place that would let me exchange my vouchers was in P. City center east  and all the other beer points had either issues with their equipment or did not have any knowledge of beer vouchers.  How has this improved for this year? Will I be able to collect them at all beer points and city centers or do I still have to mission it?,0

This year there are five pick up spots placed all over the Festival Campsite...,0
Tuborg Rå is an organic beer...,0
Me too  )),0
figure it out,0
That is what they claimed last year as well,0
But it is also filtered and pasteurized and therefore without any nutrition. And let's not discuss the taste. But yes  it is organic. Organic McDonalds that is.,0
holy moley that's outstanding,0
Organic and unfiltered - rigtig lækker pilsner!,0
Jeg skjønner ikke den setningen... måtte google  The event is known ahead of time to be not possible  therefore by definition in mathematics  the probability is defined to be 0 which means it can never happen. ,0

Fucking yes  the roskilde rebellion boys could be back on!!,0
Haha nice D,0
Klinke Hans Actually  I would prefer to have good beer for free. But I would rather pay for good beer then drink bad beer for free. Maybe there could be room for both generic lagers and freshhopped ales at the festival? Without O'boy please.,0

Ooh lala ??How you refund the beers? I don't understand,0
It's like they've heard we don't fancy it,0
Recycling---- but the line is a million hours long so usually only the pro recycling ppl have the patience for that,0

WE LOVE YOU ROSKILDE,0
Read the full post and you will see :),0
lets do it!!,0
This offer is only valid at the campsite. We don't experience the same hassle with garbage at the festival site. But at the same time we're cheaper than other venues and festivals in Denmark  so we'll give you a reasonable price.,0
See the percentage in the text :-),0
That's the best argument for going this year!,0
all in yes,0
If I wasn't in France  I'd go  just book the quiet zone this time or turn up on time.,0
Roskilde Festival Prices for everything is reasonable at Roskilde.  Those who complain should attend Coachella.  3 days will cost you over $1000,0
No badger,0
It just gets better haha,0

HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants! #RF15  Robert is from Poland and it is his first time at the festival  maybe you can help him?    I was supposed to go with a couple of friends but they stood me up  so I decided to go on my own. In the queue I got some new friends and was invited to set up my tent at their camp. After partying all night  I couldn't find my new friends or my tent! It's been 3 days and I still can't find my tent but I am having an awesome time at Roskilde! ,24
Haha Robert - you can't find your tent because it was stolen or because you can't remember where you put it? :),0
That's how we roll!  ],0
He is all alone,0
Robert is one of the coolest and funniest guys i've met  anyone who meets him should invite him to join their camp! I promise you  you won't get bored :D,0
Glad you decided to go anyway. I've been to two Roskildes solo  and managed to meet people and have a blast anyway!   Maybe you should try to trace your footsteps from when you arrived -if you identify which gate you came in  you might be able to find the correct camping area. And it shouldn't take TOO long of walking up and down the rows of one area to locate your tent.  Good luck!,0
wont get better roskilde moment than getting lost  :),0
What's with the propeller on your cap  or is it - by any chance - some kind of homing-antennae :-D,0
 I've been lost for three days but I have the time of my life.  Roskilde!,0
He's too big for handing over the desk at the lost and found office  methinks...,0
Here it is :) thank your all for you help :),0
Hahahahah  co za spoko mordeczka -) zapraszamy do polskiej grupki ),0

He's one of the electronic musicians that you can't take your eyes off.  KiNK insists on building his live tracks by hand. He fiddles with panels  knobs and buttons  and ultimately he delivers live electronic music with the kind of showmanship it deserves.

Hey Roskilde. Nice to see you again. Thank you for the new stage Apollo. It's awesome. But why did you place it outside the festival area? There is no way we can walk back and forth then to see other names at other stages and be part of the festival. Seems odd?!!!,0
Apollo is an experiment. We - or anybody else - have never tried something like it before. We greatly appreciate your feedback! But try going west from Odeon  following the paved road to Appolo. Back in the stoneage  we actually had permanent stages (yellow and red) there...,0

Yesterday we announced Jambinai from South Korea. They play post-rock using ancient instruments. That doesn't mean they can't make any noise.  Who knows what these instruments are called?,25
one is a guitar.....,0
i'd like to have an ancient electric guitar!,0
From the strange  demanding corners of this year's line-up. We announce:   FIRE Orchestra (rocking free jazz ensemble with 30 musicians)  Jambinai (disturbing postrock from the East)  Blood on a Feather (abstract  psychedelic folk music)  WIN TICKETS TO FIRE!

HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - Frederik & Sofie   To me  Roskilde is all about love. Love for people and music  but especially love for the girl I love. So I thought  what better place to propose than the place where I asked her to be my girlfriend. That was three years ago. I proposed to her today at the Benal concert. I know the guys from high school  so they let me come up on the stage. When I yelled  What's up  Roskilde   the crowd went crazy. When I got down on my knees and asked her to marry me  they went even more crazy. Luckily  she said yes.  Frederik  29.  When he asked whether I would marry him  I started crying. I said yes  as loud as I could  but I was not sure if people could hear me. Then the crowd lifted me up  and I just nodded and nodded.  Sofie  27.  For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. This is a story from some of our inhabitants!,43

thats all i need to know. thanks guys. love and groove!  ),0
Our amazing volunteer  photographer Jens Juul  has won the Danish Press Photo of the Year (Kategori Åben Klasse) for a series of photos he developed for Orange Press in 2016. The idea behind the series was to create raw and unpolished portraits of festival-goers in their temporary homes in the city of Roskilde Festival. Well done Jens!,34
 raw and unpolished portraits of festival-goers  -- seems to me like it would be more appropriate to describe it as:  raw and unpolished portraits of female-festival-goers .  Was the point to draw a general picture of festival-goers? Or are we missing some context for the series here? Is there a link to the series of portraits somewhere? Thanks! :),0
So he basically took the usual pics of tits and crouches and objectifies women.. How original. 'Sell it with sex(ism)'. So un original.,0
Hi Lukas. You're exactly right. This is only a selection of pictures from the series. The reason we posted these are because these are the ones  he won the press photo award for. You can see the pictures in Orange Press here: roskil.de/orangepress and here are a couple og Jens' pics featuring male festival-goers.,0
Thanks for providing some context  the original selection of images didn't show too much diversity.  The series seems great and interesting!,0
To be fair  it's not the photographer but rather the selection made by the  Danish Press Photo of the Year . Roskilde Festival provided some more diverse images in reply to my comment above. I do find it suspicious that every image selected by that particular award is.. Well unfortunately one-sided. But the photographer doesn't seem to have been actively objectifying women.  Also Alexandra Hou says hi!,0
I have no issue with women being portrayed or given lots of space in the context. That's good. It's the way he portrayed them I have an issue with. Say hi back! ??,0
Karin Jakobsson Read the reply to Lukas further up the page. There were men portrayed in the complete series as well  however this handful were the ones the jury awarded. That's why these were the ones that were posted.,0

How about an excuse to strip-search your new found friend  or a possibility to explore the outskirts of the festival – lead by the roll of a dice? We made the dice and you invented the rules  now it is time to find the merchandise shop and let the good times roll! With Roskilde Festival – The Dice Game you get 100 different games all in one festival dice kit. All of the different games have been created by our lovely guests  and the top four inventers have won a festival ticket. Remember The Dice Man? He would have loved this!,1

A throne fit for a queen.  Elza Soares is known as the queen of avant-garde samba. Through her art and fight against social injustice she is rightly viewed as an icon in South America.

Roskilde Festival 2017 will be cashless!  ...and everything is quite simple:   - if you already use a credit card  keep using it. - if you don't have a credit card or simply prefer to arrive with cash  you can transfer it to a cash card that you can use everywhere at the festival site.  Here's a Q&A: Q: Can I bring euros (or any other non-Danish currency) to put on my cash card?  A: Yes. We accept the following currencies: DKK  EUR  NOK  SEK  GBP  USD.   Q: I don’t have a credit card. How can I buy beer and food? A: You can transfer your cash to a cash card that you can use all over the festival  Q: I’m under 18. Can I still get a cash card? A: Sure thing  buddy!  Q: What happens if I lose my cash card?  A: As long as you register your cash card using your name  you can cancel your card.,66
Is it require a pin? What happens i you lose the pin? What if there is cash left on the card after the festival?,0
Is it going to be absolutely cashless at the festival or will it end up being like Hellfest where I topped up €100 and it ended up only being for beer?,0
No problem. I'm always cashless at the festival   ),0
Can I use my italian prepaid card? Will cash card be incorportate in the bracelet?,0
Laura Sofie Pallesen why?,0
Will your cards have contactless payment?,0
Anyone else disliking this idea or am i so boring?,0
What about all the independent stalls all over the festivalground? Grandstand etc.?,0
lollapalooza berlin went cashless in 2015 with bombastic announcements and in 2016 returned to cash.. cashless festival is really really not a good idea..,0
Not anymore you don't! The king is dead! All hail the cash card!,0
And when the system crashes like it did two years ago and only cash were accepted?,0
Now it's a real consumer party Thomas Nikolaj Frederik,0
Sometimes i used to buy a Beer from somebody on the Campsite when my Beercan just ran out... How does that should work without cash??,0
I spent the whole festival last year cashless!,0
What about mobilepay? It is also cashless  can it still be used?,0
How will 7 stations to get a card go with 100.000 people? Won't there be people who'll have to go without food and drinks way longer than others?,0
Do you think 7 charging stations will be enough for the whole festival? How are you going to make sure people don't have to wait in line for 3 hours everytime they want to charge a card? It really sounds like a very small amount for such big festival. If I run out of money on my card but want to buy something in one of the shops/stalls and there is a huge line to recharge  could I still pay in cash instead of wasting my time in waiting lines and missing half the festival?,0
Will it maybe be possible to get the cash card at same time and place as you pick up your wristband as a Volunteer??,0
Eskil Buchardt damn that's actually a great idea,0
So cash not accepted?? Only that card or creditcard?,0
What about drugs? They still all about the cash right?,0
Not a fan of this at all. I live in Ireland  where cash thankfully can be used everywhere. I find it very cumbersome when I go to a gig or festival on mainland Europe where the staff are all smug and excited about their unique token or card system that works there and there only. Seems to me going backwards rather than forwards.,0
and anneliless ??,0
It is crazy that in the currencies that you will accept one of the is DKK.  That is silly.  Who at Roskilde would have that kind of cash?   )  But I think this is brilliant.,0
Have only used card the last few year  and only time i had a problem with this was when I wanted to catch one of the buses in to copenhagen. Will these now start accepting cards as well?,0
why is there no other choice? it seems forced and I dislike that,0
Its all clear explained  why so much questions!!,0
would you guys also accept CAD? i might have EUR but i'm not sure yet so i'd rather keep my money in CAD just in case,0
The thing all non-Danes are most concerned with: will you still punish non-Danes by adding a pathetic 3% or so to all foreigners cards? The so called  welcome to Denmark-tax  or  why does not the rest of the world use Dankort-tax ?,0
been to 6 or seven festivals ( melt  best kept secret  primavera  ) that use it  never had problems with it. They tended to be a rfid chip on a wristband doubling as the entrance ticket. Rarely had to queue. I think creditcard at Roskilde worked well enough  but the risk of losing it is bigger than having something that merely has value for a limited amount of time.,0
I think festival is a place for free soul. Cash is limitless. Festivelers are bounded and forced to do what they don't want is so not festival like.,0
Ria Grahl Here it is....,0

I see that Denmark's pride  the wonderful Agnes Obel  is out touring and selling out everywhere. Surely its time for her to play Roskilde. Please do try and book her! She's wonderful (but you already knew that).,0
Roskilde Festival Did you book Neil Young ? ,0
It's been twenty years since crazy influential alternative punkerockers NoMeansNo(Ca) rocked Orange stage following Sepultura and Peter Gabriel. Maybe it's time for the jolly canadians behind the all time punk classic Wrong  to return to Roskilde Festival? ,0

has a few full-week tickets left  but expects them to sell out before thursday morning. Handfulls of one-day tickets for thursday  friday and sunday. You better hurry...,3
its a bit costly for not a very good line up at all.,0
No  it's a bargain for a week of that Orange Feeling! Plus  The Roots are worth the ticketprice alone. :),0
Line up is garbage - especially in a year when there is no competition from glastonbury,0
Roskilde and Glastonbury wasnt in competition anyhow!,0
If i dont get my passport today I need to sell mine please- my husband is there already  so if anyone would like to buy it off him at Roskilde ?,0
we usually get the ticket in the mail  but theres no time for that now.. is it possible to pick it up at the camp site in stead?,0
All-week tickets can be bought online. Then bring your printed receipt to the entrance  where we'll exchange it for a wristband. We generally urge the audience to buy tickets online before going here. It would be a b#### to go to Roskilde only to find the tickets sold out. And we're almost there...,0

Really? What a shame….Guess I have to be my own headliner running in the naked race on Saturday then...,0
We despart need some toilets on the small Caravan CampSite.. There's a really long walk to the nearest by the  Rent a Tent  and the Big Caravan Campsite. Please hurry up,0
Please talk to the service guards in the area. They should be able to help or answer any inquiries.,0
You can get your wristband at the entrance at camping East (Vor Frue Hovedgade) and camping West (Darupvej). Maybe this map can be useful: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2012/map/map-2012-uk.pdf,0
“NO  YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND CONCERTS OR TO SING IN PUBLIC PLACES”  Today is music freedom day. And it’s about the celebration and protection of women’s voices.  Freemuse is an organisation who advocates freedom of expression for musicians. This year they focus on women rights to perform in public places or even attend concerts.   Roskilde Festival supports Freemuse’s fight for equality.  At Roskilde 2017 you can engage in debates about women’s right to perform music  hosted by Freemuse.,18
We’ve added 24 new acts to the Roskilde Festival 2017 line-up  including Father John Misty  Bonobo  Popcaan  Tinashe and Sort Sol (Official Site).  94 out of 175 acts announced so far. Check out the line-up and get your ticket on www.roskilde-festival.dk,187

Jenny Wilson will play Roskilde Festival. She’s added to the 2014 line-up along with Hymns from Nineveh and Bombus.  Three acts added to a line-up already consisting of acts such as Arctic Monkeys  Major Lazer  Trentemøller and 10 more. We’ll end up with 160 acts.  See band list: http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/bands,20
Urging for something hard-hitting at Roskilde 2014? Try Bombus from Gothenburg  Sweden.  Bombus plays muscular heavy rock  proudly inspired by the legends of the 70s and 80s.  Earlier we also announced Hymns from Nineveh.  At 13:00 we’ll announce today’s final act.,26
It's a bumble bee und you showed us a bee  you nerds! I thought about many things like honey  bee  beez  swarm  beehive... but never a bumble bee. I am a zoologist. What a shame. :-),0
Since you are booking bands that are not that famous or well known  you could take a look at Norwegian Stoner Legends  Thulsa Doom. Thulsa Doom Norway Recent comeback to rave reviews and sold out shows in Norway. One of the bands Roskilde never managed to book. Go get em!,0
Would have helped A LOT if it was a bumble bee...,0
Haha  sorry Oliver Kissling that we weren't specific about it.,0
I second this!,0

We are working around the clock to prepare the festival site for the grand opening on Thursday. Every detail matters just like these Happy City Birds  which can be found near Orange. We do this because we think you are awesome. So we hope you still have some energy left on Thursday?,5
I hate the word awesome  and resent being called awesome.,0
Happy City Birds.. near Orange... How about Deaf Happy City Birds? :-D,0
Roskilde Festival has everything I love! <3,0
Love the  don't-piss-on-me tree defenders ,0
Not sure they'll work though,0
If they live near Orange Stage  I understand why all the Happy Birds turned into Angry Birds!,0

Ingrid Kruse this moment at 11 seconds!!,0
At 5-7000 facebook likes like the hint states? Nope.,0
Hi Anders.I am not sure what you mean.,0
They've stated that the announcements today have between 5000 and 7000 Facebook likes each. Even when you're considering that they're Scandinavian names  that's low. So don't expect any big names among these :-) – expect smallish names but great stuff instead.,0
Hymns From Nineveh for example has 6800 likes on here  so it's likely that they're the most  famous  act of the bunch.,0
Bombus is nice.Very typical Roskildeact.Trendy band.Hoping for more classic stuff though,0
Yeah  Bombus was a nice surprise.,0
Hymns from Nineveh will play Roskilde 2014.  Beautiful spiritual folk pop with catchy tunes.  At 11:00 we’re back with announcement 2 out of 3.,25
When's the next headliner announcement?  We need someone like Daft Punk  The Prodigy  Rage Against the Machine  Eminem  Lauryn Hill  Outkast,0
Yeah true  I'm sure you have it all under control,0
Chris Coleby  too early to say. With 160 acts in the line-up we have so much more than just headliners to announce.,0
Chris Coleby  we're trying  as always :-),0
No.,0
I need none of those.,0

Hi.. Would there be live streams this year? I mean  is there any lifelines for the unlucky ones that are caught at work  abroad  in the rain  with no snøfler  no beer and no #RF15..!!!!,0
Do you need to get the Roskilde Festival wristband  before checking in at get-a-tent-central?,0
Look at that weather forecast. Summer is coming!  All ticket prices change to ‘door price’ from midnight between Tuesday and Wednesday. One-day tickets will cost 1050 DKK + fee. If you buy before Tuesday at midnight  it's 980 DKK + fee.,13
Are last year's Volt chargers exchangeable at this year's festival?,0

Where is the best chance to find available camping area? I am arriving in a few hours. ,0
If it's just one tent  there should be room like  anywhere. If you're an entire camp of tents  try the farthest corners of the camping site.,0
I've been trying to buy a ticket for the last 24 hours. Any idea when the payment issues will be resolved? ,0
It's a Scandinavia-wide payment issue that affects almost all internet trade  because they use DIBS. More info here: http://politiken.dk/tjek/digitalt/internet/ECE1677511/nedbrud-paa-nettet-stopper-for-betalinger/  You can always buy a ticket at the entrance  if it isn't sold out.,0

My leg's been shaking since Sturgill last year so that won't be a problem ????,0
I tried to like it   =(,0
Did you know that midnight oil will be in the neighbourhood around RF17?????,0
We have bad news. The Swedish hardcore punk band Beyond Pink is forced to cancel its concert at Roskilde Festival. A band member is struck down with an illness. The Danish hardcore act Ruined steps in instead.,25
That's a good question. Don't know the answer to it  though.,0
That's right  we're putting the good ol' ciname on stand-by for now. We want to develop the cinema - it has more or less looked the same for twenty years. We tried to develop it in 2013 by making it an open-air theatre  but unfortunately it didn't really attract that many people. So  until we know what to do with the cinema  we're putting it on hold for now.  On Thursday you can read more about what we're saying hello and goodbye to in 2014.,0
wtf  there were people enough the first days  at least keep it sunday-thursday,0
When it is possible to apply to work as volunteers for the 2014 festival?,0
Don't have the exact dates yet  but it's typically sometime in spring. We'll keep you posted.,0
The festival will be awesome this year if you can bring Rage Against The Machine while they are still together.. I think lots of demand for them to play already!,0
I wish they could! :),0
I think they've been trying for almost a decade or so.,0
A new year calls for new announcements.  We have a few acts for you tomorrow.  Here's a clue...,16
The Beatles,0
Celebrity deathmatch on Orange stage?  ),0
As always absolutely impossible this... Anyone ever gotten it right?,0
Thanks for all the guesses (some more qualified than others).   Thomas Maagaard  you guessed Jenny Wilson. Thomas Balslev Rosenzweig  you guessed Hymns from Nineveh. Nice going. No one guessed Bombus - too difficult  perhaps?  Here’s a walk-through...  The two flags (one Swedish  one Danish) shows the nationalities of our three bands. The numbers in the upper-left corner and button-right corners indicate the numer of acts. At the very bottom you can the approximate amount of Facebook page likes.  You find three symbols  each one representing one act:  The stars – on the cover of Jenny Wilson’s latest album “Demand the Impossible!” we see her face split in two halves  one half consists of a starry sky. That’s your clue here. The bee – Bombus is Latin for bee – more specifically  genus bombus means bumble bee. The eye – Hymns from Nineveh’s latest album is called ”Visions”  and at the centre of the front cover you can see an eye illustration pointing to other symbols.,0
Reason: She's Swedish. ~5.6k likes. The cover of her latest album ( Demand the Impossible ) features both stars and an eye (and one eye replaced by a star).,0
Hope you´re right about that,0
Me too :),0
And the Danish flag?,0
No clue. If I'm right about this  then I'd suspect the Danish artist has cover art involving a fly/wasp/bee on his/her/their latest release. And likes >6k but <7k.,0
But I obviously could be wrong about Jenny Wilson.,0
go home norway  you're drunk,0
Jenny Wilson's a certain. I don't think she's related to the eye part of the clue though. Neither do I think the insect is related to tomorrow's Danish artist  it's related to a second Swedish  I believe.,0
i don't think it is kent.  clue says 5-7k likes of facebook,0
They aren´t swedish...,0
Rickard Torstenfelt  someone usually nails it.,0
Absolut! :D,0
Hey! I actually guessed Hymns From Nineveh before Thomas Balslev Rosenzweig did: http://tinyurl.com/ph88tbz http://tinyurl.com/p99lw2z Just saying like.,0
Sorry Thomas Maagaard  we tried our best to give proper credit :-),0
No worries. I'm merely procrastinating here :),0
Daniel Clatza  turn that frown upside down :-),0
Love Eriksson  the cat's already out of the bag. See our long comment about the answer to the teaser elsewhere in this thread.,0
Husk pudekampen i aften! Det kommer til at foregå i K43  på Bakken... Vi starter omkring kl 21... Kom glad og leg med...  Remember the pollowfight this evening!! We're located at K43  on the hill... We'll start around 9 o'clock... Come and play with us...,0
More acts soon  ?,0
Won't be too long...,0

Hi  i got ticket to Roskilde Festival 2014 and what Entrance can i use the ticket :) ? I hope on the West :),0

Music? You want music? Well  we'll cook up something this week.,0
Godbye gravelpit this is the end,0

Roskilde Festival is happy to announce another intriguing and unique event during warm-up: Spleen United will perform a 24 hour improvised live performance called  From Sunset to Sunset . From 10 p.m. Tuesday 3 July to 10 p.m. 4 July the Danish synth poppers treat Roskilde Festival’s audience with a tour de force of pure electronic bliss. The marathon show will take place at the camping site by the swimming lake at Agora K. In the night time we will provide the audience with headphones  Silent Disco-style  a large digital clock in the center will be counting the hours during this epic performance. Don’t miss one of Denmark’s most exciting bands giving a demonstration of pure musical stamina and dedication.,9
Tickets cost a little extra at the entrances. It's often the same thing when you go to concerts. See it an incentive to buy your ticket from home (in ample time).,0
Thanks for the answer - however it would be appropriate to let people buy ticket at the internet price when paying is not possible because of a breakdown - also announce on the internet the price of tickets on your website please - anyway there was such a good spirit in roskilde that I was tempted to follow my son inside - despite all the trouble - HAVE A NICE FESTIVAL!!,0
Hi all. I speak from Brazil and I wonder if there will be broadcast by streaming  the show of  OQuadro  band  on 04 July. I'm waiting for an answer.  Thank you.,0
Hi Bruno We can't say what bands are gonna be livestreamed yet. But keep an eye out on our Facebook and website and we will announce it there,0
Hej Jakob  thanks for contacting us. You can drop it off at the Lost & Found  located near the Apollo stage.,0
http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/acdc-confirm-tour-2014-6461266 Please book AC/DC to Roskilde this summer :),0

--> Rodrigo y Gabriela,0
I'm looking all over the billet net website where I submit my second payment for flex pay  but I can't find it. Can you dear roskilde-people please help me.,0
It's may not be too logical  but you have to go to ticketmaster.dk and log in with your e-mail and password (used when you made your first payment). On your profile page you can pay the next instalment(s).,0
Still can't find it  I may be just stupid. But I'm clicking at My Account. Well there There are four sub-genres: Edit Profile  Edit Address  VIew Orders and Newsletters. The logical in me says that it should be under VIew orders  but well there I can only find order history  and click on the order number for detailed information. The second subment(s) I can't find anywhere!,0
Have a look at this help text. Hopefully it'll help you: http://www.billetnet.dk/event/roskilde-festival-2014-flexpay-Billetter/374453,0
So  if I get the text right. I´m supposed to get into order a new ticket  and choose to select payments for a new one. That sounds a bit logical  but just want to make sure I don't order a new ticket with X payments when paying for the  new  ticket!?,0
Linton Skanshed  sorry  we misinformed you to begin with. You actually have to pay the next rates by going to roskilde-festival.dk/ticket/ and clicking Flexpay. It seems like a new purchase but they all rates will be connected. Under my orders you can always see how much you've paid.,0
Thank you!,0

Rising is Roskilde Festival's new area for creative activism  where you can come to learn how we can make the world a better place together. Each day starts with a communal breakfast in the Conversation Salon  and ends with first showings of CPH:DOX films  such as  Banksy Does New York .   In the words of Kitte Wagner  programme coordinator for Rising   We might even take over the Danish Parliament one day  and that is a beautiful vision . However  it's not all about politics  this evening there will be live-tweeting from Roskilde Festival's twitter account from the Orgasm Workshop 20.30 to 21.40.

Daft Punk is most likely not touring. SOAD are playing another Danish festival  so they're not an option.,0
They are up for sale already. But when you're probably wondering more about is what DAY these fellows will play  right? We'll release the day-by-day programme in March/April.,0
Roskilde Festival let us know asap. I don't want to buy a ticket and then it ends up not being the date that ATCQ are playing. know what I mean. aight peace,0

We sure do. We recommend that you send an e-mail to volunteer@roskilde-festival.dk. There are some very nice people there who'll help you out.,0
Thanks to all volunteers and festival-goers who took part in Roskilde Festival 2016. It’s because of you that we’re able to donate 1 million DKK to Danmarks Indsamling today.  We’re very happy to be able to support the continuous effort to improve the living standards of some of the poorest people in the world. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of Danmarks Indsamling and thanks to all of you guys we’ve been able to donate more than 7 6 million DKK over the last ten years. Thank you!   We are #RF17,64

Meet Freja. Freja is part of the Roskilde team working with social responsibility and donations. In December she visited Madagascar - one of the poorest countries in the world. As you can see it was a very emotional experience.  Her visit was a part of UNICEF's project to help starving and malnourished children in the poorest parts of the world. A project we're supporting through our donation to Danmarks Indsamling.  You can also support this cause by giving a donation to Danmarks Indsamling right here: www.danmarksindsamling.dk,40
RF  why do you allow an exclusive ticket sales to be handles by Livenation/TicketMaster? For me  Roskilde stands for something different than this huge monopolistic Beverly Hills company  so it seems unneccesary that I should pay 1 25% of the ticket price to them. I'm sure there are better alternatives.  Some of you say  oh that's only small money  but that's so untrue. With 100.000 sold ticket  we're putting 2 5M kr. into the pockets of LiveNation. On a good year  RF makes a profit of around 15M kr.  so that's 16% of the profit in the pockets of LiveNation. Roskilde Festival  you can do better than that.,0
When choosing a ticket operator we have a number of demands that only few operators are able to meet. This includes having an efficient reporting system built on one database  having international reach and of course being secure and trustworthy.  We can't do it ourselves  so we need an external supplier. We are in contact with different operators from time to time  and the best solution atm comes from Ticketmaster  which is why we use them. Besides taking care of the sale (including insurance issues when stolen cards are used) they supply with personnel onsite at Roskilde Festival  handle a call centre and more  which is why it's only natural that they charge for their service. We can't go into details of our agreement but our assessment is that it's a really good deal.,0
well thank you for replying to these posts that often disappear in the noise. Since you can't go into details about it  there is no discussion if the deal is good or not. I'm just saying that it's way out of sync with RF values. Famous artists that have played your stages such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam has been very outspoken about the ugly face of TicketMaster.,0
We're still pretty f****** excited about this!   How about you?,26

The Roskilde Festival 2017 line-up is really beginning to take shape. 70 out of 175 acts announced!   Who are you most excited about so far?,48
foo fighters  Lumineers  Erasure  Lorde  the weekend  and Rag'N'Bone Man...  possible more acts  because I might have forgotten some acts which I am looking forward to??????,0
Most excited about Bonobo and Gorillaz  whether they'll be announced or not!,0
How can Blink-182 not be in the largest font?,0
This line up is shaping up nicely. Very nicely! So many acts I am looking forward to. And we are not even half way the full line up yet!,0
foo fighters  arcade fire  kellermensch  the weeknd  a tribe called quest  blink-182  gucci mane  rag'n'bone man  lorde  against me!  red fang og arv arv arv :),0

The one and only Foo Fighters! ????,0
Atomikylä and Margo Price.,0
Arcade Fire. Thats it. Other than that  the whole experience.,0
All bull shit music  WHERE IS REAL ROCK AND ROLL ?????,0
I wonder how many more headliners will be announced...,0
Neurosis & High on Fire ??,0
A tribe called quest,0
I'm REALLY looking forward to see Daft Punk this year????????????,0
When is the mobile app going to update artist?,0
Eva Wittkuhn oh no,0
Actually I think we should definitely do this one Claire Neyle,0
Still waiting for bands/acts where I know more than just 1-3 songs.  ),0
Just Foo Fighters. ..,0
Neurosis and High on Fire. The rest of the current line up is pretty weak...,0
But where's that major superstar? ??????,0
Sara Appel the weeknd ??,0
Hannibal Najbjerg Hansen Josefine Najbjerg Hansen Anders Tørnqvist Overgaard Blink 182!? A Tribe Callef Quest AND GUCCI MANE!? Ya'll have to be going! Get your tickets yet!?,0
Arcade Fire. The best band in the world!!!,0
Kellermensch  Red Fang  Of Mice & Men  Foo Fighters  High On Fire and that's about it.,0
BLACK STRING is the best!!,0
I'm most excited about Daft Punk!! The 2017 Tour is going to be awesome! Especially now that they are coming to the greatest festival there is. Roskilde Festival that is!?? ????,0
More grime and more Norwegian rapppers pleaaasee <3,0
Julie Nitke we have to go! ??,0
Where is Asian and African music represented? I'm talking about the music that every day Africans and Asians actually listen to. If you are talking about diversity  show it! I'm a little tired of second rank Danish and American bands that I wouldn't even go to watch in Copenhagen if they played for free.,0
Get neurosis to copenhell.,0
få Stig Of The Dump til at komme!!!! please!!!,0
Sammy O'Regan g-eazy and the weeknd ??,0
Neurosis  Red Fang and Viagra Boys. It´s going to be the best Festival ever. Arcade Fire is OK aswell...What about Steven Tyler and friends. They are on their last Tour ever,0
what day is blink 182 playing?,0
Izzy this one or park life in Manchester look great too,0
Nobody. Terrible lineup this year.,0
because they are not that big.,0
Blink-182 is bigger than some of the big headlines so that's just not true. I'm not sure how they determine it tbh,0
Fedeste line up,0
Alexis Mihalitsis They were frickin huge and will still attract a big crowd here. (Not that I am a big fan *cough) It was always going to be hard for them to keep up the skater-boy routine in their 40s though I suppose.,0
oh my gooood,0
Its a contract thing,0
Christian  you're beautiful ,0
And Solange  Vanishing Twin  Justice and Jenny Hval????,0
Alexis Mihalitsis are u telling me The weeknd is bigger than blink 182? ????,0
no worries neary all coming to sonar,0
Perhaps if Tom DeLonge was still in the band. But he's not.  ),0
Oh lord I really want to! Need to have a festival meeting ASAP,0
Agreed. Shall we chat before zak abel? Will put a list together this week,0
for a second there you had me believe that bonobo had been announced... that'd be fuckin' awesome... and still possible seeing as he's playing in the netherlands sometime between the 23. and 25. of june and then rock werchter the 1. july,0
i knew you would like <3,0
Yes sounds great! Love your work,0
As much as the weeknd isn't my kind of thing  he's more relevant right now than Blink. Don't get me wrong  I've always been a fan  but for me a headliner needs to either be current  or a real classic.,0
Just get to know more than 1-3 songs!,0
Why don't you go to a metal festival instead if that's all you care about?,0
Rufus and Møme sound exactly the same. It's nothing wrong with them  but nthing special either. Justice on top of the bill? Maybe in 2007-8.,0
I was actually just going to go for a one-day ticket for Blink 182  but I might have to rethink that :D I think Hannibal is going for the whole week tho.. You should come over Casey! One week before this we've got the Copenhell festival with System of a Down!,0
It's not all I care about  but nothing else on the current roster does anything for me.,0
Besides  metal festivals are weak as fuck.,0
its not over young one,0
no tickets,0
Bjørn Rydemark SHIT GUCCI MANE!? O M FUCKING G!!!!!,0
I just wanna go to streak,0
105 more acts to go,0
Liam Cross Blink-182 are a classic. They pioneered pop-punk. Spawned a million bands in that genre so are still quite relevant in my opinion. Arguably the most influential pop-punk band ever.,0
Daft Punk is not coming...,0
the weeknd!!,0
Easy does it. We're not quite done yet announcing  but currently the following non-western countries are represented: Palestine (now  that's a discussion-starter)  South Africa and Colombia. More is on its way. If we're lucky we'll get acts from Sudan  Brazil  Western Sahara  Morocco  Senegal  Tunisia and Jamaica.,0
Roskilde Festival Alright  looking forward to those announcements (although I don't see anythin Asian in there?) Yes  indeed: There are good reasons why Denmark along with almost all other western countries don't recognize Palestine  so why even start this debate and go all political here...sigh,0
Korea is also represented with Black String  albeit it's classical music.,0
Kjartan  that's good. I didn't spot them. I've seen Korean avantgarde on RF before.. However  I don't know why every time music from Africa and Asia is represented it has to be these obscure genres and bands that noone is their home countries would know. There's so much great music made in Africa and Asia that never makes it to European festivals (just look on YouTube)  and I wish that I could see some of it on RF.,0
I'm going to buy a ticket. But I don't know if I want to go just for the music. Or for the whole thing,0
How much is a ticket? A tribe called quest & the weeknd would be amazing,0
There about 200. Or around there. It's 8 days,0
https://youtu.be/x34icYC8zA0,0
The weeknd! Lorde!,0
Oh Kano too. Stahp.,0
If The Weeknd is not a superstar  I don't know who is. Unless you're referring to the older names like how Stevie Wonder  The Rolling Stones  Paul McCartney and Neil Young have filled that spot in the past.,0
I don't wanna be that guy  but Palestine is in Asia.,0
Omg ??... I will actually die ...,0
oh no ??,0
We'll reveal day-by-day programmes later in the season. Expectedly in March/April,0

Yeah yeah I am Lorde,0
Spotify's my only reference point since I've never heard of them before. Guess I'll need to check them out live. And of course the  good bands  was just a provocation  ) But like I said  poorly represented.,0
Meh I'm actually not too fussed. But I think it's more the disappointment of not getting a big rock name,0
Where do I get my ticket,0
Yep. So much,0
Dont be dishonest,0
Thanks for the tip. This time around we've booked Rüfüs  which you have probably noticed already.,0

Decorating the Xmas tree the orange way.  Got any Roskilde decorations? Let's see them.  Photo: Ivo Kircheis,11
After the 2005 festival  I rebuild Foo Fighters legendary gig at the orange stage in gingerbread.  http://images.hacka.net/ff.png,0
I want them also back to Roskilde  too many years since they played last time at Roskilde.,0
Isn't it time for Roskilde to welcome Mumford and Sons to play orange tones?? ,0
We've had 42 stages since 1971 (including the two new ones).  Do you have a favourite?  Hi-res version (pdf): http://ow.ly/rQeKy,15
Sorry to say  but... Cosmopol. Still looking forward to next summer  190 to go!! Systema Solar was a great booking!,0
So it's only Pavilion Junior  that gets killed off next season  not the real Pavilion?,0
In 2004 Ballroom had such great world music line-up that I practically lived there. I have always liked Pavillion too.,0
Yep. Pavilion prevails  while the Roskilde Rising bands play on a stage now named after the initiative.,0
Same same but different!,0
If you are at the festival  there are helpdesks at the entrances  if not please contact Billetnet -http://www.billetnet.dk/help/kontakt.html?l=en-us&tm_link=tm_i_2&language=en-us,0
foster the people on roskilde 2014 ,0
Major Lazer has accepted the challenge of starting a BIG party at Roskilde Festival 2014.  We also announce: Systema Solar and Mark Ernestus presents Jeri-Jeri. Both will add some global colours to our line-up.  We've got much more coming in 2014. We'll end up with 160 acts in the line-up.,307
Major Lazer and Mø collaboration?,0
Never heard of any of these. Maybe im getting too old for Roskilde,0
Roskilde Festival  if you want to go pop,0
When I started my journy at RF it was mainly rock... Now I think it is mainly pop :-(,0
Mikkel Neubert  one can only hope  but that's up to them.,0
Christian Stougaard Andersen  what Mikkel Neubert said.,0
Mattias Svensson  tha'ts just a matter of GETTING TO KNOW them  right?,0
Martin van Dijk  we want to go in many directions - like we ALWAYS do.,0
Jacob X Jensen  that announcement also contains two other acts. They don't swing by that often. Check them out!,0
Probably but im not into pop or electronic music. Nothing so far is worth buying a ticket for imho.,0
But still  I remember when you guys where the firstmovers... what happened to all that ?,0
A big thing for ME about Roskilde Festival is going home with at least 20 new artists you've never heard of before but will definitely follow you for at least the rest of the year and many of'them long time after.,0
Martin van Dijk  that's not true. We have LOADS of rock every year. BUT we also present loads of other stuff. We don't want to be just a rock festival.,0
Jacob X Jensen  check out the lower part of our poster every year. That first-moving stuff for ya. Many of those acts grow to play bigger stages years later.,0
To be fair  Major Lazer already played at Roskilde five years ago. How's that for first movers?,0
Jonas Binder Porsborg  that's right. Orange it is!,0
Roskilde begun taking dance music seriously in 1995 with the Deeday stage  so it's kinda old news  -),0
Perhaps it's because it's a different genre than your type?,0
And retards will blindly follow  ),0
Carcass and nails and maybe arctic monkeys is something Id watch but I need a lot more to go out and buy a ticket. Its still early though.,0
No name-calling  alright?,0
It's pure xmas spirit  ) no worries,0
Roskilde has booked Arctic Monkeys ffs! The biggest rockband of this generation who actually plays electric guitars!,0
If every act on Roskilde was new and groundbreaking  they wouldn't sell enough tickets. Blame an ignorant music culture for that  not the festival.,0
I'd still buy a ticket if they calcelled all the music tbh.,0
Simone Slot (y),0
Maybe you are.,0
When you want to sell tickets  you sometimes have to give people  what they want  and the announcement have already gotten more likes than all but four announcements last year  so it seems this is what a lot of people want at RF.,0
i think a majority of the people into electro would be THRILLED that major lazer is coming  so if it bothers you so much  then find another festival to go to.,0
Roskilde Festival. Do you know anything about Flux Pavillion will Feat. Major Lazer at Roskilde? or is it also up to Major lazer to decide?,0
I´m looking forward to it...:-),0
basically just spaffed myself,0
Dennis Meyer  you didn't see our reply? We don't know any details atm. We don't know who he will bring.,0
Kasper Knaldgas Henriksen  right  Mark Ernestus is a true  pop  act. As are Carcass and Dilated Peoples.,0
We've booked Major Lazer - it's up to him who he will bring :-),0
 him  which one of them  Diplo  Jillionaire or Walshy Fire? Since you know  Major Lazer is a trio.,0
oh  I like when you get feisty  Roskilde Festival :*,0
Nero Atlas Storm  Good point. We thought of main man Diplo in this case.,0
Btw  this booking won me and my girlfriend over  fuck Hovefestivalen  we're going to Denmark this summer! :),0
Can you guys please add Cream to your line-up? Please? That would be excellent <3,0
Ooh  exciting! You'll know more tomorrow...,0
I recall wishing for Major Lazer and Buraka Som Sistema - could you tell us what genre it is?,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU0wxC_qjc  Why not???,0
It's not possible to buy entrance only for the camping area. Hope to see you anyway  read about tickets here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/ticket/,0
Michael Reincke Vahl  that's not a problem  just remember to bring your receipt and legitimation. We hope to see you  read more here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/ticket/,0

Do you think women’s football can help fight social injustice? We think so. That's why we support the non-profit organisation DISCOVER FOOTBALL.  Buy the Making a Change Ticket for Roskilde Festival 2017 and support with a donation of 200 DKK.,12
Sure  but we need more artists,0
You'll get more. A lot more. Stay tuned!,0
Roskilde Festival  how long should we  stay tuned ?  -),0
Yesterday the Roskilde Festival HQ was buzzing with foodies! We hosted a meet-up between the master chefs from the food stalls at Roskilde Festival and a whole bunch of organic food producers. We also invited some food consultants to help out the vendors reach our 2017 ambition: to become 90% organic at Roskilde Festival 2017!,16
The quality of the food at Roskilde Festival has really gone down since they dictatored that every foodstall should at least be 75% organic.  Seriously folks  conventionel food isnt poison......,0
Yes  but any band news soon?,0
New acts  come on it is not a food festival  but music and orange feeling is what its all about??????. Cant wait...,0
I dont support the organic wave.. Cant we get a normal hotdog that tastes like a hotdog instead of that nasty bread with orange mustard and some wannabe meat replacement!,0
A lot more music is coming up!,0
Hmm... Something being organic doesn't mean that it's not real meat... We'll have some kick-ass hotdogs for you - and the sausages will be great tasting organic meat. Don't worry.,0
Hey but its gonna cost you 100 euros Now!,0
Can't say that I agree. I've been to Roskilde for the past 18 years  and I've only seen the quality go up.,0
You can now exchange your wristband at any entrance. The ticket for East 2 only applied to guests arriving yesterday.,0
Hope you had an amazing first day! Here's how you saw it on social media.  Keep using #RF15 and your photo or tweet might be in one of these stories in the coming days,5
Hannah McDonald Alysha Murphy This time 2 years ago ... 2 years!,0
Do not sell or buy tickets for over the purchase price of 2000DKK.,0
Is there anyone selling their Roskilde full festival ticket?,0
Hey Esther  you can try out our waitinglist for tickets http://www.billetnet.dk/feature/rfventelister/?l=en-us&language=en-us,0
Hey Nanna  at this time it is not realistic to get a ticket from the waiting list but it is still possible to be a volunteer at #RF15 check out https://twitter.com/RFvolunteer,0
The toilets in M are between M39 and M40 by the road.,0

Big medium or small?,0
JAH as in Jahovia  black star as in black star line. This have to be a reggae act!,0
Let's just get this one out of the way - it's NOT Rage Against the Machine,0
Its Bowie ofcourse. The Starman :),0
Calling it.  It's SOJA.,0
Easy Star All Stars?,0
You can't do this to us! Rage!,0
please rage against the machine,0
Sierra Leone Refugee All Stars?,0
Ove nyström: 90% of all roskilde-comments are about RATM. It's some sort of disease or syndrome..,0
Wow... Both RATM AND Daft Punk! Amazing!,0
IF....and it is a big IF  Rage is coming  in which they don't  you'll have need to put more tickets out for sale....,0
Everything that is not RATM = dissapointment,0
So happy it's not Rage Against The Machine they haven't made any new music in years and live off that one wonderful album they made the last decade. Please never book them until they have something new for us to enjoy  ),0
RATM is on hiatus  so that's a definite no,0
The Offspring,0

Major Lazer ft Flux Pavilion???!? :D,0
The Offspring!,0
Converse All Star ft chuck Taylor,0
Well done  Tommi Avelin. You guessed our teaser. The correct answer is MAJOR LAZER.  Here’s the logic behind the whole thing: The story about the Major Lazer figure is that he was a Jamaican soldier who lost his arm in battle. He was rescued by the US military who installed this lazer weapon where his arm used to be - and now he fights evil as a true superhero.  The symbol for the military is an encircled star - and in many cases the circle is some kind of front sight. This symbol is a reference to Major Lazer as a soldier. Behind the star you can see the word ‘jah’. Jah is a Rastafari reference to God. Major Lazer’s music is full of dancehall and reggaeton elements  so here’s your Jamaican link. More specifically  Major Lazer has put out a single called “Jah No Partial”.,0
A short  dramatic trailer from today's opening. Tomorrow: Music on the Pavilion Junior stage and LOTS of event at the big festival area. Have a good night.,5
Street City - Søndag d. 1 juli 2012,0
have a nice festival!,0
Has it really been 24 years since last....get this funky guy on stage. There's room in his tour calendar,0
Helloo Roskilde! Can you please give us all a reunion with SOHN this summer  last time on gloria stage was hypnotic  and he just released his new album with this on it:   ,0
Thomas  thanks for your message. First of all  it should be said that over 50 000 people have waited in the queues and we've seen a great and calm atmosphere. Everybody even remained behind the fences until 18:00 when we opened the campsite.  Having said that  it's true that some people DID cheat their way into the area  and you can rest assured that if we do find anybody at the campsite WITHOUT a valid wristband  they will face a fee of DKK 3 500 as we have warned everybody about. There were signs attached to the fences so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody.,0
Yes  a ticket is required for Roskilde  and you can't get a ticket just for warm-up.,0
There are toilets at M  between M39 and M40 by the road.,0
First time ever it was very hard for me and my friends to find camp on this year Roskilde Festival. It was about 4 to 5 hours to find a camp.I have never expressen like this before at Roskilde. Please make it more easy for everybody to camp next year,0
GaT  Get a place is a better choice imho,0
Hey Roskilde  is there somewhere I can check for items that have been handed in. Lost my wallet :S,0
There's a Lost and Found office on the camping site. I think it's near the Apollo stage. Somehow it has fallen off the map in the printed programme  but look in the RED section – practical information under L for lost property – there's information about its whereabouts.,0
Hey Luke  Anders is correct  the Lost and Found is by the Apollo stage.,0
Thanks  I will go by later,0
HUMANS OF ROSKILDE - For one week each year  diverse groups of people from all over the world come together to build and live in a city we call Roskilde Festival. Here is a story from one of our inhabitants!   I came from Ghana where I study environmental science  but right now I am studying at a folk high school in Helsingør. That's what brought me to Roskilde. It's my first festival and I'm volunteering with Camp Aid. I'm with a group of other international students. We may not have tents right now  but we do have pizza.  Nannet  19 (but will be 20 soon!),6
No tents but pizza hmm I guess I will need both,0
I hope she'll have a great firstie ????,0
Last time there was 92,0
Pizza but no tent - she's a natural!,0
I´ve been crying and searching my apartment all day long  but now I have to accept the fact that I must have accidently thrown away my Roskilde-tickets... :( I´m totally devastated  it would be my 10th year at the festival this year... And I just can´t afford to buy new ones... Well I somehow will HAVE to find a way to buy a new one for my friend at least  or she´ll kill me. I just wonder if there is any possible way I could get new tickets with the help of my ticket-receipt?? I mean  there is a code on the tickets  right?! So I couldn´t use a ticket twice anyway (in case my tickets should turn up)  cause you scan them at the entrences. I´m grasping for straws here... PLEASE please please  I´d really really appreciate your help! As soon as possible... please! ,0
The camping areas have now opened. Welcome everyone - and have a GREAT Roskilde Festival!  Photo: Andreas Houmann,6
Here it is! Tuborg and Roskilde Festival welcome you to the extraordinary pub “Bodega Den Gyldne Dame”. It's always on the move. When it stops  it functions as a regular pub  but after a short while it moves to a new festival location...and probably pops up near you somewhere.,7
Still considering but haven't bought your ticket yet? This is your last chance before Roskilde 2012 is sold out.,2
Bare køb get a place??,0
http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2017/the-weeknd-will-play-roskilde-festival-2017,0
We want to be part of the show. How do we apply for it? thank you!,0
Hello. Unfortunately  we do not accept applications for the festival programming.,0
I hear a rumour that Pearl Jam will play Roskilde 2014  is there any truth in this rumour  hopefully so:-),0
It's not. http://www.rockwerchter.be/en/news/detail/pearl-jam-headline-on-saturday-5-july,0
But they are currently not booked on the 4th or 6th July  so perhaps it is possible?,0
If you read the link you'll see that PJ only plays two festival shows in 2014. Werchter and Open'er,0
Thanks Morten  then I will watch them in UK instead  shme though  it would have been great.,0
It sure would. Since they are actually playing festivals during Roskilde this year  it seems very obvious that we will never see Pearl Jam at Roskilde again. Sad  of course  but also very understandable that PJ can have lots of reasons not to play there again.,0
Paul Burgess  Pearl Jam will not play at Roskilde Festival 2014. We really hope that they'll be ready to play here again some day. We'd love to have them back. But we respect their decision if they don't want to be back at Roskilde.,0
Thanks Roskilde Festival  I hope they also want to come back one day. Until then  will just have to see them elsewhere  but still looking forward to Roskilde 2014 anyway:-),0
Roskilde Festival will we get more new acts before christmas ?,0
Ok  i hope we will do :) I really hoping for AC/DC :),0
No. It just means that you have to wait until the ones with entrance booking have entered.,0
Please bring your receipt to the ticket office at the entrance.,0
Finally some new sounds from Arcade Fire. You can probably guess who it's about on a day like today.  Catch Arcade Fire at Roskilde Festival 2017. It will be grand!   www.roskilde-festival.dk/tickets,8
When is the next announcement for new acts coming? Roskilde Festival,0
Roskilde Festival when do you release the programme? I'm dying to know what date Arcade Fire will be playing!,0
It won't be long...,0
When spring has sprung we'll be ready with playing dates and set times.,0
Great! Giddy with excitement already!  ??????,0
Roskilde Festival Still dreaming to read just two simple words...  Steel  Panther  <3 <3,0

They're gonna play on the 1st! http://arcadefire.com/site/live/,0
Thank you  Vickie Hafsjold Lund Andersen,0

Roskilde Festival! Jamiroquai just announced a tour. It looks like they can easily fit our lovely festival into the calender. Make it so!  (See this as an order rather than a request).,0
Since Gogol Bordello is already playing Tinderbox  I wouldn't count on them. A thousand times yes to Jamiroquai though!,0
AND NOW WE'RE AT IT CAN I FOR THE THOUSAND TIME PLEASE ASK FOR EMINEM HOW HARD CAN IT BE THANK YOU IN ADVANCE Roskilde Festival,0
I already bought a ticket  but I may have to buy one more in joy :P,0
You're always welcome to ask...,0
Roskilde Festival After asking for 9 straight years the caps-lock finally managed to break my normally calm surface.. The wish is just so strong.  I'll see you anyway though  just as in the previous years and the years to come.,0
It is pretty hard to book a guy how plays so few and close to non shows in Europa,0
But the ones he does play are golden  Martin ??,0
So any news on you attempting on solving the pre-entrace mayhem?,0
No news on this matter yet.,0
Hey Roskilde  how about going for some of the headliners from Rock Am Park/Ring? The likes of Linking Park  Avenged Sevenfold and Fall Out Boy would surely fill the stages! Cheers!,0
Just sayin',0
NorthSide Festival snagged them  so they won't be going to Roskilde.,0
The proper Orange feeling,0
Can anyone help need a wheelchair to help young sone get round the festival? Is there anywhere to hire one from have wheels to get there.... as driven from UK :-),0

Thank you :-),0
That place where you can charge your phone. Where is it this year?,0

We can't say yet when we're ready with more. But rest assured that we're working on it.,0
How about no,0
Our great volunteer team of pro-active recyclers  RFReact  will be working hard all week  keeping the festival grounds as nice and trash-free as possible. Help them out - they can't do it without you. Leave it like you found it.,3

Great photo! Unfortunately i can't come to Roskilde this year:(,0

Wish I was there. Maybe next year,0
My friend from Bulgaria will join us this year ^^ ...never been here before :P Roskilde = a good place to start!,0

#campsolastyear are ready!! See you @ Roskilde!!,0
Can't wait,0
see you next week,0
Missa like :o),0
Alcohol doesn't solve any problems. But then again  neither does milk. Ses på Roskilde!,0
Is this the band Una Corda?,0
Looking forward to see KÚRA <3,0
See you tomorrow! :D,0
i can feel it !!! i'm so ready :D,0
Actually  I'm looking forward to Gloria rather than the Orange! Gurrumul promises to be something very special there.,0
See you 2013 with a better lineup. I still like you  Danish diva of festivals.  -),0
So i will not like   your lineup is too boring this year and you've manage to make the few bands I would like to see playing at the same moments   that's pretty illogical ...,0
A true dream :),0
First beer down:) The roald-trip is offically starting now!!! Skåååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååååål!!,0

Only  Like  because of your last name!! Lewandowski,0
Any other Australians here?? ??????,0
Jaaaaaaar :D,0
Why should I go to your festival?,0
For starters  why settle for less?  If you haven't been here before  you may not know what we have in store for you.  Music-wise we have one of the most diverse line-ups in the world  serving both rock  metal  hip hop  electronica  world music and pop. We present both the big stars and lots of new exciting acts that can grow into something big the following year.  And then there's the atmosphere. That's what we refer to as the orange feeling. Ask ANYONE who's been here. They'll tell you it's unique and you won't find anything like it anywhere in the world.  We have people coming from all over the world - some choose to fly all the way from Australia to revisit Roskilde because they've been hooked. That's what it does to you!  Enough talk. Watch this and you catch a glimpse of what the whole she-bang is all about.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8KDAVvTTkk,0
Thanks for the answer! I'll be planning to pay you guys a visit!,0
well  yeah... Join :D it's gonna be awesome!! (Again) :D,0
Chris Meylan  sounds good - see you!,0
Yes  we do have Santas at Roskilde Festival.  You - audience and volunteers - are making possible this donation of DKK 900 000 (approx. EUR 121 000) to the socially disadvantaged. Hopefully it can bring some warmth to others in this cold time of year.  Roskilde Festival is 100 % non-profit.

The time has come to get the following artist:  Over their 17 year career  Linkin Park have sold 60 million albums  had numerous #1 singles  won 2 Grammys and were the first band to hit the 1 billion view mark on Youtube.   It would be a massive party!,0
Arctic Monkeys first played here when they started out. They developed and played here again. Now  on top of their game and backed by their best album yet  we welcome Arctic Monkeys back to Roskilde Festival 2014! Only Scandinavian festival gig this summer.,346
Sweeet! Some time  no see  ),0

Wow. Such hype.,0
Who the fuck are the Arctic Monkeys?,0
Are you recycling the program? Give us something we haven't seen or something we haven't seen in a long time.,0

Again?!?!,0
Thats already made me happy  along with the hip hop bands. Can you also book Snoop Dogg  he loves coming to Denmark and would say yes :-),0
 Arctic Monkeys first played here when they started out.   That's great. It really is. We all love seeing underground bands at Roskilde. Except  that's disappearing. Fewer bands  same budget. Means we can expect seeing another Rihanna or two this year  directly against the Roskilde spirit.,0
Let´s just hope they do it better than in '06 and '07  because that was shiiiiiiiiit ....,0
let's go! Jean S. P. Langi Andres Fransisco ! :D :D,0
Ohh Yeah  welcome back boys.. :D :D :D,0

Are you done packing yet!? Find your tuxedo  suit  tie or dress and remember to pack it in your Roskilde suitcase together with your rain coat.,0
Fucking Roskilde Festival buses!!! At first I had to pay 20dkk to get to check-in which is situated outside of the festival area and then second time to get from check-in to west camp! It's a shame. NON PROFIT NON PROFIT NON PROFIT,0
Yes you can  but only once the people with entrance tickets have got into the site which can take a couple of hours.,0
I might be wrong but I think it says so on the ticket,0
Hi Steen  you can just use your smartphone to show the barcode at the wristband exchange.,0
what about entrance booking? Can you also show that on your smartphone?,0

Hey! I was just about to buy my ticket for this year's festival  but when I wanted to buy an entrance booking as well  the site was all messed up (as you can probably see here)  and I couldn't check the terms and conditions box.  I don't know if this is a general issue  or if I am alone on this problem  but I thought I'd notify you anyways. :),0
Are the tickets going to continue going up 100 kr every year?? ,0
Well  no. They didn't this year. Last year was DKK 1910 (fee included)  and this year it's DKK 1910 (fee included).,0
is slipknot comeing back this time on Roskilde ?,0
Not likely.,0
Okay :D,0
Please book U2 to Roskilde Festival next year  :) ,0

Who needs a shower? We're having some truly bad weather over Roskilde atm  and we recommend everyone to stay at home until tomorrow when we open the gates.,7
Wow  we done the Roskilde festival in 1984. The problem was we had no idea how expensive Scandinavia was at the time so we had to go busking in Copenhagen,0
Joakim Andersson  we like your positive mindset.,0
What does  until we open the gates  mean? Stay at home until saturday evening  or stay at home until saturday morning when the entrance-booking-waiting-areas open?,0
I asusme it means until saturday morning  nobody wants to stay home until tomorrow evening.,0
Rasmus Lund-Hansen  it just means: come tomorrow  please.,0

I wanna get tickets for someone's bday in a couple weeks...can u give any idea on when solanges dates will be released?,0
Usually it is around April. We have to wait until the full line-up is ready to say exactly when and where each artist will perform.,0
Thank you for update ????,0
Hi friends and family! Does anyone know if the handicamp has electricity outlets and when and on what day it opens? Saturday? We have a guy with sleep apnoe with us this year and he needs a breathing thing at night...Thanks for the help  and see you soon!,0
Hi Daniel  There are two  handicamps  at the festival  which you can read about here:http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?accommodation=accommodation-information&disability-service=general-information camping concert-access parking  I think both of them open when the regular camping areas open as well  that is  Saturday. It DOESN'T sound from the information I linked above that it's possible to supply ordinary 220v outlets to your individual tents which a sleep apnea mask like the one you describe maybe requires  but you are able to recharge equipment in the handicamps. To be certain  you probably have to write the festival an email at either HandicapService@roskilde-festival.dk or info@roskilde-festival.dk to check.,0
thx!!! this helps a bit...we sent emails to both adresses weeks ago  still no reply...,0
Hi Daniel. We will get back to you as soon as possible.,0
Could be awesome to have Rolling Stones back to Roskilde  :),0
I hope so!!!,0

Dear Roskilde festival..  can we cut a deal? If any band ( I mean ANY band) cancel this festival at the last minute. Will you then call on Entombed to save the day? ,0
Or you could just ask them to pick a campingspot for you. Entrance ticket is only needed for the first hour or two,0
Please book Noisia for a Dj-set!,0

Hey guys. If I bought an entrance booking from someone else  what do I do in terms of printing/having my name on it/etc etc? Can I just use it from my phone if I've got my actual ticket printed?,0
We’re cutting 24 hours from the opening in 2014 – because we believe that eight days of Roskilde are better than nine!  A few years back – 2010 to be specific – we moved the opening day from Sunday to Saturday. We did this to have a more calm arrival situation – however  some of the more than 30 000 early birds were a bit too eager to get into the campsite and start building their camp. Back then you could get your Roskilde wristband in Tivoli from Friday – and many people went directly from Tivoli to Roskilde. By opening the campsite in the evening and presenting entrance booking have helped a bit on the atmosphere.  A consequence of the prolonged warm-up was that many – us included – felt that the festival seemed a bit ’out of focus’ and unclear. We’ve stated earlier that a great deal of participants felt tired when we reached Thursday. We still believe this. But there’s more to it. This is just as much about focusing the many events and activities that we spend so many hours on preparing and creating  so that they don’t spread over as many days – that way they will appear sharper and will be noticed and used by more people.  So this year we’re trying to sharpen things in a lot of places. We concentrate our art projects on fewer geographical areas  we create a brand-new music stage at CITYcentre East  we gear up our Dream City and Street City and much more. And we cut off 24 hours of the opening.  We want to appear sharp and relevant for everyone who want to dive into a week full of unpredictable Roskilde living. And it’s important for us to develop and sharpen the festival and not just repeat the same year after year. And with four days of camping craziness before we begin with four days of music at the festival site  we hope to find the right balance again.  And just to make it clear: we’re NOT cutting one day off to save money. We still build a city from nothing on a field  and we still need to rent the same amount of equipment and gear regardless if we opened Saturday or Sunday. Or Friday  even. We wouldn’t save much. And on that note  we don’t spend less money on music in 2014 compared to 2013 either.,0
i went to roskilde by myself last year. wearing a bunny suit. i came with a case of tuborg and a sleeping bag. everyone was nice and sorted me out. it was the highlight of my year. just wanted to say thank you  and that i'm going to try to come back again (and again). ,0
That's great to hear  Billy. You were struck by that special orange feeling. We hope to see you again!,0
How come you take one day away from us  and then add 100 DKR too the ticket price. I think it would make more sense add one day  and the add 100 DKR to the ticket price.  Please comment this Roskilde Festival,0
The ticket price is the same as last year. And you can find the reason for removing one day further down this page :),0
As Peter said  the price remains the same as in 2013.  We’re cutting 24 hours from the opening in 2014 – because we believe that eight days of Roskilde are better than nine!  A few years back – 2010 to be specific – we moved the opening day from Sunday to Saturday. We did this to have a more calm arrival situation – however  some of the more than 30 000 early birds were a bit too eager to get into the campsite and start building their camp. Back then you could get your Roskilde wristband in Tivoli from Friday – and many people went directly from Tivoli to Roskilde. By opening the campsite in the evening and presenting entrance booking have helped a bit on the atmosphere.  A consequence of the prolonged warm-up was that many – us included – felt that the festival seemed a bit ’out of focus’ and unclear. We’ve stated earlier that a great deal of participants felt tired when we reached Thursday. We still believe this. But there’s more to it. This is just as much about focusing the many events and activities that we spend so many hours on preparing and creating  so that they don’t spread over as many days – that way they will appear sharper and will be noticed and used by more people.  So this year we’re trying to sharpen things in a lot of places. We concentrate our art projects on fewer geographical areas  we create a brand-new music stage at CITYcentre East  we gear up our Dream City and Street City and much more. And we cut off 24 hours of the opening.  We want to appear sharp and relevant for everyone who want to dive into a week full of unpredictable Roskilde living. And it’s important for us to develop and sharpen the festival and not just repeat the same year after year. And with four days of camping craziness before we begin with four days of music at the festival site  we hope to find the right balance again.  And just to make it clear: we’re NOT cutting one day off to save money. We still build a city from nothing on a field  and we still need to rent the same amount of equipment and gear regardless if we opened Saturday or Sunday. Or Friday  even. We wouldn’t save much. And on that note  we don’t spend less money on music in 2014 compared to 2013 either.,0

Boris Sebastian Nordmann  you're right. Try here instead: https://soundcloud.com/in-my-room/sets/trentem-ller-lost/,0

We’re proud to add mighty Pusha T to our 2014 line-up. Hip hop with pop hooks to make you long for summer at Roskilde Festival.  Earlier today we also announced Dilated Peoples.  We’ll be back Friday with two more announcements.  ---------- This week you can look forward to both rock  hip hop  metal  pop and electronica - as some kind of concentrate of that unpredictable diversity that is Roskilde. And then you’ll get the big guns later in the season. ----------,56
What a fucking swag fag...-,0
Would've been better if it was Clipse and not Pusha T : ],0
Jeppe Deppedue  this guy was around with Clipse long before that silly term was invented.,0
like that would deprive anyone of their musical talent  don't hate cus he's wearing shit worth your house,0
Real hip hop fuck your opinion,0
Sure..- Clipse is bad ass..- But what he wears is part of the swag-train  He doesn't do hip hop for the hip hop but for the stuff he's wearing..- That's my problem.,0
Matti Bugge  we had them in 2007.,0
I know. But that doesn't change the fact that I would rather want to experience them again instead of just Pusha T. And you have booked the same bands several times in the past (: awesome booking of Dilated Peoples though!,0
Uh  you couldn't be anymore wrong  Pusha is always wearing some high fashion shit like balmain  givenchy and balenciaga. Not Obey  Supreme or whatever.  And how does he do hiphop for the stuff he's wearing when his main subject matter is about pushing weight?,0
THATS THE DUMBEST THING I EVER HEARD.. someone teach this man to use google before he makes a fool out of himself again ..,0
Carl Oxwall  the love of hip hop has no age. Glad you dig it!,0
poke the bear,0
The Prodigy will play in Iceland next june.  Please book them also to Roskilde  :),0
Will we get the first big headliner someday before christmas :) ?,0
My wish for bands on the festival is David Bowie and Rolling Stones. I would prefer  that their concerts are so close  that we will get a chance to hear the 2 greates still living Icons play  Dancing in the streets  together on stage. Just a wish!  I would also like to see Adam Cohen - he's great  I've seen him on Tønder festival a couple of times. And if you could get Leonard Cohen there as well  so they could be on stage together  that would just be great. These 2 suggestions would make Roskilde festival for me. And What do you know.- How long do we have these Icons around. - So please - make a difference - get them there  and let us all experience these  great artists.,0
It's such a pleasure to welcome hip hop heroes Dilated Peoples to Roskilde 2014.  They played at Roskilde in 1999  and we've also had the pleasure of Evidence solo in 2012. Now  they'll be back!  Check back at 13 when we'll reveal today's second hip hop act.  ---------- This week you can look forward to both rock  hip hop  metal  pop and electronica - as some kind of concentrate of that unpredictable diversity that is Roskilde. And then you’ll get the big guns later in the season. ----------,88
How is this not a big gun? D:,0
Sadly he hasn't got likes enough. We're looking at 620k if I remember correctly.,0
I think it's Pusha T. His numbers are soaring atm. though – it was 620k at the beginning of the week. Now it's almost 645k.,0
Frederik Trojaborg Julian  these are solid acts  no doubt - and most of them deserve to be big.,0
where can you follow these votings?,0
Cillian: It's basic Facebook  likes   so it hasn't got anything to do with Roskilde other than they put out clues as to how many  likes  each of the upcoming announcements has here. Pusha T's page has 645.000 likes.,0
Peter Oliver Andreasen  so soon? Anyways  we're glad you dig it!,0
do you think Asap Ferg has a chance today?,0
Could be him too – haven't been paying intention to his like-stats at the beginning of the week. Rooting for Pusha though!,0
Jess Pries-Hansen  sounds good - see you this summer!,0
wouldnt say these are solid acts  but this particular one is indeed,0
Otto K Lund  really? With 160 acts you pay about DKK 12 for each one. And all other services are included. That's a fair price.,0
Jakob Aboali Andersen  we always listen to our audience. We can't always fulfill each and every band wish - but we try whenever possible.,0
(Y),0
Nikolai Eikevik  it's top-notch music  don't get us wrong. They will just not be placed at the very top of the poster.,0
Nice! :D,0
hej one question  if a friend of mine want's to buy a ticket today or tomorrow could it be possible to not have it sent by post and instead collect it when she gets there on the 4th?,0
If your ticket doesn't make it  hang on to your receipt and print it out. You'll be in Billetlugen's database  and the personell on-site will figure out whether or not you have bought a ticket from that. Et voila!,0
Hey Mari  that's true. Are you coming to Roskilde too? Så må vi da lige mødes!,0
Got a full festival ticket for sale  entrance booking east 2.  PM if interested :),0
We'll do something  sure. Just gotta create an official profile first.,0

my friend cannot go to roskilde-festival. can i buy his ticket then  blud?,0
Metallica will tour next 3 to 4 years and he talk here about Roskilde maybe play there next time after the shows in Denmark in februar next year :) ,0
U2 to do festivals ? if that is true then i hope we will get them to Roskilde next year :) ,0
Guns n roses will be in Sweden on june 29. Lets hope they will play Roskilde also  :),0
I have 1 Roskilde ticket to sell. All week  no entrance booking.,0
Just a question: Will there be more House  rave  dubstep music this year? There will be more people to see  say Avicii than some hardcore metal band. I know the festival is about diversity and i love that aspect of the festival but have you considered more uplifting and rave oriented artists this year? Could be nice for a change :),0
More than one fourth of the programme was electronically based last year. Isn't that enough?,0
Sophus Victor Hoffmann  can't be specific at this point - but we can say that we're aware of the fact that our audience want ENERGY both from guitars and from MCPs - and we're always considering how to make the right mix of listening experiences and party experiences.,0
And there will be a lot more ppl to a Metallica show then some weird dubstep show..,0
And im just making an example with rave etc. Compared to hardcore metal  to show the increasing popularity. Because it is more popular than hardcore metal atm. I took your pop argument as an insult to the house/rave/EDM genre because i thought you meant they make house etc. And i fucking hate seebach and all that shit  so that was a bit of a misunderstanding there.  The argument with house genre drawing more people Is legit enough. cause it shows what the festivalpeople wants to hear.  And m8 i didnt call you names? If i did im sorry. But we are never going to agree  so im out. Take care man,0
We welcome extreme metal legends Carcass to Roskilde Festival 2014. Earlier we also announced Nails.   What's the most extreme thing you've seen at Roskilde?  We'll be back tomorrow with much different genre.  ---------- This week you can look forward to both rock  hip hop  metal  pop and electronica - as some kind of concentrate of that unpredictable diversity that is Roskilde. And then you’ll get the big guns later in the season. ----------,23
:D :D :D,0
The toilets,0
Cool but I will se them on friday so its not exactly something I will run out and buy a Roskilde ticket to see.,0

Nails!!!! :D Can't wait. That'll be a hell of a concert. Perfect for pavillion.,0
northside gets pixies we get carcass...... think i do a dobbel this year!  -),0
The most extreme for me must be The Chemical Brothers in 2008.  I was quite sick (w. flu symptoms) that night  but I forgot I was sick as soon as they started playing. I walked away from that concert cross eyed  dizzy and coughing  but it was worth it!,0
Waiting for Lamb of God,0
Nails may be the most extreme band at Roskilde 2014. They will will definitely rip you right out of your comfort zone.  Check back at 13 when we'll reveal today's second band.  ---------- This week you can look forward to both rock  hip hop  metal  pop and electronica - as some kind of concentrate of that unpredictable diversity that is Roskilde. And then you’ll get the big guns later in the season. ----------,19

It's time for some great indie rock. Our second announcement today is Deerhunter.

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth  mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again  fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm  maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead  kid. I can be anywhere  anytime  and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways  and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat  but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent  you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you  maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t  you didn’t  and now you’re paying the price  you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead  kiddo. ,0

Hey!  That's the guy that left the disaster in the port-o-let that broke the shit truck!  Let's get him boys!!!,0
Where the fuck are my flamingos?!,0
The Roskilde people have spoken. You want music announcements!  So  we’re filling next week up with Roskilde acts.  And we’ll make sure to be all over the genre map. Look forward to both rock  hip hop  metal  pop and electronica - as some kind of concentrate of that unpredictable diversity that is Roskilde.  And then you’ll get the big guns later in the season.,87
about time,0
Tool og Rage Against The Machine  tak!,0
Michaela we gotta gooooo,0
about damn time!,0
I hope  that despite closing down Cosmopol  you´ll still have the best World Music lineup in the world (of major festivals that is)...,0
Carpark North opening Orange Stage!!! And some other acts like Halestorm  Alter Bridge  Skillet  Fall Out Boy wouldn't hurt either :),0
hmm how could we keep up the crowd's attention? - make an announcement-announcement,0
Kissaway Trail   A Place To Bury Strangers  Psyched Up Janis,0
Carl Justus Fuchs  you got it! Did you see our previous post - we asked everyone if they wanted to wait for a headliner or get some music announcements. Call it service information.,0
Jeppe Helge Hansen  remember  focus is not on headliners this time around.,0
Big guns??? Guns and roses?,0
Troels Katholm  well... no.,0
Jonathan!! :D,0
So it has begun. Tobias  Louise  Lisa  Viktor.,0
Hardrock -Metal - Trash Metal all good,0
How about some real metal ?! Not fucking Rihanna?!,0
no punk rock bands once again? Isn't it about time Roskilde stops ignoring the existence of the genre? (No  Savages  iceage etc do not qualify as punk bands for anyone who's listened to the style since the 80s :D),0
I'm satisfied with any announcement! As long as they contain words like Radio  Rage  McCartney  Neil or Young  ) I probably have 200 more words to throw at you. Do you have an open spot in your booking department?,0
PLEASE have Alt-J and civil wars  and... of monsters and men (again) !!! :) :),0
David Bowie or/and Paul McCartney. God  all my dreams would come true!,0
no we want HAWKWIND,0
THE BLUE ANGEL LOUNGE  !    But not at 02:oo ! ! !,0
Rise Against later! <3,0
Roskilde people  help us decide...  We’re working hard on closing the deals with the first headlining acts for Roskilde 2014. However  it can still take some time. So  what do you say:  1) That’s ok  I am going to spend the next month listening to Christmas songs anyway!  2) Take my mind off Wham  please! Give me something to remind me that summer is coming back…,11
GIVE US NAMES NOW!!!!! EVEN SMALL ONES!!!!!!!,0
Please please PLEEEEASE give me something to drown out  Last Christmas !,0
Number 2  unless you want everybody to buy tickets for Northside Festival before Xmas.,0
Get on with it! Give us a teaser! 2!!!,0
Wham! Is reuniting at Roskilde?!? I just wet my pants...a lot!!!,0
For the love of god  number 2.,0
2 - and announce Wham!  ),0
1  Take your time. Everything starts small and takes time.,0
Number 2 of course. Northside is taking all the attention and I hate Christmas songs :),0
2 - then we will know what to expect at #NS15 :) come on #RF14,0
Both!,0
1 !! No stress!,0
Just confirm David Bowie (Official)  and I'll be happy =),0
Get this fkn show on the rd !!!!!,0
2  most def  cant wait!!!,0
number 2  ) #RF14 just 1 name  ),0
2  or even better... What Rasmus Kiølseth Madsen said! :-),0
I prefer a great act rather than to know about it soon..,0
confirm the black keys and I will happily join Roskilde next year for a great experience! :),0
2! A headliner before christmas is a must. Also a couple of midliners would be nice!,0
2. Do it!,0
1. I love x-mas songs nearly as much as being lobotomized with a rusty chainsaw.,0
As long as the music you pick is good  I don't really care :) I'm exited to come again in 2014.  Just bring us the music in time :D,0
Just give us OutKast and I can live with 1 for another 4-5 months! Otherwise: 2,0
2! - you lazy Danes...  -),0
2) plus announce The Pretty Reckless are playing.,0
TWOOOOOOOOOO!! Get to it!! Patience may be a vrtue  but  not in this case.,0
2....... And announce  The Black Keys....:-),0
Are you booking Wham?,0
Kommer Wham?! :o,0
Kommer Wham?! :o,0
Rage Against The Wham Machine!,0
i'll be there anyway!,0
CAN'T WAIT - WHAM AT RF14 :D hahah,0
who is this Wham?,0
Tenacious D,0
2) just tell us already!,0
EMINEM and John Mayer,0
Let me think... Oh no already know it: second!!!,0
I would definitely wait. Anything you announce will be compared  measured and weighed against Northside 14 in the public opinion. So if you announce smaller acts first everybody will start saying that NS14 have programme that is way stronger then RF14.,0
2) Take my mind off Wham  please! Give me something to remind me that summer is coming back…,0
And lets face it - NS14 do have a very strong line up already.,0
Radiohead! pretty please? ..i've been a good boy this year...,0
The offspring!,0
2: I listen to all of the artists anyway  so I might as well get started :),0
2) giv us something!! think of it as an early chrismas present :),0
2!!! To!!,0
Take my mind off Wham  please,0
Announce Kanye West  then i'll be alright listening to Wham! for a whole month. YEEZUS! <3 <3 <3,0
2! I crave a headliner!!!,0
2 and please book the foo fighters!!!,0
Option 2 all the way!,0
Rise Against! Roskilde Festival  you and Rise Against are perfect for each other!,0
2  and if you guys could book Macklemore that would be great.,0
Put  caravan palace  in any of your tent stages and I will be there!,0
Can we say both?:-),0
3) I'm gonna go into hibernation  so I don't have to deal with Wham at all! Meanwhile you fix an awesome headlining and wake me up when dat summer comes!,0
2 for the love of god,0
Everybody buying roskilde ticket for the line-up are n00bz,0
2) C'mon  shout it out!,0
#1 except the Christmas songs  I hope it's worth the wait ??cheers and rock on ?? see ya all next summer,0
1) That's ok - but really excited to find out who it is :-),0
2) Take - my - mind - off - Wham - please! And fuck headliners. Most of my Best concerts at Roskilde is on the smaller staged anyway. :),0
Wham at Roskilde  that would be cool :).,0
1 but please before christmas. Everybody will compare RF to Northside  which already has five current or previous RF headliners  so starting by announcing unknown bands will lead to tons of complaints.,0
number 2 and also my number 3 3) it's OK im gonna listend to Peace cover of Wham! next month anyway. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vX7tC_BWoA&feature=youtu.be,0
1)!!!!!!!! :D :D,0
Both. U should decide what to do though. But i think itll be worth waiting another month for.,0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. did i say 2? 2.,0
Bring back the summer.!,0
Yes please let's hear all about summer .... the suspense!,0

1. Im a Nice person and will het the coolest xmas gifts! Santa told me so..,0
Take your sweet time...,0
It's wham  right?,0
1 ofcourse!!!! Gonna listen to Wham everyday ??,0
2) give us a name!,0
I can see 2 is mainstream so i say 1,0
I'd say: Take all the time you need - but give the people a nice christmas present :) fx. rage against the machine PLEASE <3,0
1 so we can get rid of the people who starts comparing Roskilde with northside. Both choices are fine by me  but i can't stand critique already.,0
Get us RATM  Daft Punk  Outkast and Eminem and I wont care if they are announced as late as the day before the festival!,0
E M I N E M !!,0

I dont like Christmas  and LOVE Roskilde festival! But it takes the time it takes! Looking forward to summer!,0
Book a WHAM! reunion?,0
Don't just take my mind off Wham  Take it Way... For good!,0

Question:  I bought a 'get a tent' tent and I'll be using it by myself. But my friends are bringing their own tent... so can they camp nearby? Or is the 'get a tent' area exclusive to people who have a 'get a tent' tent?  I don't wanna be by myself :p   I would have bought the tent + gear package but it disappeared today..,0
Yes  you're on your own in the get a tent area  but you can uproot the orange tent that is pitched for you there and just bring it to the regular camp site where your friends are staying. It's a little backwards and  I might add  you could as well have bought a tent package from Spejdersport. They deliver on the camp site.,0
cool it's fine if I can move it :),0
I didnt want to buy one when I arrived at Roskilde in case they sold out and I'm coming all the way from England and not arriving until the 3rd,0
I see. Then GAT is not such a bad idea  even though it is a bit of a hassle to move the tent.,0
hey Anders  do these tents come with a ground sheet btw?,0
I really hope you guys are better prepared than 2007 if it rains a little more than usually.,0
Is it ok to show the entrance ticket on the mobile?,0
does anyone have a tent i can crash?,0

Yes! and no  it doesn't have to be you're name on it.,0
As long as you switch both ticket and booking if they are seperate  the numbers/barcodes have to match,0
Please book Guns N Roses and Green Day :),0
I hoping Roskilde will be on the tour :) ,0
Would love to play in 2017!,0
http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/11/a-tribe-called-quest-to-embark-on-one-final-world-tour/ DO IT! DO IT!,0
Is that a full festival pass?,0
Any announcements soon? Christmas quiz? ,0
We're working hard on getting an act ready. It would be great to start off with something GRAND  but the negotiations can be quite lengthy. Maybe we should open with some acts from further down the poster instead - or what?  No quiz this time around.,0
I don't really know enough about marketing to comment properly  but I would definitely release something before christmas! Too bad about the quiz!,0
i Would prefere just to announce any name now  no matter how unknown the Act is. because if it happends to be a smaller Act  Roskilde Visitors got the chance to check out what the smaller bands music has to offer.  Theres a bigger chance that the Unkown bands gets More Attention when they are announce in small portions or for themselves  than getting announced with bunch of other acts.  :),0
I think having the first announcement consisting of bands in small print will be recieved with a lot of negativity  especially with Northside already having announced five current or previous headliners  so I think you should start with a headliner  but before christmas please.,0
We're working hard on getting those headliners ready. But things take time. Question is  should we release some smaller acts first - to get things going?,0
DO IT,0
I'm sure it'll be worth the wait. But yes  a little something would be gooood.,0
Get A Tent Central and Tenthouse are now sold out!  If you want the luxury of arriving to a pitched tent  you can still get your hands on Get A Tent East and Get A Camp: www.roskilde-festival.dk/tickets,24
What he said!?????,0
That was fast :D,0
I guess we cant go,0
Why,0
If there isnt anymore tents,0
Two companies are sold out but a few more. The tickets are about 275 plus tents so please tell me how many want to go... can ask Thomas to help. Sooner better. Ask the boys.,0
So it would cost every person 250 euros?,0
Is that also the airplane,0
No,0
We will see Copenhagen for the day then spend the night at beach house. Then take you all to the location.,0
Book soon not so expensive,0
So how much would the whole trip cost?,0
250 plus tent and food,0
So around 400?,0
Stemme  D,0
Put some water in east 1!! ????,0
Giv us some small names soon plz. I dont mather when then  big names  comes  the importen part is to get some names to check out/be happy about,0
Iron Maiden to play Rock Am Ring in Germany. Let s get them also to  Roskilde please :),0
ps: Iron Maiden show in 2011 at Roskilde 2011 was awesome and we want them back to Orange stage :),0
@Roskilde…Any chance you could get Faith no more again for Roskilde 2014 ?,0
Faith No More in 2009 was awesome show,0
Would be great 8-),0
Foo Fighters are finally back at Roskilde Festival!  It's been 11 years since their last visit. Back then Dave Grohl made his way through the crowd and climbed to the top of the sound tower from where he kept playing. It was truly one of those unique #RoskildeMoments!   Photo: Kristian Bertelsen,45
One of the best concerts I've attended at Roskilde  and I can't wait to see FF again in 2017 :) 2005 was a great year at Roskilde. Black Sabbath  Foo Fighters  Green Day  Audioslave and Velvet Revolver. Back then it was still a Rock festival..  ),0

Sign him up!,0
Please check these guys out  they are awesome ,0
We're working on it...  Let's say negotiations with a headliners were to take yet some time - would you rather wait for that headliner act as the first we announced or would you want us to start with smaller acts?,0
Smaller acts are always welcome  but expect the christmas sale to rise if its a headliner:-D,0
No no,0
Daft Punk :-D ??? Yes??!!,0
Soundgarden come on ??,0

Kender man en der mangler en Roskilde billet?  I would like to sell two full festival tickets. Normal price. I will be there on Saturday approx 16.00h. We can meet at e43 or west entrance. Mange tak. Ralf,0
Yep. When you get your programme  there's an ad describing what you can get. Can't remember the exact page  but it's pretty much the same goods they sell as last year.,0
Cool. Considering going without a sleeping bag  too much shit to carry otherwise!,0

Bättan Berg :O,0
What do you think of this consideration: https://www.facebook.com/orangefeeling/posts/10151670366801706,0
I saw this first now. Keep on good work. I hope we will get AC/DC and Foo Fighters to headline Roskilde next year :),0
Shouldn't you have such a food stand next year  or is that to adventurous for you? ,0
The question is  is it too adventurous for the general festival crowd? Interesting and thought-provoking idea  though!,0
I would love to try such a place  and I am sure it could sell some  it is like going on a exotic holiday right there ind the dust/mud of Roskilde Festival  and a great challenge among drunk friends  ),0

http://maidenrevelations.com/.../sonisphere-uk-iron.../ Could awesome to get these bands to Roskilde Festival in 2014 :),0
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202388177770426&set=o.136034339879&type=1&theater If this is true then i hope we will get Iron Maiden to Roskilde next year :),0
What is the policy of sound systems in the get a tent area?,0
The rule of thumb in general is to show respect for your neighbours. So ask around once you get here.,0
Do you like semi-burnt food? Then join us for this year's BBQ,0

BOOK D.A.D ,0
Stephen Andersen  the short answer to your question is that we’re cutting 24 hours from the opening in 2014 – because we believe that eight days of Roskilde are better than nine! A few years back – 2010 to be specific – we moved the opening day from Sunday to Saturday. We did this to have a more calm arrival situation – however  some of the more than 30 000 early birds were a bit too eager to get into the campsite and start building their camp. Back then you could get your Roskilde wristband in Tivoli from Friday – and many people went directly from Tivoli to Roskilde. By opening the campsite in the evening and presenting entrance booking have helped a bit on the atmosphere.  A consequence of the prolonged warm-up was that many – us included – felt that the festival seemed a bit ’out of focus’ and unclear. We’ve stated earlier that a great deal of participants felt tired when we reached Thursday. We still believe this. But there’s more to it. This is just as much about focusing the many events and activities that we spend so many hours on preparing and creating  so that they don’t spread over as many days – that way they will appear sharper and will be noticed and used by more people.  So this year we’re trying to sharpen things in a lot of places. We concentrate our art projects on fewer geographical areas  we create a brand-new music stage at CITYcentre East  we gear up our Dream City and Street City and much more. And we cut off 24 hours of the opening.  We want to appear sharp and relevant for everyone who want to dive into a week full of unpredictable Roskilde living. And it’s important for us to develop and sharpen the festival and not just repeat the same year after year. And with four days of camping craziness before we begin with four days of music at the festival site  we hope to find the right balance again.  And just to make it clear: we’re NOT cutting one day off to save money. We still build a city from nothing on a field  and we still need to rent the same amount of equipment and gear regardless if we opened Saturday or Sunday. Or Friday  even. We wouldn’t save much. And on that note  we don’t spend less money on music in 2014 compared to 2013 either.,0
Hahaha  yea  please leave a long answer:-D,0
A day in the life...  Roskilde 2013 seen from a camera put 30 metres up in the air  taking a picture every 35th second - 24 hours condensed to one and a half minute.,52

Yeah. It's pretty awesome!,0
No. Just the awning.,0
Of course  I can build my own tent. The mere fact that there are per-pitched tents in rows  shows me that the time of Rock'n Roll is over in Roskilde.,0

Yup. It's perfect for two,0
It's  not clear to me which link to choose to reserve the tenthouse... It's not in the overview when you are reverted to the ticketmaster website via the link buy tenthouse...,0

http://www.beat.com.au/festivals/2014-big-day-out-rumour-roundup So who could possibly be these massive headliners? Over at Triple M  the infamous James Young feels that AC/DC are ready to revoke their 'no festival' policy.  Let s get AC/DC to Roskilde Festival 2014 :),0

TOOL!! It has been 8 years when i come to RF14. It's about time!,0
Hoping our Elizabeth MacInnis will play your venue. Can't wait to see your choices! I hear it's an amazing event!!!,0

Cathrine From Gotfredsen Louise Stoffer east,0
Nah. Just bring some music we wanna listen to,0
What steps have been taken or will be taken to remove gravel? Are you just picking up the biggest stones from the surface  or are you digging to remove stones 10-20 cm down into the ground? If not  it won't be a very comfortable surface to sleep on... It's a huge job to do  but I hope you do it! And without removing the hills! I want my tent on one of the hills. :D,0

My first Roskilde! ??,0
No  Prophets of Rage  no System of a down  Metallica and Iron Maiden not at Roskilde next year. I hope you will book Guns N Roses and Green Day. We rock fans want something good soon.,0
System of a down and Prophets of Rage will be at COPENHELL,0
Roskilde has turned into an indie festival - you might aswel forget it :-(,0
Green Day? Are you joking?  Besides  you make it sound like  you think Roskilde should book the same bands as Copenhell  why? Why wouldn't you just go and see them at Copenhell  and enjoy the other bands at Roskilde?,0
You should get the new Hellion to play.,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  how come you have decided to cut the festival by one day  starting sunday 29th and not saturday 28th as you announced??   - Anders Petersen,0
Black Sabbath and Soudgarden are touring in Germany in June. Let s get these bands also to Roskilde :),0
Roskilde Festival is going to Hamburg tomorrow.  We present alcoholic faith mission  Parasite Single and much more at Knust Hamburg. Doors open at 18:00.  And it's free.,12
Could you do an impulsive booking on Highasakite? PLEASE?,0
https://youtu.be/Ua_UeznMqNM - Please Roskilde... make it happen ??,0
Foo fighters will tour Europe next summer. Please book them :),0
Hope u get Guns n Roses  Aerosmith or Greenday. If so I will fly over for this festival,0
URGENT SALE : 2 tickets   full pass 9 days with camping  negotiable,0
So we're losing a day next year but still have to pay the same ?,0
Actually you're paying less. Factor in inflation and the ticket would cost you about 1960-1975 DKK or so  if the real value should be the same as last year.,0
To answer your question:  yes  :) Will it affect the festival spirit:  No   Will there be alot of whining:  yes    Same as each year here on Facebook,0
Nobody is talking about spirit... I just think it sucks since my only vacation during summer is Roskilde and i want it to last as long as possible. I would imagine alot of people feel the same way.,0
This Roskilde like in good old days  always from sunday :),0
I wasn't trying to justify anything. I was merely correcting you.  But if you want me to  I'd say that the move to cut a day and a stage is a clever one  faced with the fact that a sizable chunk of the Roskilde audience has been pining for bigger and better bands for years. The fact that the music budget remains the same despite these changes will allow the festival to move in that direction.  Time will tell if it's the right one.,0
Black Sabbath to play NOVA ROCK Festival. Lets get them also to Roskilde please :) ?,0
Black Sabbath was the main reason I came for my first festival in 2005  and the reason our camp is call Camp Ozzy  so a return for my 10th festival would be perfect.,0
I hope we will get Black Sabbath :),0
http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/aerosmith-to-headline-sunday-night-at-download-plus-one-more-band-inside/ Will be awesome to get Aerosmth also to Roskilde next summer :),0
if there's only room for one oldie but godie there are a lot of bands incl. Black Sabbath I'd prefer to Aerosmith. They seem very over the hill to me.,0
Aerosmith is in U.K. in june at the Download Festival  would be cool if they returned to Roskilde 20 years after their opening at Orange Scene.,0

For those of you wanting to know exactly what is playing at the festival  but are to lazy to search all the tube links. Now is your chance. DJ Daggert will be doing a Roskilde Special on Atlas Haven Radio. There will be played one song from each artist attending this years festival. All this is going down Monday and Wednesday next week (25th and 27th) from 20.00 CET. Read more about it on DJ Daggerts profile. Don't miss out on this one!,0
Sweet  )  Now i can get a sample of it all  without having to do nothing but turn on the radio :D .. Nice Daggert ^^,0
That was exactly the point :),0
Sweet of you to put this effort in to it... Thumps up bigtime  ),0
Dear Roskilde. Your festival supports many humanitarian issues as well as advocating a 'green' environmental-friendly lifestyle. How can it be that you are at the same time promoting the alcohol industry in a scale that is without comparison in our society today? Every year thousands of people die directly because of alcohol  and even more indirectly because of drinking. 140.000 people are assumed to be addicted to alcohol  every year 120.000 children have their childhood ruined because of growing up in a family with alcohol problems.  but they can't control it. We promote moderately drinking  you might add. But you know that thousands and thousands of people on the festival drink in a scale that is highly damaging and dangerous for themselves and the people around them. Still Tuborg's logo is visible wherever you look on the festival. I look forward to enjoying my festival sober this summer  but honestly I'm afraid that I will feel alienated because of your immense alco-advertising and the heavy drinking culture it has resulted in. -Jacob ,0
It is up to yourself if and how much you want to drink. I'd even say that Tuborg's presence at Roskilde is quite behaved and moderate compared to similar festivals abroad  where Heineken or other breweries for example even get stages named after them. Tuborg has logos on each side of the two biggest stages plus the beverage sales around the festival and camp site – and that's about it.  If you feel alienated by the little advertising that is actually going on  that's probably not something Roskilde can do much about  but I don't think you should feel marginalised by the other guests at the festival. There are heaps of people at the festival who  like yourself  like to enjoy the music and other activities at the festival partially or wholly sober.  The Danish drinking culture  I might add  is not one Roskilde has orchestrated.,0
Can you guess how this is going to end up? It's something we're doing together with Tuborg  and it's of course going to be great. That's all we can say  but more clues are coming...,3

I come to Roskilde Festival every year  it is a well organised and cool festival. This year there was many critics of the line up before the festival had started  yet I think it is one of the best Roskilde 'Festivals I have been to . I have confidence that Roskilde Festival  will again book good acts  and as always it will be varied. The only thing that is needed on Roskilde  is to start having pod pads to rent  as after being in a tent for the last 35 years  I would like the option for something a little more comfortable:-) ,0
Oh  Roskilde Festival  you haven't even announced any bands yet  and I am already disappointed.  Arcade Fire announced to play at Northside Festival.  They should be playing at Orange Stage... :-(,0

I have been reading the comments regarding the bands that were announced today! And with sadnees i would like to say that i am from a country where we are learning not to be aggressive with the preferences and points of view of other people and finding that here its not accepted is dissapointing.   O thing that it would be good if people understand that the good thing of a music festival is interacition  getting to know  discover and accept that all of us dont have the same perspective and taste. Also to understand how important it is not to demerit the work of the artist that come here just beacause they are not our kind of music. Have you any idea of how much work its involved in the making of eac of those sounds? Have you ever stop to see what is behind each song? This is a multicultural music festival  which means that all sort of musical tastes are welcome  It is sort of a union of sound from all around the world.That is something inspiring if you can see it from a diferentpoint of view.  In conclusion ENJOY AND IF YOU DON`T LIKE IT KNOW IT. IF YOU DON`T WANT...then dont go....  happy Thurstday,0

Thats a shame. Well Kodaline will do instead:-),0
YO ROSKILDE. I have reasons to very much not like that Roskilde Festival is a day shorter. You say that  nothing ever happens on the first day anyway   as reasoning for removing it  you might be right on that there are no real spectacular OMG-Roskilde events on the evening after spending all your energy hauling and pitching  but having one evening dedicated to that means that you also don't have to do that during the days where  things happen .  The next day  people will spend an equal amount of time and energy pitching tents  and people will be equally exhausted. Removing one day just delays the process  and if the goal is to ensure more roskilde moments  the solution isnt to remove the times where there usually aren't any roskilde moments.  I don't know what kind of logic you're using for this decision  but I'd love to hear it explained. ,0
YO ROSKILDE. what the shit are you up to now  both the roskilde page and the event say  about 160 acts   last year you booked 195. Whaddup.  This is honestly beginning to raise some serious worries about roskilde. You shut down two stages  replaced them with one  you removed an entire day of roskilde  and you cut down the total acts by 35 bands. Considering that you actually booked Rihanna last year  this does not look like a promising direction for roskilde to go in. I'm sure that many people will agree (at least many people I know) that the last thing we need is another condensed mainstream festival.  Please don't do this.  More time  more stages  more bands  smaller bands.,0
I for one think that the decision to open Sunday is a good one for those of us who maintain steady jobs. Gives us an extra day to get into gear and pack before the festival. As it was in 2013  you'd almost have to take the Friday off too in order to get your shit together. This way we'll be much better prepared for a drunken week of debauchery and divine music.,0
2010 had two stages less than 2014 will have and even fewer bands. Still was a great festival.,0
Hey Asbjørn.  First of all  thanks for caring.  Just to sum up  we've closed two stages (Cosmopol and Odeon) and introduced two new stages (Avalon and Rising). As you may know  Rising presents upcoming artists that used to play at Pavilion Junior. So yes  it does mean one stage less. BUT bear in mind that it also means that the acts playing Avalon can be bigger. So despite cutting down a stage  we're NOT cutting down on our music budget.  And the other thing...  In 2014 we open the campsite Sunday instead of Saturday (which we used to do not that many years ago  btw). We do this because our experience is that the festival period has been a bit too long for many people (not everyone agrees on this  we're sure). We receive lots of feedback from the audience - and one tendency in the feedback is that the period has been too long from the opening of the campsite until the opening of the festival site. Many people are simply too wasted (not meaning drunk in this case) when we reach Thursday. So we cut off one day from the beginning - so now you can pitch your tent Sunday and start enjoying the Roskilde party until Thursday at 17:00 when things really get started  music-wise. And as mentioned above  you get two stages (Rising and Apollo) at the campsite in 2014. We hope this gives you greater possibilities for hunting great music experiences during the first days.,0
Roskilde Festival the thing that tires people in the end is not the camping week but the actual festival. You could make the festival last for 2 months straight and people wouldn't get tired until the last four days where everyone is bussy scheduling their day and running from one concert to another. It's a shitty decision to take away a camping day  for many reasons.  No doubt i'll be going anyways  but for the same price  don't continue taking away our favorite time of the year  man.,0
Martin Mariboe Olesen  2 months without getting tired?! Ah  we're not so sure you're right about that.  We know that everyone will not agree on this decision. Bear in mind that it wasn't that long ago that it was common practice to open Sunday. We tried to move it back one day  but we've noticed the consequences so we're moving it back (again) to Sunday.,0
Haha  no  but exaggeration promotes the message you know. :)  But it's just my experience as a festival-goer that the only thing i get tired of is having my day scheduled which is only happening in the last 4 days. chilling all day and partying all night isn't tiring  that's jsut uplifting! :),0
Roskilde Festival  first off  I think you misunderstood my concern regarding the changes to the music. I'm not worried that you'll put less resources into the music  on the contrary  that you're putting up less bands  but bigger bands. I find that a lot of the charm of Roskilde is the small stage  small crowd  small band concerts  reducing both the amount of stages and the amount of acts is pretty much the same as making fewer small concerts.  I can understand that Roskilde could be a bit too tough for a lot of people  but some of us prefer having nine days of roskilde  even consider the completely exhausted Sunday an enjoyable part of the experience. I guess you have to choose which crowd to cater to in this case  but keep in mind that there's always the option for tired guests to either take it easy and go home for a day  or arrive later at the festival. If nothing ever happens on the first day anyway  and you think that one day does a significant difference in terms of exhaustion  the people who are interested in a shorter festival might show up a day later.,0
But as always  thanks for reading and replying. It's great that you're interacting with participants like this  even though I disagree with some of your recent decisions.,0
A little fewer acts and a day shorter is gold to my ears!,0
While it might be nice for us old-timers  it is a horrible mistake by Roskilde Festival as they seem to have forgotten the entire reason for opening on Saturday in the first place was to address the queuing problems of opening Sunday.  Now  we'll return to a state where 20000+ people will queue on Saturday and storm the  fences  by early to late evening. This is not wild speculation. I think we can safely state it as a fact that it will happen. If Roskilde fails to acknowledge this  they have shown they have learned absolutely nothing from past mistakes and of general crowd control problems in general.  I'm all for cutting one day  it's just the wrong day to cut. It should have been the last Sunday where people are leaving instead. So opening would be from Saturday 18:00 to Sunday next 18:00.,0
The queuing thing depends on when exactly they open  doesn't it? Problem was  the years where they opened Sunday  that it was always Sunday  somewhere between morning to around noon as far as I remember. This time around the camping site doesn't open until 18:00 Sunday  as far as I can see. That makes it much less attractive to queue already Saturday evening. I think we'll see more or less the same situation as this year  where a handful start queuing Saturday and most people will come some time during Sunday.,0
They tried different times on Sunday. Doesn't matter much. A very large percentage will queue up from Saturday because they can  it's weekend after all  then late in the evening when everyone is smashed up  the fences will be toppled and everyone else will follow suit.  The whole reason why I originally pleaded for Roskilde to open Saturday during daylight hours was that it is unattractive for most people to start queuing on Friday. Whereas Saturday  people have nothing else to do  so why not hit the queue party?,0
Speculation: Is the 35 fewer acts because of one less music day during warm-up (about 10 names out) + one less stage (about 25 names out)?,0
Can't seem to remember  but did they ever try Sunday evening? I think the year where everything went most haywire was 2009 where the site was supposed to open early Sunday morning and the fences fell 12 hours prior to that.  I think the time of day matters – it's a psychological thing. But we'll see.,0
I hope ffs that you have taken care of the chaos at the entrances on opening day. Like  greatly limiting the number of tickets sold for each entrance. Maybe  3000 for each? and then open up for the rest of the crowd after 30 minutes or so...you sold waaay too many entrance tickets in ´13,0
We're still working on this matter. That's why we haven't mentioned much about the opening. We know things weren't great in 2013 and we definitely want to improve them.,0
I did not get a tent space last year. Had to sleep in some friends tents :(,0
Roskilde - The Experience  sorry to hear that. We'lll try our best to improve.,0

Hello Roskilde  when is it possible to enter the camping area should you not have entrance booking?,0
When all the people with entrance booking has been expedited  approximately 2hrs after the opening.,0
You sure about that? It's just that on the ticket it says entrance from 1st of July without.,0
It's been changed. Entrance without booking is from Saturday at 8 pm or when the entrance area has cleared  whichever comes first.,0
Could the new RoskildeNyt be uploaded here http://roskilde-festival.dk/om_roskilde/frivillig/roskildenyt/?,0

When do you usually announce the headliners ?,0
This is probably a silly question  but for some inexplicable reason last year's transport situation seem a bit hazy to me.  According to Roskilde Municipality (and Journeyplanner  for that matter)  Darupvej is still accessible with the 212 bus up until and including friday the 26th (http://roskilde.dk/nyheder/roskildedk/vejspaerring-under-festivalen). Can you confirm that?  And the waiting area in West is accessible when walking from Idrætscentret  right?,0
Will you show the men's football u21 semifinals anywhere? :),0

Congratulations to Bjørn Ivar Liland who has designed this T-shirt design  which will be our official T-shirt for 2014. Expect it for sale in the new year.  Question is now if we should produce some guitar picks to go with it?,13
Do fat people need bigger guitar picks?,0
Bigger guitarpick and just wider around the waist. I bought að Roskilde shirt that was XXXL then I found out that was just much longer but not that much wider. I'm 206 cm tall and bulked up so it would be nice to get a fitting shirt! :),0
Ditte Marie Tygesen  using a guitar pick as part of a design has been used many times before  we're sure. Even before Sziget's. We like this one much better  though  -),0
Sounds like a great offer - it is  alas  just a rumour without much truth to it.,0
Lou Reed R.I.P. I will always remember his concert @ Roskilde Festival on Sunday afternoon in year 2000. I still remember when he played Perfect Day in the sun. The Rock will miss him alot :/,0
Yoooooo..bring  Infected Mushroom    Savant og Pretty Lights to this show  and i will shit bricks... in a good way <3 <3 <3,0
aje! These guys know how music should sound like!,0
Much too early to say  we're afraid.,0
99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 11 12 2013 and see you next year and please book AC/DC  Foo Fighters  Slash  Paul McCartney  David Bowie Blur and Black Sabbath :),0
We recently donated 500 000 DKK to brand-new skating ramps at Musicon in Roskilde. It feels good to be non-profit!  Here's perhaps the best ever rollerblading video we've seen from Roskilde Festival. It seems fit for the occasion!,30
Hey did Avicii play at Roskilde recently? If so which stage?  ,0
Who did the best T-shirt design? They're all audience-made - and one will be produced.  https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151596387866706.1073741890.10248811705&type=1  Go here and vote for your favourite before Monday 28 October at 12:00,10
I have been reading the comments regarding the bands that were announced today! And with sadnees i would like to say that i am from a country where we are learning not to be aggressive with the preferences and points of view of other people and finding that here its not accepted is dissapointing.   O thing that it would be good if people understand that the good thing of a music festival is interacition  getting to know  discover and accept that all of us dont have the same perspective and taste. Also to understand how important it is not to demerit the work of the artist that come here just beacause they are not our kind of music. Have you any idea of how much work its involved in the making of eac of those sounds? Have you ever stop to see what is behind each song? This is a multicultural music festival  which means that all sort of musical tastes are welcome  It is sort of a union of sound from all around the world.That is something inspiring if you can see it from a diferentpoint of view.  In conclusion ENJOY AND IF YOU DON`T LIKE IT KNOW IT. IF YOU DON`T WANT...then dont go....  happy Thurstday,0
We know you have been waiting. And we have been working. Now it's finally time to kick-start the 2017 season!  Music for the curious-minded. (At least) 12 acts will be announced for Roskilde 2017 on Thursday. Yes  we’re STILL working on it…  Watch this space...  Photo by Kim Matthäi Leland,66

Sign painter and former graffiti artist Steve Powers has the prestigious job of painting the grandstand wall by Orange Stage this year. We met him in his NYC-studio for a chat about Roskilde...   He needs your input to create something that represents the overall Roskilde vibe at the big wall. All you need to do is share some good and fun stories  one-liners  feelings or anecdotes about Roskilde Festival and he'll take it from there. Powers' own idea is going towards ‘Good attitude manufacturing’ – What’s yours?   Comment here or talk to him on the festival site.,8

Three out of all voters will win a T-shirt with the winning design.  Deadline: Monday 28 October at 12:00 CET.  These 10 designs were picked by our jury. Thanks to everyone who submitted designs!,14
I only like 2 designs.,0
The 'guitar pick' one for sure. I don't get why you put a camp t-shirt (Alien & Cow) into the contest.,0
Number 6 design is definitly the best!,0
Some nice designs  prefer the pick one  plus you can sell picks with the design on it as well  ),0
Like the 3rd and 4th - both with a psychydelic style...,0
THIS ONE!!!,0
All the shitty options. Vote for NONE !,0
I like them all  but the Alien & Cow is great.,0
Still Think This Is Much Better!!,0
The white t-shirt absolutely!,0
I'm a bit sad that the alien and cow aren't in the lead  but not as much as I'm disappointed that the guitar pick is. Talk about a generic t-shirt  jesus fuck.,0
I will not  like  just to vote for a band...,0
Then don't.,0

Hei!  Jeg tenkte å sykle direkte fra min hytte (Mandal  NO) til Roskilde festival. Lurer derfor på om noen kan si meg hvor mange dager man vil bruke på å sykle fra Hirtshals til Roskilde? (beregnet ca 70km om dagen)  (If Norwegian is too troublesome for you):  I'm about to travel directly from my cabin (Mandal  NO) to Roskilde festival by my bicycle  and in that case I wondered if anyone could tell me how many days it'd take from Hirtshals to Roskilde? (Hitting for aprox. 70km a day)  På forhånd takk :),0
Read about it here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/naar_indgangene_aabner/,0

We've just donated DKK 500 000 (EUR 67 114) to Trampoline House  a community center in Copenhagen that provides refugees and asylum seekers with a place of support  community and purpose.  In our opinion  asylum seekers bring resources and can contribute to our community - but only when meeting people and not being isolated at asylum centres. Trampoline House provides help with exactly this.,57

Ah  like that. We thought you really disliked the donation. We're glad to find that isn't the case.,0
Point 4.... is getting harder and harder every year.... I am quite determined to attend my 19th Roskilde  but as none of my wishes has ever come true I am finding it difficult not to repeat whishes,0
Daft Punk just made this website http://alive2017.com/ Hoping you're on top of this Roskilde Festival :),0
You can't really be sure that it's not just some fanboy pulling your leg though.,0
Hehe yes of course. There's some interesting stuff in the source code though. And a clock counting down to 27th October 2016. Guess we just have to wait and see.,0
Anders Goberg I know – it's actually very well made,0
Another group of cool enthusiasts receives a donation from Roskilde Festival Charity Foundation.  www.drozdailysteezin.dk is a blog and a party organiser – a group of young people with the vision to create the best platform for hip-hop/grime culture in Denmark.  DDS was part of shaping the programme at our Ghettoblaster at Roskilde Festival 2016. The ambition  the will and the hard work that DDS put into the project are impressive. And it deserves support.  Therefore  Roskilde Festival Charity Foundation has chosen to support DDS with DKK 40 000 to help them with future projects.,14
Haha?? i just hate that shit. To expensive ??,0

More  Free Cheese  on camping - duely noted :-),0
Everybody loves cheese. Especially in the morning! Free cheese instead of morning beer. Mmmmmm cheeeseeee  ,0
Just a question.  When it says on the programme that Pretty lights will be playing on saturday. at 02.30... Isn't that really on morning Sunday 2.30am?   (No't trying to be a wanker  I just don't wanna be 24 hours ahead of time  or too late),0
yep  that is sunday morning,0
Hi Jj - yeah  they do play sunday morning 2.30  but in our programme we also place the acts that are playing after midnight in the same day schedule as the acts playing before midnight.,0
On Roskilde  a new day starts at 05:00.,0
No. This is probably to prevent forgery.,0
South 1 and West 2 should still be possible. And as Anders Cold says  you can get in saturday.,0

It said „Whoops  looks like something went wrong“ three times in a row. :( Maybe it’s just my internet-connection... Whatever  I will just submit my wishes here  maybe they will be heard.  - Feed Me: Jon Gooch is probably one of the most talented and unique electronic producers/DJs out there and has a sound that Roskilde hasn’t heard much of yet. I think his setup would look incredibly amazing on Apollo and give the stage a face! goo.gl/Rp8KhP  - Pretty Lights: Derek has just played Roskilde in 2012  but his new setup (a mixture of live-band and Ableton) and album have changed his performance a lot! He is one of the most gifted producers when it comes to creating musical experiences that are just what Roskilde seeks. And if you choose him  please give him a bigger stage than Apollo to play on… goo.gl/wgJUsm  - Woodkid: With his current hits running through tv and radio Woodkid is an obvious “must see”. The music composed by Yoann Lemoine has soul and an incredible atmosphere. goo.gl/cv0sJS  - The Black Keys: The duo consisting of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carny (I know they are supported by other musicians on stage  but they are still considered a duo) has made it to great success trough the last couple of years and their name is long overdue to be on the posters of Roskilde. goo.gl/mXNpri  - Parov Stelar: Electroswing is one of the best compromises for electro-lovers and older generations. And Marcus Füreder is beyond question the leading name in this genre. His live performance with the live-band is outstanding. goo.gl/um38hR   Sorry for the long post...,0

One man and his guitar on the most iconic stage in Northern Europe.   Enjoy Kris Kristofferson's #RF13 show. Have a great weekend.,18
When are you going to post the first bands?,0
Hey  I just saw that Volbeat will put footage from this years festival on their new live DVD. Will the whole show be up on the website sometime in the near future?,0
Looks like Daft Punk will play Glastonbury 2014  meaning they might be prepared to play other festivals. Is there any chance that Roskilde will attempt to get them to also play Roskilde 2014 ?,0

I was @ her gig in Morocco last friday. I would say her voice is 85% back still a bit raspy... So there might be more cancelations on the way :(,0
great. it's wonderful world.,0
Hey RF  the 'Share the feeling'-link on the page below doesn't work :(,0
The link is from jurassic ages. Meaning last year...,0
Thanx  we'll get it right!,0
Hep.....the website and forum is not working atm,0
Very annoying actually.,0
How am I supposed to hit 3000 posts before the festival if the forum isn't working :P,0
I noticed as well. Luckily I just managed to post before it crashed.,0
Green Day to play in London on july 1. Same weekend as Roskilde.  Please book them to RF 2017 :),0
Roskilde should book their own danish master of metal  King Diamond!  If not so   let us why not.,0
Some of these groups strongly recommended! 2017,0
Roskilde tents spotted in Uganda. Nice to see them used out in the big world.  Thanks for the pic  Rikke!,72
On a warm and sunny sunday afternoon James Blake gave an amazing performance at #RF13. Now you can enjoy the full show. Have a great sunday.,29
Not gonna happen..,0
They will play festivals next summer why not,0
Because they will be playing Tinderbox (or Northside)..,0
Yeah right. Are you working for them  ?,0
Denmark have too many festivals,0
Roskilde and Copenhell are the best.,0
Nope. But they are booked for Hurricane and Southside so far. Hurricane and Southside are a part of Scorpio just like Tinderbox and Northside.,0
Fuck that. Green Day should be back. Last time in  2005,0
Yeah  but dont get your expectations so high. I think that Guns n' Roses is a good guess on the other hand..,0
True also hoping for Guns n roses and Metallica. I Just want to see Green Day again.  Awesome show i saw in 2013 in Estonia and Denmark,0
Hey Roskilde Festival! I was wondering if you knew  whether the stores at the festival  will be selling tinned goods? Or food which we who bring a  Trangia  can cook at the prepared fireplaces. Sort of dinner like  not noodles!  -) Like tinned Ravioli or other dishes! And if you  or anybody else for that matter  have an idea of the price for such? Sincerest excited me!,0
Hello! I am dreaming of going to Roskilde!  Looking for a ticket  with camping. Can anyone help a sister out?,0
Hi. My camp and I used the offer in get a place N (buy 10 tickets - get a 10x10 space area in N for free) - we plan on arriving at saturday at 16.00 when the gates open. How do we  claim  or get acces to  our  space in get a place N?,0
Everything you need to know about entrance.   Waiting areas open on Friday 26 June at 16:00. To enter the waiting areas both a valid ticket and entrance booking for the preferred area is required. The entrance booking voucher will be scanned at arrival.  Once the camping area opens on Saturday 27 June at 16:00 you will get a temporary wristband. This needs to be exchanged into a regular wristband no later than Monday 29 June at 08 at the ticket houses in Entrance East and West.,25
Dear Roskilde can you please book Deftones? Thank you!,0
Skálmöld is much better than Hjálmar,0
Depends on who you're looking for  but Skálmöld are flipping goood!,0

Dette blev postet på festivalens intranet d. 11/06:  Vi følger billetsalget tæt Billetsalget følges i denne periode meget tæt  og vi har de store smil på. Alt tyder på et billetsalg i top fem af de afholdte festivaler – lad os krydse fingre for  at det holder.  Særligt har vi fokus på antal betalende gæster fra udlandet  og so far ser vi ud til at kunne holde niveauet med ca. 15-20 % udlændinge til årets festival.   Translation: We are closely monitoring the ticket sales In this period the ticket sales is monitored very closely  and we are wearing big smiles. Everything suggests a ticket sale in the top five of the held festivals - let us cross our fingers that it [continues that way].  Especially  we are focusing on the number of paying guests from abroad  and so far we are keeping up with the level of 15-20 % foreigners at this year's festival. ',0
On Friday  6 July at exactly 15:00 we are staging a mass Freeze Mob in the Social Zone.   At exactly 15:00:00 all participants are to freeze in place wherever they are in the Social Zone  and stay frozen for three minutes. At 15:03 everyone will unfreeze and act as though nothing unusual happened at all.   If you feel like participating then put it in your calendar right now with the alarm set!,0
and  what does this mean?,0
Good idea... but what is the purpose? Usually there is a cause behind a flashmob.,0
anyone know if the festival trainstation will be open on saturday 30 june ? or do i need to take the buss to entrance west ?,0
The train station will be open. First train going from Roskilde to the festival at 7:00 http://roskilde-festival.dk/praktisk/#c17825,0

Hey guys  We're two girls from Hamburg looking for a ride to Roskilde to join the fabulous festival (from late Wednesday onwards). Is anyone coming that way and willing to take us on the journey?   It Eva + Vera would be great hearing from you!,0
One of many things that make Roskilde Festival unique is the many impressive stereos built by our participants.  Did you have one as well? Let's see it...,18
Luckily i have not had a camp close to one of those  or i would go psychotic.,0
It is always a pleasure being a part of the party at Roskilde Festival. We just released our own After Party movie  go check it out! :),0
We used to.. But regretably not this year! #CoffinRIP,0
Martin Brow Nylev Theres a part of Beatrise!,0
My favorite was Camp Baguette. love them,0
 They want their party to draw the biggest crowd and one way to ensure that is by having the craziest build imaginable.    Unfortunately this is not what goes on a lot of the time  often the biggest builds are made up of haphazardly stacked speakers in a very unimaginative way  with no appreciation for ingenuity or creativity. It has become more of a  Who has the loudest bass . I saw way to many builds that were just regular speakers fitted in a box with wheels  where the only purpose was to pollute the soundscape. /rant,0
I didn't make it. I don't know the name of the people behind it  but I saw it one faithfull night at RF16 and snapped a picture. If this isn't the coolest stereo ever then I don't know what is!,0
A lot of impressive and loud soundsystems this year - but this one takes the prize.   It was even equipped with smoke-machine  a lot of lights  LEDs and discoballs for night-time party  and made R2D2-sounds when people walked by - AND it had incredible sound and competent DJ's as well!,0
The Kuwomba Stereo,0

Where can I buy this??!!,0
is it allowed to use photos from your page for the design?,0
Malte Blom Madsen  submit as many designs as you'd like. But we recommend that you put all your creative energy into one design.,0
Scott Hill  then see this an opportunity to make us a GREAT LOOKING one :-),0
Andreas Emil Forsberg  nowhere  unless this design wins the contest. We're just showing this as an example of what we've received so far.,0
Jacopo Asam  we prefer that you do an original design without using third party material.,0

In the months before Roskilde Festival 2013 we followed the Norwegian 'Coffin Camp' on their way to the festival. Well...maybe some of the content in the series was a bit made up and just for fun  but the camp is very real indeed  and so was the wedding.  All the best to you Coffin Camp  as well as to all of the thousands of wonderfull camps  that each year make Roskilde Festival the best festival in the world.  Love  togetherness   Orange Feeling  - we know where it comes from and who's making it real.  You.,3

You mean next year i guess.. anyways  Simon Madsen do your thing,0
Is there anywhere we can download the logo and other assets?,0
I never saw last years winner in the merchandise shop at Roskilde..?,0
No thanks  unfortunately I don't have a network of 1000 friends in order to win this competition.,0
Kenny Mark Kennedy :D,0
Can you make several pictures or only one per person?,0
Asbjørn  you're absolutely right. 2014  it is.,0
Martin Johnsson  we did a limited edition of the shirt - and it turned out to be very popular  so it sold out quickly. The winning design in this particular contest will be produced in a much larger stock,0
my guess is that is what removed due to its unpopularity,0
Simon Theis Jensen  we forgot about the logo  sorry. The news article is now updated with a download link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/93qw2o53hc5ozp9/e9OQxb9C6h,0
Martin Johnsson  on the contrary.,0
Read the rules. The winner won't be decided by Facebook-likes.,0
I did:  ...We then put it to the festival-goers to choose the final winner.  :),0
Martin  our experience from last year - when we also did this contest - is that the winner was not at all based on who-has-the-most-friends. And remember  we have a jury picking the 10 (presumably) best designs - making sure that all finalists have a certain quality.,0
We'll put it to the test: I'm gonna win this  dammit!,0
Good luck Anders!  (Not being ironic),0
Morgan Persson  feel free to submit more than one T-shirt design. But we do recommend that you put all your creative energy into one design.,0
I still think you are protecting the fact that it came clear to you that last years winner had spiderman-hands instead of rock and roll hand  making it a completely stupid tshirt. If it had been so populare as you say  why not sell it on the festival  as the competition promissed  and make a huge profit for the cause.,0
Martin Johnsson  we DID sell it at the festival. We had a stock of 500 shirts (as we said  a limited edition) which sold out at the festival.  You've made your point that you don't like the design.,0
Anton Demant Olin  bring us a GREAT idea and it doesn't matter too much if it's drawn by hand.,0
Were you being ironic when you said you weren't being ironic? ^^,0
Why is it so hard to be sincere on the internet... *sigh*,0
Because it lacks a little thing called facial expression and body language... Why doesn't somebody invent that?,0
Signe H. Neigaard  we prefer that you just do whatever seems best  and if we encounter technical issues we'll find a way. Can't wait to see your work!,0
No.,0
Look at their tour-plan  Anders.,0
It's not Oddfuture's tour plan. It's Trash Talk's.,0
The Sway Machinery are the replacements for Son Palenque. DJ Miles Cleret is playing as a resident dj in between acts on the Cosmopol stage Friday from 21.00 and onwards.,0

Thank you for that  but it does not show the Tenacious D concert :/,0
Is there a place where I can see that?,0
Unfortunately  they didn't allow on demand availability,0
oh okay :( you guys should make a dvd of all the concerts and sell them  that would be a great idea  ),0
I would personally buy it,0
See the info box in the right side on this page. That might give you an idea of when we start announcing acts  http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/about_the_programme/,0

Our ticket sale hasn't started yet. We'll let you know much more about prices and more soonish.,0

Remove Apollo from campsite G. and I'll be positive as well...,0
Would really be something – new album is great!,0
We have a winner!  Our audience jury has picked this photo as the very best one this year.  Congratulations to photographer Ana Santini - and thanks for everyone who has submitted photos. Remember to bring your camera in 2014 and we'll do another contest.,20
How did this win  when the picture of the Joker-crew got 500+ likes?,0
Waouuw ... Total freaky picture :-D,0
Allien whit a Tuborg sign nose  -),0
Julie + Anders  the winner was not decided by popular vote (i.e. Facebook likes) - but by an audience jury who picked out their favourite.,0
I remember sitting there in the spotlight  feeling like living art in a sea og joy and wonder,0
Facebook likes should never EVER decide a winner in a competition. There are easy ways to buy likes on facebook  and or getting friends friends friends friends friends friends n so on  to like your photo. I for one respect that a Jury decided instead of FB Likes  since its the most crooked system to rely on!  Great Photo!,0
i still believe the true winner should be Jonas Elsgaard,0
As i said before  it maybe should be a little more clear next year about how the voting is (i think most people saw it as likes  but it wasnt that clear that it was only a single jury  and not all audience). I was rather excited about how it turned out  when i saw the popularity about my photo :) So  thanks for the kind words about my photo(s)  and i will surely bring my camera again next year! Congrats to the winner also :),0
Congratulations! It's a really cool photo!  :-),0
This is  truly awesome.,0
Is that an Angry Bird left of the stage? Eyes made of light and a Tuborg beak! Love the photo by the way :),0
Here are the 10 finalists in the best photo contest.  Now it's up to the jury (consisting of both audience members and volunteers) to pick the final winner.  Who should win?,16

It's free if you book it with your ticket (http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/camping/entrance_booking/). Otherwise it has a fee on 20 DKK.,0
100% all wack - but in a good way we hope :-),0
No it's not free. Billetlugen charges 20kr no matter what. I just talked to billetlugen and they say that they are sorry but thats just the way it is!!!!,0
It is free to book an entrance  if you do it when you buy your ticket. The 20kr. added to the price is delivery  and fees..,0

Awesome with the New Apollo Stage! :-) What are you going to do with the old inflatable Apolle Stage? :-)  Kind Regards  Anders.,0
Hi Anders. Thanks so much! :) It's not certain what will happen to the old Apollo - only time can tell  ),0
You already know it! :D,0
Please book Blur for next year. I saw them last weekend in Berlin and they are still kick ass live in concert :),0
When you're HERE you help us help the world.  The number of poor people in the world is down to half AND an equal amount of boys and girls start attending school.  Roskilde Festival supports The World's Best News. More info here: http://verdensbedstenyheder.dk/english/  Photo: Charlie Markwick,20
Martin  the final accounts for 2013 aren't quite in place yet. Moreover  the profits aren't donated to just one cause but to several projects. And right now we're trying to involve YOU  asking you what we should donate to. More on that here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/charity_society/your_donations/,0

Another mainstream cover... how original Roskilde Festival  you haven't mentioned any rock / metal band a single time after it ended. Quite dissapointing.,0
Who would you like Roskilde Festival to support?  Roskilde Festival makes a profit because of your participation  and we'd like you to suggest charitable projects to receive a part of the profits from this year's festival.  Follow the link and nominate a worthy recipient.  You might know someone who is starting up a project  or maybe you have volunteered for an organisation that you think deserves a donation from Roskilde Festival? Let us know!  The nomination must focus on less inequality  one of the 17 UN world goals for sustainable development  and the project/organisation must seek a socially responsible and sustainable development of society by means of involving young citizens.,140
Unwanted/discarded animals  cats  dogs  any unloved/mistreated animal!!!,0
I would like roskilde festival to support environmental project such as re forestation  preservation of species or sea habitats. I think our planets deserves attention. People are too many  while lots of animals are disappearing because of our inconsiderate reproduction and usage of resources! - alternatively focus on spread the knowledge about contraceptive methods in overpopulated countries? that will help..(maybe),0

Red hot chilli peppers so they can get a new lead singer and pay someone to arrange a stage show for them.,0
I have been trying to formulate for some time  but... I would like that you donate to Daft Punk in a way so that they play next year. Alive again?,0
I would invest in Rockslide by paying the  GOOD  bands to tour across the states playing venues and build notoriety  I am sure booking will be very easy when you mention the show is free. Either that or put in a wave pool.,0
I think that Team Tvilling deserves a donation. They are a 'small' firm that does such a big difference for disabled people in wheelchairs. They are so inspiring and personally I've experienced so much joy and happiness through my dear friend Jakob. It's been such a pleasure to see all these wonderful people get to do sports and enjoy life in a different way than they are used to! I know that they have a limited amount members because of the expensive running wheelchairs. I wish that everybody in wheelchairs one day get to do the sports they like! Thank you for this year's amazing festival ?? #RF16,0
Humanity In Action please. Anything to help improve the integration of mixed cultures like Roskilde Festival does is a great thing ??,0
Atheist and/or secular movements in the middle east,0
It pains me to see how we treat other humans. I would like to see support going to refugees who fled their whole life due to a war they haven't asked for. I would like to see the festival that gathers tens of thousands of people in an ad-hoc city to entertain the idea of building cities or structures for the poor. They might be the poor of another country  but that is your fellow human as well. Humanity doesn't stop at the boarder #RF16,0
I would like to suggest Dream Center. They reach out to the poor and needy in the city of Los Angeles. http://www.dreamcenter.org,0
Roskilde Festival  I would like to suggest  that you give some money to Toender Festival - They are short of money  and have been struggling to survive for three years - They have had a little priofit for years  but now they are coming up again - It would be a great opportunity  to show your support of other festivals  and show some solidarity  with a little festival  that is known in all of Europe to be the best folk/roots-festival in nothern europe - Think of it :-),0

In India  many women are forced to stay home instead of going to school. The result is that women do not get an education and a job that can help grow the society for millions of people.  One of the major reasons is that the Indian women are not allowed to use tampons  and sanitary napkins are too expensive. This problem is a taboo in India  and a subject that is not discussed.  But we can help them. Kolding based Real Relief has developed a cheap and reusable antibacterial sanitary napkin that may solve this situation. Unfortunately  the Indian population is too poor to buy them.  If Roskilde Festival would donate reusable sanitary napkins to India  many women would be able to receive an education and eventually a job. Stand up for women in India. Give them the opportunity to live the life they actually need and deserve.,0
The volunteers,0
Me. I would really like a new car!,0
Should help refugees in Denmark  that would show how much difference Roskilde Festival is making on a national level. It is also easy for the contributors to see what happened with the money.   The youth of Denmark are ashamed of the current refugee policy and it would also be great that Roskilde festival made a decision that reflects the political view of its contributors.   In the end maybe we could also help the poor migrants that collect bottles at Roskilde  I know that their summer is tough and that we could show more compassion..   Let the help have two goals.  1. To help people in need 2. Bring awareness to Roskilde Festival  3. Show the contributors where the money went  and that is easier if we help people we can see  that will motivate people to keep giving..,0
Is there any way of making a more PR oriented way of spreading the #pardonsnowden message. I think that snowden's participation and messages should be spread around more  reach more people and inspire  people to not blindly accepting EndUserLicenseAgreements and such  to beeing able to use some rediculous application and thereby giving more information than you really want. Like some kind of information from a reliable source on where to take care. Good information :),0
you can support me economically since studying in Denmark is happening to be so fucking expensive,0

What if i sent some pictures a couple of days ago  and not one of them is there?,0
I wasn't there this year and I don't even fancy Metallica but the picture by Rasmus Bruus Larsen of the Metallica concert is in a class of its own: the mist  the light  the masses  the energy  even the Danish flag is there. The other pictures show mostly the fun and quirky side of the festival  which is great. However  Rasmus' picture is so intriguing and inviting that it enables the viewer to imagine the smell of the mud beneath  feel the chill of the night  and hear the roar from the masses. Congrats Rasmus  I believe you're the winner. You shot a historic picture of Roskilde Festival 2013.,0

Hi Roskilde Festival. Being an electronic music lover and all  ever since the map for this year came out I've been wondering how transport between Apollo and the rest of the festival is going to be? Will there be an entrance in the north-western corner of the festival site near Odeon? Or will I have to walk all the way to the southern end of C and from there north just as far when  say  I want to see Addison Groove 22.00 at Apollo and then 120 Days 23.00 at Odeon? And how come you haven't placed Apollo in the former gravel pit area?  I'm really excited to find out how this all works out  and thumbs up for the design of apollo! Looks amazing to me  wierd and contemporary/futuristic like the artists that have been booked to play there!,0
There has always (as far back as I can remember) been an entrance to the festival site in the northwestern corner  near Odeon. You just follow the paved road – Darupvej. The gravel pit area isn't suitable for neither camping nor traffic yet  because the soil has to settle.,0
Take a look at this! Roskilde Festival’s new electronic stage has found its shape. With its futuristic  cocoon-like appearance Apollo is unlike anything  Roskilde (or any other festival) has featured before!,22
would love to play there. http://www.tunnelmental.com/t.e.a.dance2012/t.e.a._dance.html,0
Amazing!! Thank you for realizing  that the electronic music is so popular :),0
I think it'll be known as the Lemon stage ( Citronen ). Frankly  I think it looks horrible but I see the general idea behind it for mobility purposes.,0
this is what gets *popular* in Electronic Music these days. Lazy,0

Okay  it's been awhile but in 2014 I will (finally) return to Roskilde! I have the time  I have the money  and I still have the plastic farm animals and new T-shirts to give away! Hope to see everyone in 2014 & greetings from Los Angeles!,0
You guys at the festivaloffice must really dislike metalfans since you only book a handfull of metal acts and then put half of them at the same time on sunday.Lol. But I guess you could get away with almost anything this year since you booked Bruce.Soon it is festival time again :-) ,0
Handfuls are pretty big lately  I've heard. I count fifteen metal bands plus five hardcore/punk bands to boost. Refused being one of the latter  there's something to check out  even if you're not at all into hardcore. Their song  New Noise  is namecheck by even guys like RATM as being one of the greatest tunes ever.,0
Plus: A little insider info: The clash Sunday is unavoidable. Nasum couldn't be there any earlier  Machine Head couldn't swap with Amadou & Mariam because of the latter's travel plans. Sometimes the puzzle pieces doesn't fit better together than this.,0
Anders do you whork fore RF or you dont accept criticism at all,0
I am a subcontractor  admittedly  but moreso a festivalgoer – I think it's my 14th year in a row this year. Criticism is completely fine with me  and I also think we could do with a metal headliner  but a handful of bands is objectively not 15. A handful is five bands or less. So I think Johan either missed a lot of the metal that's actually there or only counted the subheadliners. Either way  this isn't the best Roskilde year  metal-wise  but it's a stretch to lay it out as Johan does – that the bookers hate metal. The opening act on orange is a metal name  so obviously they don't.,0
I promis you Johan E know he's Metal he's not missing enething. And Johan E stopp taking shit abaut RF festivaloffic they are my GODS,0
My first year at RF was 1992  so I really like the festival I must say.Thank you for the explenation about the sunday.Yes  I really miss a big metal name this year.Only smaller metal acts this year.,0

Why  I have to think my husband in mind...! :-),0

War For Youth is TWO bands with very similar styles  combined. They made a split 7  together called 'The Glass House Etiquette'  but their album releases are also pretty representative of their combined sound.,0
I'm coming from Australia  and whoever had the bright decision to have Bruce Springsteen and Bon Iver at the same time needs to rethink. I think we should partition to get the times changed. Who's with me?,0
It probably won't happen. Bon Iver at Arena requires another big name to play at the same time elsewhere at the festival site. Otherwise  too many people would flock to that stage  which could potentially result in a dangerous situation. With as big a crowd as Roskilde's you sometimes have to think along these lines too.,0
Lets get Green Day to Roskilde next year :) ,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  what about Garbage in 2017 ? Their latest album is purely Amazing!,0

@Roskilde artist booking. I go to Roskilde every year  this year was really good  a lot of people thought it would not be  but they were wrong. I think Richard Ashcroft gives one of the best live shows  his show with The Verve on Glastonbury in 2008 was awesome. It would be really cool if Roskilde were to book Richard Ashcroft for next years Roskilde Festival.  ,0
Roskilde will and forever be one the most important experiences of my life. I first came here in 2011 to see Portishead and didn’t realise what would happen next. Roskilde has led to me experiencing the beautiful country which is Denmark  where I have made some great lifelong friends  and has inspired me in all elements of my life. I have also has the pleasure of living in Copenhagen and currently learning the language. Roskilde has completely changed my life. However I will be 35 next year and that means starting a new chapter and becoming a bit more mature. This means that Roskilde 2017 will be the last ever camping music festival I will be attending and what a place to make my retirement. The point of my message is if you could please make the effort to book these artists you will send me off in style.   1) Jay-Z (I have got a feeling he will be releasing a new album this year).  2) Arcade Fire (Same feeling)  3) Banks  4) Bloc Party  5) Taylor Swift  6) Catfish and the Bottlemen 7) Chemical Brothers  8) Christine & the Queen 9) D’Angelo 10) Daft Punk (Mission Impossible) 11) Dolly Parton  12) The Editors  13) Empire of the Sun  14) FKA Twigs  15) Fleetwood Mac  16) Haim  17) Joanna Newsom  18) Justice  19) M.I.A  20) Massive Attack 21) Mumford & Sons  22) Nero 23) Nas 24) Paramore  25) Pendulum 26) Radiohead  27) Sia  28) Skrillex 29) Slaves 30) St Vincent 31) The Beach Boys 32) The Killers 33) The Libertines 34) Tricky  35) Two Door Cinema Club 36) Warpaint 37) Weezer  38) Wiley  39) Blink-182   I hope I can at least cross off ten artists from the list above.   Thank you for reading and I really appreciate the hard working you have put in to making Roskilde one of the best festivals on the planet. I will do my part to get the next generation of Belmoh’s to attend your amazing event.    Peace out  Matty.,0
We're thrilled to hear that you've had such smashing experiences here.  Time will tell who will end up in the 2017 line-up. But we'll do our best to make it grand!,0

At Roskilde Festival 2016  Edward Snowden gave a talk to the biggest crowd he's ever addressed.  But only after the activist art group The Yes Men had (intentionally) pissed people off by making them think the festival was collecting all their data. See how surprised the festival-goers really were.,145

Hej Anders  the padlocks are not the same as the ones at the picture  so need to worry  you beer will be completely safe.:),0
Hi! I ordered one and it sounded from the email like I needed to bring my PayPal receipt with me  is that correct? A tip for you guys would be to make your website available in English too (or maybe it is and I missed it).,0
The email also seemed to mention something about a deposit. Is that included in the 400kr I paid or do I need to take an extra 50?,0
Good to hear!  ) Loosing cold beer on a hot day at Roskilde must be the worst. Looking forward to use one of these.,0
Victoria Witthoff the 400 is including the deposit  we will return that to you after the festival. you dont need to bring you paypal receipt  that is only for those how do not pay through paypal.. So you have done everything right and the Cool box will be ready for you when you come..:),0

I hope that by 'food scraps'  you mean 'left-over food'?,0
Veronica  yeah  we didn't empty other people's plates into a big pot. We're talking about fresh produce.,0
I assumed that was the case  ) But until you get to the word 'homeless' at the end of the first sentence  it sounded like you'd found a solution for all the food waste from the festival!,0

2014 is gonna be my 16th year straight and my wifes 10th year. She is giving birth to our baby in october but I would be surprised if that would stop her from going and having her big anniversary next year for at least part of the festival.  So actually our baby was on it's first festival this year  though still in the womb. My wife said that it went totally nuts in there during some of the rock concerts. It is very promising.  ),0
Get Foo Fighters AC/DC and Blur to play in 2014 :),0
I never miss Roskilde  very well run festival  this year 2013  was really good. I go to many festivals each year  Roskilde ranks very high up the ratings for so many reasons.  I would love to see Richard Ashcroft ( The Verve ) play Roskilde  he is one of the best live acts to ever play Glastonbury... Can you look into perhaps booking him for Roskilde 2014 ?,0

sounds good to me,0
Simon - impressive. See you in July  -),0
Let's hear it. What is the greatest challenge Roskilde Festival is facing right now?,6
Garbage on the camping site,0
Destructive spirit of an increasing number of participants: racism  violence  harassment etc.,0
Joan Jett  Alice Cooper  PIL  Hawkwind  X  Off!  Black Flag  Jello Biafra  Buzzcocks  Peter Hook  AC/DC  Kiss  Misfits  Iggy And The Stooges  Saint Vitus  Pentagram  and 1000 more    Hvor svært kan det være? :-),0
hundreds of gypies and chinese who collect bottles  cups..and whatever else they find...thievery in the camping areas  and security problems,0
Hygienic condisions.. Felt like I was living in the slum  instead of a campingarea And garbage I know it's a festival but I have been to others  and this was bad.,0
The Roskilde Festival needs to stop reserving big parts of the most popular camping sites in the P area to all kinds of schools. I don't mind you being friendly and reserving for a lot of people  but this needs to be done in the back of P and not in the spots that people have been camping outside for hours/days  to try and place their camp at.,0
Stupid hip-gangster-wannabee's and therefore shittychitty  music  - summing up  - the greatest challenge you are facing is that of the shrinking of your balls ! Kick the comitee and bring back one of europe's largest rock festivals as it once was ! Now  I can do the job if you really want me to   but you'll have to pay me seriously well after all the shit you pulled on me throughout the past years ! Give me an offer on growapair@rihanna.com   if you want an action plan. First free advice   delete your Facebook   that shit aint rock'n'roll - peace,0
Garbage removal @ Camp sites ..  Been terrible the last 2 years .,0
Getting Daft Punk to Roskilde 2014,0
A major campsite issue is:  The relationship between the desire to build a large music system and having a really bad taste in music.,0
That I can't get there,0
More security on the caming area. Those gypsies are stepping way over my personal line. A guy this year took my bottle  and I told him it's for water  and he was all NO in my face. What the hell?,0
I think it is a problem that Roskilde is trying to stray from many of the things we used to love about the festival. My friends and I used to come to Roskilde to enjoy music we wouldn't have a chance to hear any other place  that includes both up-coming artists  small  weird  bands  but also the biggest bands of today. That said  our experience is that when Roskilde is bringing more and more electronic music and such (which I have nothing against) it is bound to draw a lot of different people besides the peace-loving hippie and the harmless metal-head. Therefore in my experience Roskilde is having a lot more problems with aggressive people and unpredictable drugs. That is sad because Roskilde used to be the only place on earth where everybody would help eachother.,0
Getting back to being a ROCK festival.. Not a RhiannaKindaPopFestival..  Love being there  but this year the music was a bit crappy ??,0
To redeem yourself from last years program. Nothing wrong with the small bands  but the big bands were not satisfactory to anyone.,0
The increased use of smartphones  pads  cameras  computers etc that need charging made the lines at the charging stations pretty silly at times and the efficiency wasn't all that great either.  I know you had the alternative with the VOLT-thing  but how many used that?,0
Being greater than the year before :-),0
Getting Queen to play orange stage,0
GARBAGE ( cool band by the way) is certainly a great challenge. The garbage problematic is complex and needs different approaches to solve. I know that clean camping areas has increased and maybe this is the time where you could make a twist on the concept and let the clean areas be  standard  and the rest named  trash- area  or the like. Besides that improve and keep focus on art/  fun  activities/ enlightening -projects like the garbagetower etc.,0
Dry places to sit when it rains  and shade when sun is out....,0
Garbage - more bins in the csmping area maybe have one on each corner..,0
Getting a strong line-up to get us outa the campsite and over to the stages... If it wasn't for the feelgood factor known as  The Orange Feeling  Roskilde would die on it's feet. I am from Ireland and have been to Roskilde 8 times. I am tempted to go somewhere else next year because the line-up keeps failing.,0
Direct link to CHANGE -> http://tagdel.dk/challenges/1984 - write you comments in there and they'll be read by hundres of engineers and creative minds working together to make an even greater festival.,0
Like in society  the biggest challenge Roskilde Festival is facing right now  is the mindset of its' citizens.,0
Roskilde you got a big challenge in getting the music programme back on track. It has been a long decline from the nineties through the noughties until now. It's not all in your power to change but the music program was better back in time.,0
Huge-ass stereos that sound like shit and waste a lot of energy compared with the output. Solution: Ban all forms of car batteries  or take it further and ban all forms of acid batteries. :),0
Roskilde festival har solgt sin sjæl til djævlen.  Danske Bank og en gammel revisor til at styre biksen har gjort RF til en profitmølle. There is no Orange feeling.  There is only green feeling and it is really sad.,0
get a bigger pavilion stage,0
I would like to see industrial/ebm/goth bands added to the line up,0
It would be nice to have toilets in the middle of the campsites as well  maybe that would solve the  let's all pee at the side of the camp  problem. Tent was floating in pee and other human fluids at the last days...,0
The developement in line-up is fine. It's a musicfestival not a metalfestival. Varied music belong here and makes it the most interesting festival. Here you can discover in all directions but jazz (a mistake?) - I love most genres  even pop  RnB  hiphop  electronica and metal!  -) I find as much Orange Feeling now as in the 90's. Then people were more like  I'm partying you do as you can  - Now people are more welcoming (thanks to RF active trying to change attitudes  with prizes for camps welcoming strangers and so on). But OK I did see some stupid teenagerboys throwing little empty glassbottles in the crowd at Metallica. Well fuckers have pissed in glasses for years and throwing them at the crowd. Then theres the problem with garbage: Its HUGE - but that can be solved easier. Your problems all come from LACK OF RESPECT FOR OTHERS - kids that don't give a fuck ruin the orange feeling. You have to work on peoples respect for others in all ways - like you did with camp of the year (welcoming people at parties) ... Free tickets for cleen camps? for orange feeling? Make it somehow prestigious - backstage visits? An easy to spot Tshirt? A chance to watch from vip lounge? A chance to announce favourite band? A drink-card? A wall of fame? Name in programme? Options  are many ... Carry on - your mix of genres is fine.,0
And the white toiletwaggons are a winner - the green plastic-ones are so pukeable shitty - no more plastic-ones just the white real toilettes. Please.,0
And WHY do you ask our opinion here and them want us to repeat ourselves someplace else. Why dont you paste and copy or get your people to read this instead????,0
Well - then you just copy and paste or get your people reading this :-),0
I personally think it's great  that there is such a big variation of acts playing every year  but it could be a chanllenge if you continue to put the focus mainly on electronical music. The Apollo stage is really loud and dominating  and it seems it's mostly the younger audience who likes it. It's important to keep on getting new audience for the festival to survive in the future  but just be sure you don't neglect the 'older' people :) In my camp we're between 26 and 35 years old  so we're definitely no spring chickens in Roskilde-years  but we're very loyal Roskilde fans (some people in the camp has been there every year since 1996!)  so remember to book a bit of all the stuff that isn't just what the kids want  ) We love Roskilde Festival and would like to keep coming back in many years to come.,0

MISS THE ORANGE FEELING? http://helenalundquist.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/the-orange-feeling-roskilde-festival-2013/ Photos by Helena Lundquist,0
Dear Roskilde.   If you don't want to neglect the metalheads this year  I sure hope you will reconsider your sunday evening - By having Behemoth only 1 hour before Machine Head and Nasum 1 hour after  you're squeezing the three biggest metal acts this year  into space that's not gonna fit.. It's very sad :(  If you switch Amadou & Miriam with Machine Head  you can please us all very much  since Nasum propably won't play for that long (since they're grindcore..) - this way there will be 30 minutes of air between each of the many metal concerts on the sunday. And if it doesn't happen  I trust that you've done everything you can.. Thanks :),0

Fuck I miss Denmark.  I've seen a video of one of the most epic moments out now for a little bit. But I didn't think it did the moment enough justice.  I happened to be there and my camera happened to be on.  So here's a sneak peak from my upcoming video (bit swamped atm  I'm getting round to it) entitled Dat Orange Feel  http://youtu.be/jY-FZ9zewSg Thank you Roskilde for the awesomeness.,0
500 camps were part of Clean Out Loud at Roskilde Festival 2016! The biggest number of participants so far. Well done for creating an amzing party and fantastic events for your neighbours and the rest of the festival-goers - and cleaning up nicely after yourselves.,19
All of Roskilde should look like this always.,0
Even on the last day  it looked amazingly clean compared to G :o  Edit: Compared to everywhere...,0
Woa! That's a huge difference!,0

Hi! Are there people who volunteered at the restaurants of the festival the previous years or know people who did? :),0
It would be awesome if we got Anthony B to the festival :3,0

Kenni  we have lots of camping space  so don't sweat it.,0
 Roskilde is about so much more than its bands. It's about passion. Passion for music  passion to volunteer  passion to look after the environment and one another  and passion to succeed at being one of the best festival experiences in the world.  - Gigwise,24
Passion to look after the environment? Yeah! Especially in camps :D,0
How about a purely vegetarian menu at Roskilde Festival? That would definitely be good for the environment,0
What a way to return to the Orange stage!,0

Hey Roskilde Festival! So check this out - Björk herself thought my entry to the contest was  very good  - how amazing is that? Really hoping that this will get me a few more votes so that I can fly all the way to Denmark to see all those incredible bands! Thanks for an awesome competition. <3 from South Africa.,0
Wow is that a miniature album?? Thats so amazing and accomplished! Talent like this should be rewarded with a trip to Denmark! Especially as from Denmark South Africa looks miniature (because it is very far away - thats called perspective). Thats a double layer of cleverness!,0

Hi guys.Just saw that Wacken sold out 2014 festival in 24h.I wonder how many tickets were sold to RF 13?,0
Yes it is amazing that Wacken were sold out so fast. 77 500 Full Festival tickets and 5 000 one-day tickets for each day were for sale for this year’s Roskilde Festival. Friday and Saturday were sold out and Full Festival tickets were very close to be sold out. We don’t have the exact number  but in total well above 80.000 tickets.,0
Excellent! I Will comeback at RF next year for my 17th festival since 1992 :-),0
Johan: Wacken sold out in less than 48 hours  not 24. But indeed very impressive. Roskilde is Roskilde and that is why we all love it so much. I look incredible much forward to my 10 year anniversary next year. 03  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13 & 14! My tattoo will be somewhat brilliant - I promise! :D,0

Dear Roskilde organizers  I'm an Israeli guy who's planning to come to the festival. I'm afraid that if I buy tickets today  the tickets won't get here by the time I'm leaving for the festival (I'm also planning to travel in Europe for a few days before Roskilde). Is it possible to order tickets without the shipping (I couldn't find a way to do it on the website). Is there any box office I can collect my tickets from? When will the tickets be shipped if I order today?  Thank you very much! Amir. ,0

Please send your questions to accreditation@roskilde-festival.dk as this admin doesn't know the details,0
Look further down the wall. Roskilde Festival estimates that the volunteers missing are a meagre few compared to the blown up numbers circulating in the media.,0
Kristian  think for a moment why you'd want to volunteer (if you do at all). We'd like to believe that people are part of this mainly because they want to. Because they want to spend some of their spare time creating a big  unique event along with lots of other volunteers. And the end result  besides an excellent event  is that all profits are donated to charity. If you think of it like beging at work  you really shouldn't volunteer. That's the big  absurd comparison we've seen in various web media today. Volunteering is not work  and it never should be compared.,0
Odd that their representative called the issue a problem to be talen seriously then. But oh goodie we'll have our scoutleader policestate afterall... The logic is still missing. Why not just be honest and say it as it is. Money is the reason like anywhere else where people are expected to do more work for the same pay...,0
Which representative? Doesn't that representative only speak on behalf of one of the myriad of organisations with volunteers on Roskilde?,0
There is volunteering to create an amazing festival - and then there is volunteering to guard a gate nobody uses for three days...  I've done both at Roskilde Festival and asking people to spend 32 hours doing the latter is a bit ridiculous. The volunteers are a big part of the great event that is Roskilde Festival  but to suggest that it isn't like work for a lot of volunteers with frankly shitty jobs at the festival  is a bit naive. When you are sitting in the rain for 10 hours staring at nothing while great bands play  you probably start to wonder why you didn't just save up the money for a ticket. But if you participate in doing something fun like a theater event on the camp site or even something meaningful like painting a shed  it is completely different.,0
Ive been a volunteer at the festival half a dozen times  and Ive been happy to do my part to help the festival I really care about. But you are underestimating the festivalgoers sourly if you think they don't know why you've done this. The notion that what you are looking for is a change of culture amongst the volunteers is foolish and clearly false. Basically you're saying that you what event run by people who would rather work than play. A bit out of tune with the crowd  and in my opnion a bad idea. But I guess we will see. I dont expect Ill volunteer again under these circumstances  and if you think that good news  you don't know your strengths... see you at the festival  ),0
Kristian  money is the reason? Wrong. We don't pay societies any less just because we want volunteers to put in some extra hours. On the contrary. Things have changed over the years. Some time back the festival lasted 4 days and you typically volunteered for 3x8 hours. Since then we've introduced warm-up and 4 days have become 9 days. A longer festival. Three shifts in the course of 9 days have most often resulted in prople forgetting their instructions  no knowing who they're working alongside and so on. We'd like to change that for the better. And yes  that means more volunteering hours - because we believe it'll make the whole thing better. And we know that it isn't for everyone - and that's perfectly fine.,0
Søren  we know that some functions may be more exciting than others. But remember  you decide yourself what you sign up for. It's still volunteering - we don't twist anybody's arm here.,0
Not sure I accept the premise that a longer festival means longer shifts. If its not about the money why not simply increase the number of volunteers? Anyway you've made a better argument than the one about a change  of culture amongst volunteers  which is almost a slap in the face of the many who have helped the festival over the years and done a good job  despite preferring free time as a festvalgoer...,0
Yeah it's all volunteering - but you can't fault people for thinking 32 hours is tad over the top for many of the jobs (and BTW - not everybody can get the cool volunteering jobs). I just don't see the reasoning here. Why are volunteers who are willing to work so many hours better? What if you can't volunteer for 32 hours because you have a full time job? If you can't get to the festival until Thursday  32 hours is a loooong time. Not everybody has nine days at the festival. But anyway - no point in arguing. You'll do what you do and I'll use the ticket I bought. Because volunteering to be a human fence post just isn't worth it at my age.,0
Søren: At least one of your points are invalid. The one about working 32 hours purely within the four festival days  Thursday to Sunday: You're not required to do that. If your shifts are purely within those days  it's still the 24h rule that is in effect. It is only if some or all of your shifts lie within the warmup period or otherwise  that the 32h rule is enforced.,0
If we increase the number of volunteers the problem remains: too far between shits  forgetting instructions  lack of group cohesiveness. We don't believe that'll work.  Now that it's the football season you can compare it to a football team. If 11 players forget what they're supposed to do  they can't play together - and can't win in the end. And if there's a player who can't be bothered with playing  this player takes away the fun for the other 10 players. Roskilde is also a team effort! That's what works - and that's what makes it all wothwhile in the end.,0
Thanks for the football-metaphor it really makes it SO much easier to understand... oh wait. So you're implying that footballteams with many players on the team are weaker than those with few subs and reserves. Nonsense. You just divide them in to smaller groups that play at the same time. Thats what teams facing more matches do. And those with most players in the team usually do better  because their players are happier and less tired.  Have fun in the workcamp. Over out,0
Still it doesn't change the fact that with too much time between each shift  you often have to start over again because people have forgotten what they're supposed to do. More volunteers doesn't necessarily make a better Roskilde.,0
.. I think that most of the volunteers work at the festival  because they dont have money for a ticket.. a bonus by doing that is charity  not the driving force,0
Where does the 3 percent of your article on the website come from? For example. you do not know how many people my association is missing!,0

The best memory is from the Tenacious D queue  where we had a lot of fun with people we didn't know. There where singing  joking and lots of hugging ?? When the queue to Macklemore started to go into the pits we told them it was the queue to Kidd or Miley Cyrus which made some of them hurry even more ?? Thanks for the good hilarious queue! And I hobe you had a good trip home to Sweden  Bibi. And thank you to the awesome security guy who played a long with our bullshit.,0
By coincidence I meet 3 guys at Arena waiting for New Order. After a while we found out that we all had 30st anniversary at Roskilde. We had a small party before New Order gave a blast of a concert. Thanks to Martin and his friends and for Roskilde for making this happen - among other many many other things that you can meet new friends. 1987 was also a fine year with Iggy Pop  Leonard Cohen and The Cult. #rf16,0
I was standing in the from row at the « Gröna tältet » sorry (I was at Roskilde Festival  first time in 1987 as a 19 year old)  -) Arena stage @ New Order (WHAT A CONCERT !)…starting to feel bad (Panic Attack feelings) the chief nurse asked me how I was and I said not that good…instead of just lifting me over she asked…do you want to stay and I said « yes » with a shaking voice  « yes please »….she went away for a second and came back and said  Lars (in a very sweet calming Danish voice) everyone at security has an eye on you  continue to enjoy the concert and when it gets too much we lift you in. Bless that woman and all of you working there at Roskilde. I love you and WE love you and I want again want to thank that lovely nurse  who with I had a very good talk with afterwards.  #RF16 #RoskildeFestival #flaggalagga,0
My best #rf16 story has to be about what happened during the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy Concert... ... I had been on duty as a shiftmanager in my crew  from 05.30 am till 15.45pm  when my last volunteers on duty had reported back to me. It was a great shift  and I had even tried to skate around in the mud??.  But Dizzy Mizz Lizzy were to perform at the Orange Stage at 05.00 pm. And so two friends & I  went up to the stage to see the show. On the way I came across a camping chair which was standing alone with no owner around. I took it with me  because I knew I wouldn't be able to stand up the entire show.  And so as the show began  I sat down in the chair and enjoyed the afternoon sunlight and the music.  But after a few songs  I leaned back in the chair  and my eyelids got heavy... Suddenly one of my friends asks me loudly  hey Dorte... Are you a sleep? And I woke up and said  what  uh no  yeah... maybe. So I took a nap during the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy Concert  but  Waterline    I would if I could  but I can't   &  Silverflame  were awesome!??,0
During the festival this year  a danish woman contacted me through facebook & she wanted to meet up. - it was the woman living toghether with my cousin that I haven't seen for the last 39-40 years & since we have mutual friends on fb  she knew I was in Denmark. We all had a very nice aftrenoon in Roskilde when they were going thorugh town & this reunion wouldn't be possible without Roskilde festival. - the festival isn't only the music or people inside the fences- for me it's also a bridge to estranged familymembers :),0
I was really hungry and low on money  and my friend said i had some stuff to do. He came back with a burger to me  even tho he had almost no money either. He said i made the camp a whole lot better  so this was the least he could do. We then went to see muse A great evening  one of the best Roskilde moments,0
While my girlfriend  a friend and I were waiting for Tenacious D  the rest of our friends and campmates found us without knowing where we had placed ourselves. So we had a laugh about it  and since Orange is so huge  we couldn't really believe it :D But the best part about it  was when a dude from our camp joined us. He had a small speaker with him  and While being home  he had put the movie  The Pick of Destiny  down on his phone. So we sat there on the ground  watching a Tenacious D movie  before a Tenacious D show  and people around us joined in  when we all began singing Kickapoo. That was truly awesome  and that my dear friends  must be a perfect example of the Orange Feeling. People coming together because of the love of music <3,0
This years best story must be when my friend and I found a hula hoop and named it  the kissing ring . Then we went around making random people kiss by trapping both of them inside the ring. Complete strangers were kissing and it just shows how much love there is at Roskilde festival ?? it was a lot of fun. I hope we made some future couples with it,0
One of my great memories is from Roskilde 2013. A few from our Camp and I had been grocery shopping in Føtex in Roskilde City. In Føtex we got provided with free Captain Morgan T-shirts to the whole Camp. During the festival we had also made some kind of paper/tape hats. We looked amazingly stupid  but it gave us the Best Camp spirit! Afterwards we played football matches against our neighbour camps. It was so fun and really orange feeling.,0
My name is Juan  I am from Mexico and this Yeat i went to my first Roskilde. I was kind of worried bc I didn't have friends to go with  but that wasn't a problem. The first day I saw a mexican flag on a camp  so I decided to meet those guys and they were amazing  showing me how everyone in Roskilde are friends  they adopted me.  This was a rude year for me  lot of changes and worries. I went alone to sing with KAKKMADAFAKKA and when they play  Young You  something in the song make me cry so hard  I couldn't believe i was there  how I survived this year and I was there  and the best part was when a complete stranger hug me meanwhile i was crying. he didn't say a word just hug me until I stop. Even though I arrive alone to the festival I left with a new and amazing family of 130 000 persons. Those 7 days were the best day of my life.   ),0
One of my best moments  was with my best friend. We were having some food and was a little drunk and had totally forgot about the time. Suddenly we hear major lazer go on stage  so we just looked at eat other and ran!  We made to a good spot and the first 2-3 songs was amazing. Out of nowhere my boyfriend  his sister and my brother was standing right next to us  witch was a really nice surprise we all went crazy and had an amazing concert. My best concert memory because of all the surprises with all the people  I love the most ??,0
Drunk all the time,0
Roskilde has got a lot to do with me having appatite for all kinds of music. In 2004 the Ballroom stge introduced me to World Music - I never looked back since. There was this band called Gnawa Diffusion playing and the whole tent was jumping up and down. The looks on the band´s faces was something to see. Total unbelief and bliss. That year I practically lived in the Ballroom and saw what our planet has to offer outside the usual western radio hits. So thanks for that. <3,0
During this years festival  me and my two best friends  whom are also a couple  we where drinking all night  and we all just walked around Dream City and talked about our lives  our future and our friendship. At the end of the night  my friend took his girl up to the hill by the Dream City sign  he went down on his knees  and proposed to her. (Only for fun  because they wanted to get  Roskilde Married ). She got really happy  and they kissed and huggede  og yelled out loud  we just got engageded . It was so sweet and romantic  and a very intimate night for all of us. A night to remember.,0
The Best memory i have from Roskilde is when me and my Camp were playing  øl bowling/beer bowling  all Day long and we had so Much fun. It Will never be forgotten.,0
My gimmick this year was to have a daily reading of an erotic short story at the campsite. I'd brought my old porn magazines for the heck of it. First day had 20 attendees  second 30. Then I bet against my friend  that there wouldn't be more than 50 the next day. He went around and honestly did a horrible job of promoting the reading. I though I was a safe winner. Lo and behold - 50 didn't turn up. At the beginning of the thing my mates counted 96. Bet lost. Succes ensured. The Roskilde audience is amazing.,0
I bought tickets to Rf16 the day they came on sale  as I strongly believed that some  starman  would play on Orange after 20 years as the superheader. Those dreams were crushed in January  and I thought it would be nothing.   Roll up to Thursday  Orange after midnight. A band plays  the best song in the world   and during their roadcall about everyone on stage  Mr. Thomas Jacob  Jack  Black starts to sing on his part. And all of a sudden  he united me and thousands of others to sing Space Oddity with him. And it was truly beautiful.,0
No words needed??????????,0
One of my best moments from #rf16 must be one of the last impressions - at the The Minds of 99  last concert on Arena. The right band at the optimal stage and time. The sound was excellent  the crowd even more.  Friday  I had been to the hospital in order to get my third threatment of chemotherapy - an my expectations to the rest of the festival was that every moment would be a bonus - depending on my strength.  And suddenly I'm standing there  late  at 3 a.m.: in the middle of a singing  dancing  completely enthusiastic crowd   alongside some of my best friends with heavy goosebumps and tears of hapiness on both chins as the words  Jeg skal ud af min krop  mens jeg lever  mens jeg lever  skal jeg ud af min krop  embraces my body and senses as a mantra from the stage.  This will be printed in my memory the rest of my life as one of the best Orange feeling moments  and I am grateful for that.,0
The story about never being able to compete in this competition because I have never yet been on Roskilde festival ??,0
Well  this year me and My friend were standing in the queue for the fence to fall. In the middle of this warzone we got hushed away from two perfect spots for us! We kept running and felt like this is not going as planned  running from south entrence to the g-spot  ) there we were standing and in the middle of a sentence someone knocked me on the shoulder and said HEY DANIEL! And there stands my camp that i lived with in 2014  Trønderfari ??  And after that we had a wonderful festival week with the Trønds! Thanks for that Roskilde ??,0
At the festival in 2015  I went to see the final concert at orange (with suspekt) and of course it was running late so when I finally got back to my camp afterwards  the time was almost already 5 am. So instead of going to sleep my mates and I decided to sit down  pack our stuff and just relax before going home. One of my friends tho  she was a lot more drunk than the rest of us  so she was making a lot of noise. We all wanted to kill her when she pulled out a harmonica. But a few minutes in to the torture she was putting us all through (with her awful attempt to play) one of the camp  guards  whom was walking through the area  stopped and looked at my friend. We all said hi to him while my friend kept playing. All he did was say  no no no no no let me show you how it's done  followed by him taking out a harmonica  at 5.30 in the morning  playing for his life. We were all so tired  and sad that it was all over soon  but he really brought back the mood. Roskilde festival would be nothing without all the wonderful voluntary people  like him  that makes the festival run around. Thank you,0
No special story. Just 4 days of fun with a lot of happy people and great koncerts. What an amazing photo by the way. It is so great to see the orange feeling from the top. Looking forward to see you again next year for the 18th time.,0
This year was my fourth on Roskilde festival  and it was amazing as always! I don't have a special story to share  I just wanted to talk about the great people at the festival. Every year I've been to a different camp  one where I only knew a few of total. But every year I've been let in to the fun and everyone have been so nice! So thank you Roskilde  for bringing out that attitude and excitement in all of us!,0
Being a fan of BMTH since i was a teenager I was heartbroken when i dident got to see Bring Me The Horizon in Norway last year. And was so happy to see them at Roskilde this summer! This was my first consert i ever went to see alone  and was so lucky to end up in the pit with so much amazing people that was having the same amount of fun as I had. Lots of smiles  tears  high fives and hugs ??,0
In 2011 I was on of the orange vests patrolling camp Area C. At a night shift we were told that the guests weren't allowed to cover their tents in plastic hold to out the rain  it was a fire hazard. There was this one camp filled with men that I had to keep on telling   and every hour I got back   they became more and more annoyed.  The last time before my shift ended they just said  Oh it's the party killer again .  After my shift had ended at 07:00 we were told that the rules had changed.  So I went back to tell the guys.  They were so happy with me   and that I took the time to go tell them that they offered me to sit down for a bear.  I was there for 10 hours  and met the Australian Mark.  And I keep on meeting him randomly at every random morning party I crashed that year.  We still keep in touch and meets up when ever we're both at Roskilde.,0
By complete chance I had a chat with an older man who turned out to be Mogens - One of the two original organisers of Roskilde Festival. Very interesting to hear how it all started.,0
Had a great festival this year and I'm really looking forward to next year. The best and wierdest story from this year was when me and my friends came back to our tent one night. We got to bed  but smelled something different after a few minutes. We realised that someone had been taking a dump in our tent. We had to throw the tent away and sleep outside. That's the rock n roll life right there.,0
This was my first year on Roskilde and I absolutely loved it! I met all these amazing people and I had the best camp on Roskilde  we partied all night and had so much fun together!  I'm definitely going again next year!!! This is not a special story  but it's an overall feeling of the festival which I absolutely adore and love!,0
For me and my friends this was the first time going to Roskilde festival. It was truly amazing! Best story..?  Probably all the amazing comments I got when I was wearing my Lion ?? costume! The best must be the 4 random people that suddenly went to lay flat on their knees and stomach in front of me when I passed by.. I looked at them  totally flabbergasted.. Like what are you doing?! And then I heard one of the guys tell the other persons  Sstt.. It's the Lion king! Behave! ??  Hahaha they earned my respect!   (And it was so great to be welcomed by so many people  even though we are from Holland and can't speak any Scandinavian language. Tak!),0
The rain didn't ruin the party??,0
I can't put words on it - i guess thursday was just one of those days in your life  where nothing goes wrong  no worries  just  smiles  music  happy people and love. That feeling of joy when u're jumping around to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' concert and hoping it never will end. It was first time i was back after Roskilde 2007 - and it made me realize how much i've missed it! #rf16,0
It was my bithday wensday. So we desided to pep it up a little and go all out. It was a great way to meeting new People cuz every  body came up to a talk and a picture.  Thx for another great year.  ??,0
Always celebtating my birthday at Roskilde Festival.. Last year was Pharrell - Happy and this year Tenacious D kickstarted my day with a bang!! I've been to every Roskilde since 1998 except for 2000 and no one wants a repeat of that one  so let's make it 17 years in a row next year without people getting hurt at concerts!,0
To celebrate my 50th birthday and my 34th Roskilde Festival I invited my best friends  -  incl. tickets  a wooden hut on a private Camping ground and a fantastic Festival for 4 days!,0
My Best story is from this years festival. I had decided long ago not to go this year and was fine with the decession. Until the warm-up days began..   I live close to the festivalsite and everyday I could hear and see people going to the festival and the camping site. I felt the orange deling sneaking up on me and suddenly realised that I had to go to the festival this year - but I was late - I was monday the 27...  I reached out to everybody I knew might know someone in need of a volunteer.. But no luck - every place was fully booked.   I reached out to my contact at #gimle and had my fingers crossed. The next day I was offered a volunteer job at the festival working for #gimle! Four hours later I was at the festival thanks to the great people at gimle and the orange feeling. Even though I knew less than a handfull of the people at the festival I went.   Might be the best festival - I went alone  was so openminded  got to meet many new great people  made aweeome new friends and had a blast both on my shifts and in my spare time going to concerts  visiting camps  eating and drinking at the festival and getting the true orange feeling.  #orangefeeling #RF16,0
First year at Roskilde and it was sooo great! I went to see Letlive. and i started chatting with the person next to me. She offered me a beer and told me she was asked by a fotografer to come  so he could get some pictures of her. I never got the chance to say thank you for the beer  so i hope she sees this! Thank you for an amazing pre-concert and Letlive. delivered an outstanding performance that ended my Roskilde experience with manner!,0
This was my First year on Roskilde  i went as a volunteer because i like to help out.  The only Concert i Really needed to see was Tenacious D  and through the days from the First saturday  my shifts was getting  harder and harder and everytring went wrong and all of out computer systems went Down 2-3 times   then it became the Night when Tenacious D had to play and the last shift the Day after was an ease  nothing went wrong and everybody was happy  i am stil flying sky High because of that  One Concert  nothing more this year  have I wanted to do and Then it acctually happend  i still cant believe it. It was a perfect festival! ??,0
My mother was buried less than one week before the festival  so I REALLY needed something to take my mind to a complete other place. Roskilde Festival an good friends surely did that. Simply love the RF..,0
Every year roskilde is doing something special!   Something new and interesting places and stuff to do big up to all the people behind the festival.  This year I worked as a gate security and that was a lot's of fun Og people who were trying to get in with a lot's of random stuff and funny things.  Anyway I had a great time and so did all other people I let in ?.  .  My best story is  What happens at roskilde stays at roskilde ????.   And probably more like the movie hangover in Vegas. So If you haven't seen that one go check it out  I can't say anymore. ????????,0
My name is Andreas and this year was my second time on Roskilde. I love it! This year was full of new experiences. I have always wanted to see a life concert with Red Hot Chillipeppers and this year I did and it was great. I also enjoyed Macklemore and Ryan Lewis who made a huge party for me and my friends. A special thing I will remember from this years festival was that I met a sweet girl from Norway who took me to the Mura Masa concert  just me and her. Literally I just met her a few hours before the concert and we ended up enjoying the concert like if we had known each other for years. The music was great  the food was great and the Roskilde spirit will never die! Thanks for everything! Peace ??,0
Gutted I missed the party of the year had been looking forward to it for since 2015 when I realized that I had an important uni exam during the Roskilde festival this year?? So I have no specials story to from the festival IRL  but thanks to your partnership with red bull and their live stream I got some breaks from the exam reading and glimps of the orange feeling and even had the possibility to watch a couple of concert:) so thank you Roskilde and red bull for making my exam week a bit more cheerful ??,0
They may throw us out of silent and clean  but they may never take our freeeedoooom!!!,0
This year  was my Virgin year at Roskilde  and boy was it a blast! When we first came of the bus  the rain was very heavy  and 3 of us would have to sit at the East entrance for 3 hours  to take Care of all the backs and alcohol and so on  While the rest went in to find the Camp in P. We were around 40 People all in all.   The 3 hours where me and my 2 Buddys were waiting  we began dronning slot beers  because it was so borring just sitting there! So we Got more and more drunk  and we began having a blast at the parkinglot  singing and laughing alot  People looked at us as we were crazy!   Finally the 2 first from the Camp came back  and we could finally get our wristbands. Then we took som bags from the pit bags and alcohol. Then we took our Way to the Camp  which was in settle n share  and when we asked for help  nobody knew where i were  not even the workers at the festival. The bag i was wearing began to get very heavy and it felt like my back would breake! Finally  aften an Hour we found the Camp  far away from everything  it was still raining  and i really wanted to go home.   Then finally at 4 O clock  (we arrived with the bus at 9 O clock in the evening) everybody Got to the Camp and we had a blast  drinking  singing  Dancing and so on.  Roskilde Festival Can be Harsh some times  especially when Its raining alot  but the film Experience is fucking amazing! Its Fun to look back to  and Its Fun in the moment! So ill see you next year  if i win the ticket or not!,0
My Best moment was PJ Harvey??,0
This was my second year  and there is no doubt I will go again next year! :) The community  parties  friends and concerts probably make it the most awesome week of the year. In our camp we had this huge waterfight tuesday  and every swedish / norwegian dude in the area (and there was many <3 ) just joined for an awesome time. That is just one of many great examples of what #RF16 was about. I thank everyone for an exceptionel and awesome week  and I already look forward to next year and the awesome new friends to make. :) I wish you all the best of luck and a great day!,0
This was my 5th year going  but my first as a Volunteer  working as a service guard in November camping area. An experience that taught how vast and dedicated the volunteer-force of Roskilde festival is. So much work and energy is spent  from every single volunteering individual to build and fill out the framework of the festival we all love. Thousands of hours of tremendous work  from thousands of awesome people.  You make Roskilde Festival possible. You breathe life into the festival. So I want to thank you  colleagues and friends alike! Thank you for this #RF16 and I'll see you next year #RF17,0
My friend dropped his iPhone during the Blues Pills concert at Avalon because there was a hole in his pocket. By the time he realised it we had already reached Apollo. He panicked  but I managed to calm him down. We then logged in to find my iPhone on my phone and we managed to track the phone to somewhere around Dixie burger. We then wrote a message on the screen of his phone through the app to call us. 2 minutes later a very kind and sweet girl called Ida (we think) reunited him with his phone. All in less than 15 minutes. All in all a very #RF16 experience!,0
My best story must be sitting on the phone with my boyfriend from England and his friends and talking about how much we want to go next year,0
I followed #tintinpåroskilde on facebook  with their awesome costumes. The rocket had a build-in beerbong!,0
This feeling!,0
After the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert  when the time turned 00:00 it was officially my birthday. To celebrate i dedided to buy myself af mojito at the mojito bus  i was asking for the ginger mojito. But he had to get som more. His co-worker shows up with at Open bottle  drops it on the table  and it sprays all over my clothes  In my eyes and everywere. As i am standing there soaked In ginger ale  everybody is Quick to make sure i am ok  and i got the mojito for free. And that to me is a good examble Of #rf16  everything Can be fucked up In one moment  and the next you laugh and joke about it  and Smell a bit Of ginger ale :)),0
It's still such a whirlwind of memories and emotions that sharing just one anecdote as special almost diminish it. But in the afternoon leading culminating in another legendary Neil Young concert at orange  we made our camp real nice with balloons  flags and all the party supplies one can think of. the norweigan part of our Roskilde-family set up their grogg bar complete with a spinning wheel and all sorts of spirits. And then we welcomed some of our friends with day passes. including old veterans of the camp  my friends parents coming by to celebrate the dads 50th  friendly passes by and whatnot. It's a really shitty anecdote but that afternoon was just perfect in every regard. That is when the Orange Feeling is as alive and kicking in my heart as it can be.,0
My favorite moment(s) were meeting new alot of new people and discovering new music. That is what Roskilde is all about  meeting people  party like crazy with them and go to concerts with them. And I love that feeling when you walk around and go to concerts you did not plan to see and then discover something magical. I did it this year too - in Arena listening to Wiz Kalifa. That is not my music style in any way  but the atmosphere was SO amazing that I got totally blown away ?? #rf16 - you were lovely ?,0
No special story needed just one week of the orange feeling! One week's break from our everyday life  one week of great fun. One week of love!,0
This year was my first at Roskilde Festival. It can be described as no less but fantastic  from the infinite amount of beers I drank with complete strangers  to feeling like one whole organism with around 80.000 other people dancing in front of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Amazing experience  reaching its top when my (according to some  quite hairy) butt was showed on the big screens of Orange Scene.,0
In 2009 I almost didnt go to Roskilde festival but I took to my senses and bought a ticket at the last second. it was one of the best years on Roskilde festival ever. all of my closest friends were there  the best camp ever in the shade of a big tree  and to top it of  I met my husband there that year!,0
I met a new friend! That's what the festival is about.,0
My very best experience was the queue before the opening 2016. It was such good weather and everyone was very happy. I'm so glad we didn't needed a tarpaulin. This was also my first year at Roskilde  but definitely not my last one.,0
One of my best stories starts with dating this guy at Roskilde Festival three years ago. Today we are still a couple who totally loved The Macklemore & Ryan Lewis concert!,0
Roskilde is my first music festival in Europe. Unfortunately  I twisted my ankle and had fracture on my foot on the first day(I jumped too high at Odesza's gig lol)  and I couldn't enjoy the second day because I had to go to the emergency room.  However  I didn't want to miss orange feeling  I could still walk with crutches(had no problem in ankle joint) to Roskilde on the third day and the last day. Everyone including Roskilde fest staffs(especially the one staff in front of the apollo stage gate  I almost got crush on him when he helped me walking with injured ankle and informed me about the first-aid camp lol) and festival goer was so kind to me  they helped me going up and down stairs and praised me I'm cool coming back with broken toe. :p The most impressive part of this festival was  MØ at orange stage it was so beautiful to see every age of people were enjoying the music including grandpas and grandmas with their grandkids. In my country  music fesitval is popular only among young people  it was amzing to see such beautiful crowds. It is so aweful that I couldn't enjoy this festival as fully as I can because of the injury. I will definitely enjoy some next Roskilde festivals and make more friends there. Next time  I will be more careful to enjoy it fully. Still I have made unforgettable memories there  funny thing is - I could see lots of people in Copenhagen still have their wirstband like me and also saw a guy who hurt his leg from Roskilde festival at Bispebjerg Hospital emergency room. Thanks for the memories even it made my itinerary in Europe shorter. ?? I love Roskilde festival.? -from Korea.,0
It was my husbands 25th Roskilde festival in a row. We met there in 2011 and at #rf16 we also celebrated our 5th anniversary as a couple. We will be back next year for sure.,0
Mew in 2012. First time i expirienced Comfording Sounds live - total out of this world moment for 10 amazing minutes!,0
This was my first year ever at Roskilde Festival and I absolutely loved it!  My friends and I made an application for Clean Out Loud and we got in  we were about 30 in our camp and we had a blast every second of the day.  One of the things that surprised me the most was how everyone was so open and kind  it really made you feel a part of something.  I will definitely be back next year (hopefully in COL as well) and winning a ticket would be amazing when you are a working student  Good day,0
This was my first year at Roskilde  and though the concerts were great  I also had a lovely time waiting in line for Maclemore & Ryan Lewis and MØ with my girlfriend. Having patience definitely paid off  because we got to experience those concerts up close.,0
Well  this year me and My friend were standing in the queue for the fence to fall. In the middle of this warzone we got hushed away from two perfect spots for us! We kept running and felt like this is not going as planned  running from south entrence to the g-spot  ) there we were standing and in the middle of a sentence someone knocked me on the shoulder and said HEY DANIEL! And there stands my camp that i lived with in 2014  Trønderfari ??  And after that we had a wonderful festival week with the Trønds! Thanks for that Roskilde ??,0
At this years Roskilde festival i had fun.,0
This year i Went With a friend Josefine Nielsine Hermansen But ended up With tons of new friends.. At Roskilde we are all One Big family - no matter the race  religion or sex - just One Big happy family ????,0
Sat at home and cried while watching the RHCP concert on my laptop :)),0
This year  I saw a man magically turn an empty beer can into a full one in front of my eyes. I saw Kyle Gass commit suicide  only to rise from the dead. I spent new years eve 6-10 times ( I can't remember the exact number of times due to getting very drunk from the first new years celebration ) I was wet many times  but my tent stayed dry. I met a friend whom I hadn't seen in 10 years. I saw many pokémons but I couldn't catch them all.. I was at Tim Christensens (Dizzy Mizz Lissy) birthday-party. I heard the  song  Nede Mette 87 times  and not a single one of those times from my own camp. I became a Knight and a Star man  and I had 7 drunken nights. Also it was my 10th year at Roskilde Festival.,0
Arrive ?? Drink ?? Party ?? Listen to Music ?? Have fun ?? Win ?? Ready for next year ????,0
The first night  I drank a beer bong made from a stuffed Fox in a strangers Camp #firsttimeonRoskilde ?? #profilepicisevidence #RF16,0
To be a part of the life in and around Partylöwen Camp on Caravan Camping is the best experience for me  year after year.. B-),0
Driving around in a cart for four hours. Visiting different camps  by letting the people I meet choose the next spot on my way. Every person I met was sweet and pulled me to the next camp. After four hours I was placed back in my own camp  and ended the trip with a game of beer bowling,0
I walked past a 3 charging Station at like 6 in the morning and a Guy who to be honest mostly reminded me of hercules where filling his empty Smirnoff 3/5(not sure about the size i didnt Ask  i kinda wanted to live) litre with soda  smashing it into the Ground yelling  IM DETROYING THR GRASS   I've honestly never been so aftaid of a single person  i think i deserve 5 tickets for this horrendous experience.,0
Sitting in the sun enjoying Lightwaves Impire waiting for coffee  a young  swedish man suddenly threw himself in the chair beside me  gave me (a woman at 60) a big hug og babbled on that this was his first Roskilde Festival  and how much he loved it  how f..... fantastic it was and that he absolutely will return next year. Gave me another hug and disappeared. That's what it's all about  isn't it? Love to the music and one another - even though you dont know them. That young swede made my day (if it wasn't made already) :-),0
Participating in the naked run. One of the most euphoric things i've ever done!,0
This year was my first year at Roskilde. And it was unbelievable! It was like this perfect world where everyone were one big family. The best and most intimate moment of this years festival was when a friend and I were sitting  very tired  in the entrance to Gloria on a piece of wood  with a pillow underneath and my jacket over us. Random people stopped to take pictures of us and talk to us because we looked cute and one guy even told us that this was the very essence of Roskilde Festival. I enjoyed sitting there in the corner with my friends head on my shoulder and a smile on my face.,0
This year  for my 2nd year of Roskilde Festival  I worked as a volunteer at The Ranch. At The Ranch I experienced an amazing community. We volunteers had access to a lounge  where we could buy a cold beer and some food. Every day at noon some of the volunteers made us Danish  smørrebrød   and the lounge was a great place to gather  and meet wonderful new people - besides  it was a great break from dust and mud. Volunteering at The Ranch was my best #RF16 experience  and I am definitely going to be a volunteer there again!,0
Best memory is when we got back early morning and couldn't get in to our caravan due to some damage on the lock. So we had to wake up one of our friends so she could climb on top of the caravan  unscrew the window up there  and then in best Mission Impossible-style climb down from the roof in to the caravan to open the door from the inside. It was so much fun at the momonet even thou it started of in a bad way with us not being able to get in to out own caravan. Thank you for the help Josefin,0
My best #RF16 story is when I heard Neil Young and The Promise of The Real for 3 hours with my girlfriend and her family. Afterwards we went to Tame Impala for the last bit of their concert. It was two mind blowing concerts!,0
Finally  after 11th year in a row  my time to enter the Arena stage came. Thank you for bringing back Santo-Santigold  ) Dancing in the stage light!,0
One of My Best moments at #RF16 was when I stood No More than 10-15m from the Red Hot Chili Peppers! It was amazing as a fan to finally see Them on the stage right in front of me!  Not to mention all the amazing people I met at RF16! I still have contact with some of Them!   Roskilde  you make Dreams Come true!,0
I made a deal with a friend about she would go to BRING ME THE HORIZON concert with me. She would normally never listen to metal or music like that at all. But it is a big part of my life  so she have been hear a lot about it  and about the great Bring me the horizon concert in Vega. So she went with me to the show at Arena. And she had a great time. Go to watch what a real mosh pit is  but still also sing a lot and jumping around. So in general it gave her a bigger understanding of the music I love  and we had a great time.  That is one of the thin that is so magic about Roskilde. Being able to show ppl music they normal never hear but at Roskilde it can happen. So what that #RF16 moment did was help me show her the music I love  and her understand why I love it. In the real world it is awesome and in the world of Roskilde it where an Orange feeling moment where we connect at one point more :-),0
Oh  there are so many! All the music experiences and the beer bowling and the  just sitting in a chair because that's all you have to do today  - I don't think I can mention any bad experiences. Some of the best music experiences  that I can think of right now  are Dizzy Mizz Lizzy in 2010  Kings of Leon  Of Monsters And Men  and Major Lazer. But also the parties in West and Dream City and running through the camping area at that perfect time where the sun is starting to rise are among my favourites!,0
The feeling you get when you spend 10 days with these guys:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/204275419598236/permalink/1437959092896523/,0
This year was my 8th year at Roskilde festival. I was 15 the first time my parents draged me with them. I i have been in love with Roskilde ever since ? my best moment  at #rf16 was when my friend Bjarke lifted me up during MØ's koncert. Im not very tall  so i never really  get to see how the crowed looks like when they are jumping and dancing around ?? and it looked amazing ???? a view i will never forget ??,0
Rf16 was my first year and i loved it to the bones.  It's really hard to pick the best moment cause there was so many of them.!  One of The Best parts was the sleep concert  me and 4 of my friends bought our tickets mostly to see them  we sat in line one and a half hour to get up front and it was one of the best concerts we had seen in our life's. The crowd safety was so friendly and in a good mood  and when the concert was over we got the setlists and drumsticks from the one of the sweet guys from crowd safety to take home with us  we where so high on that concert that no words could explain it. And there was so many more fantastic moments  the Tenacious D concert where I went alone but was taken good care of some guys  they let me up to the last fence and made the waiting time not so long  it was an old dream that came true seeing them  sadly I had to go to get up front to the ghost concert that also was wonderful.!  There was 10 dream concerts I got fulfilled and saw some new bands that made me go home and go trough a lot of their music and I saw some of my friends over there I haven't seen for over two years.  I got so many fantastic memory's with me home from RF16 and I'm defiantly going again next year !,0
I captured this moment of my friends. And all I can do is laugh.  One of my favorite moments - in my life - I think.  A everyday moment like this happens all over Roskilde. But the special thing was that I noticed the magic - everyday Roskilde magic. #RF16,0
The koncert with Mac Demarco this year. I have been a big fan of him for a long time  and when i saw that he was going to perform at Roskilde  i had to be there. I got in the frontrow  and the koncert was magical from the start - he fulfilled all my expectations  and he finished the concert with some epic crowdsurfing.,0
Had a great festival this year and I'm really looking forward to next year. The best and wierdest story from this year was when me and my friends came back to our tent one night. We got to bed  but smelled something different after a few minutes. We realised that someone had been taking a dump in our tent. We had to throw the tent away and sleep outside. That's the rock n roll life right there.,0
I actually didn't go this year. Couldn't get off of work. But my friends that went had a group chat on facebook  which I followed. So there were a lot of strange interactions the more drunk they got. So it was kind of like being there even though I was at home with my little daughter. I did watch several live concerts on Redbull TV. The worst being RHCP and Best being Macklemore...,0
Me and my brother are both born and raised in Roskilde and have gone to the festival for many years  but this year he won the dancebattle 2016!  With a crew consisting of him  and two guys he didnt even know. So i feel like he really deserves a festival ticket for next year and I would (of course) love to go with him ??

We ate grass and baby wipes #istawin #rf16,0
My dad went to some of the first Roskilde festivals back in the days and my parents now going on 34 years love story started during a Santana concert at Roskilde in 80'. He came to visit Roskilde this year on a one-day ticket. We had the most amazing time playing beer bowling in our camp  Camp Bodega. We sang and danced like crazy to Red Hot Chili Peppers and afterwards he out-partied almost every single one of the camp members back in the Bodega.  That was such amazing experience to share with my old super hippie of a dad.,0
So  I was in the que to see Tenacious D this year (I'm a huuuge fan of the greatest band in the world) and we came to the que about 4 hours early. We had a nice spot about 60-100 people infront of us  we sat down and had a beer from the conveniently close by beer tent on the left side of the Orange stage :) (you gotta fill up before a band that great!). After we've had a few  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis goes on stage and some of us stand up  for another great concert even from the sidelines btw!  After the concert people start to sit down again (about 1.5 hour before The D goes on) but as people start to rush out from the now finished Macklemore concert they start  jumping in que  infront of us  this makes a few people in the que stand up and some of us start telling people to not jump in  problem is that not everyone is as experienced at telling people to not be Jack-ass'es and after a few minutes about 200-300 people are infront of us in the que.. I lose it abit  or maybe alot  nonetheless I start yelling out to all the people infront of us  that all those who came in late should feel like idiots and btw f*** off.. Not a great moment for me. As I'm  preaching  at everyone a guy just in front of me says:  calm down  have a smoke  and he hands me a cigarette  normally I don't smoke  but in the heat of the moment I go:  sure  .. After that I calm down  but the guy and his friend cheer at me  and even goes and get's me another beer.. After a while I sense that i knew the good samaritan  not sure from where  so I go:  where you guys from?  the one who handed me the smoke goes:  we're from Esbjerg!  And there it strikes me  he looks an aweful lot like my cousin and her husbond  so I go:  are you Benjamin?   he answers very surpricingly:  yes!? How did you know?  -  cuz I'm Jakob  your mother's cousin!!!  We haven't seen eachother for about 8 years so none of us could recognize each other - we went in to the concert together and had a blast! #anythingcanhappenatroskilde #truestoryfromrf16 #rf16,0
I watched the live stream from home ?? and decided I have to go next year.. will be my 12th time  after a break of 4 yrs. Would love to see how it's developed since my first trip in 96 ??,0
Our neighbourcamp played this song from Nero every single day  Promises it was called. In stead of yelling  Promises   they turned it into  Parmesan   and we all had a blast about it every single day. One day I met some of the guys by coincidence  and they tell me they just found out that Nero was playing the final show at Roskilde. We talked about how much fun it would be to stay for that  and just yell PARMESAN with all we got left. I've never made it to the final show at Roskilde  and never stayed for the  hell night   but since we lived in silent&clean  I felt this was the time. So saturday after LCD Soundsystem  we went to the Spaghetti stand  and I bought 25 bags of parmesan for the show. We went to see Nero  and when Promises started we all went nuts  throwing parmesan all over the place  and of course yelling PARMESAN! That might be the greatest way to end an entire week of fun and madness. Roskilde I love you  and I'll be back for round ten next year  free tickets or not ???,0
Best moment from #rf16 was Ghost. I discovered them 4 years ago also at RF  so it was great to see them again.,0
Born and raised in Roskilde  this was my 7th Year attending the festival. My girlfriend had never once been there  and so this was her first time being in the thick of it with the rest of us. She had her musical horizon widened so much  and my favourite memory from #RF16  was shouting along with her to Tenacious D - and later on headbanging like animals to Ghost at Arena - both her first rock concert and her first headbanging experience and she loved it! Best festival memory since the Prodigy Concert in '10!,0
This year was not my first time at Roskilde Festival  even though it felt like that. The last couple of years I've spent my time there with my parents and some of their friends  but this year I went by myself. Many of my friends were there  so I spent some of the time with them  but I didn't go with anyone specific. At first that scared me  but then I realised that even though you are not with your closest friends  you are surrounded by people  who are there for the same reason as you - to listen to music and have a great time. So even though I spent time alone  I never felt alone :)) It was a great festival this year!,0
Our camp has through the years stayed in the middle of C  and every year we have taken a group shot on the road just outside our camp. Normally we just ask a neighbour or someone passing by to take a picture of us and then move on. But this time  back in year 2012  I dont know why but the person taking the picture couldnt get it right so it took a couple of minutes before she got the camera going. By then about the amount of people posing had more than doubled and we have these amazing pictures with a random group of people on shot! Today I have many of them as friends on facebook and we usually meet every year since we always camp in the same area.   We take a new photo like this every year but havent been able to grab that communal feeling of 2012 yet. We have a dream that some time in the future stand there posing for a long while and see how many people randomely join in. Maybe we will be able to connect and share a beautiful moment with hundreds of people :),0
Me and my friend spent around about 500 hours in total planning  building and wiring our speaker. Likewise a lot of money. Every year the orange feeling spreads through our bones  but this year  we felt like we contributed to it. Every evening we enjoyed the sight of up to 100!people dancing in the moonlight whilst being flushed with Orange feeling. #RF16 was my best year so far - The honour of giving  is the best I could get.  The story: We unloaded our speaker off of a trailer and moved it into the waiting area the day before opening day. The following day in the morning  whilst listening to music  one of our tires exploded. After panicking a bit  I contacted my dad  who drove 60 km to give us a new wheel. About an hour after his arrival  we switched the wheel out with a fresh one. All good. Half an our later  lines opened and people rushed to find a good spot on the camping site. After setting up our tents  we went to move the speaker to our spot. When we got to East city  another tire went. For 1 1/2 hour  our speaker was just standing in the middle of East City - At this point  I had had 10 hours of sleep during the last 72 hours. After clearing my mind  we removed 450 kg of batteries from the wagon  and borrowed a wheel from a fellow unknown festival contestant. We got the wheel on - Moved the speaker to our spot. Went back with the wheel to my new friend and from then  the speaker stood on axle stands. I installed the batteries again  and the speaker played almost 24/7 from then on. During the week we lost a third wheel  but changed both broken wheels to a thicker wheel type before having to move the speaker back home.  Pain in the ass - But worth every hour! Thanks Roskilde - for the opportunity!,0
Definitely L.O.C. in 2011 - never been so high on life! He is the King and always will be! I'm sure he noticed me in the massive crowd! Hope to see him on Roskilde again very soon!,0
Driving by on sunday - finally ends the torture of not being on #rf16 and the nice livestreamings on fb...,0
Some of my friends we're going to see some psychedelic rock (Klub 27) and it was already pretty weird as one of our friends thought he was flying around with his new friend Per Pind who was a piece wood.  Rasmus Litske Mogensen Laurits Bundgaard Nielsen,0
The Best story I can think of from this year happened the day Red Hot chili peppers played. Me and my friend spent the whole day walking around the campsite. We visited the Samaritans because of a knee injury. We went to 5 concerts before rhcp so we didn't really had time to drink or eat. At the rhcp concert we both felt a little dizzy  but we didn't want to go because we had a really good place close to the last pit but with no people smashed up to us. And then this guy asks us if we would like to have 2 of his ICE COLD BEERS ! I'm a really big fan of rhcp so this made my day! Me and my friend could enjoy some ice cold beer and hear my favorite band. It made me forget about my knee injury and we had a blast to  the adventures of rain dance Maggie  thank you so much for the beers to the nice guy!,0
I didn't go and regret my decision immensely. #RF16,0
Best moment was watching PJ Harvey giving the best show at Arena! Would love to experience something like that again in 2017 ??,0
My best festival experience was probably when my best friend  Mathias  and I were supposed to hear Biffy Clyro together  however unlucky as he was  he was given shifts at his volunteer job while they were playing. So there I was standing at the concert when suddenly my friend showed up for our favorite song (Many of Horror  of course) Apparently his boss gave him permission to listen to 5 mins of the band playing. So we sang along for the song wherafter he had to run back to his shift again.  That summed up the best of my festival  even though the Ghost concert was pretty damn mindblowing amazing as well.,0
I think it was in 2014. This is the only year out of 9 years at the festival that I woke up one day and had to ask what time and day it was. It was Thursday.... I don't remember the actual story from the 4 days at the warm up days that year  because beer  but I'm sure it was the greatest! XD,0
Celebrating Music for 8 days with a Camp of 3 different generations ranging from 25 over 37 to 63. Showing the  old  guys new music like Blaue Blume. Listening to their stories how they celebrated Neil Young or New Order at our age back then. And in the end standing in front of Arena or Orange listening to and seeing what is connecting us all. Music  without borders  without ages  from all countries all over the world. Best time EVER.,0
Just got off my shift as a volenteer with my best friend and it was time to get our drink on. We met up with my friend chris and had a glitterfight   made glitterbeards  legs  hair... and then went to party in dreamcity. Chris went home and we went back to our camp (all sleeping). When suddenly tenacious D starts playing and i end out in an epic duet with a guy who knows our camp next door. Suddenly everyone from the next door camp is back and the morning party is on. We end up deciding to go skinny dipping in the lake that morning. Gotta love the Roskilde feeling ?,0
I´ve been at Roskilde since 2007  except for year 2013 and 2015. Roskilde Festival 16´ was going to be my big come back! I was quiet nervous about coming back  because I didn´t have the best year at Roskilde in 2014. Some shit happened in 2014 which was a big turn off for me  and then I skipped the festival in 2015. I was totally sure that I would never come back to Roskilde again. But I took the chance and bought a ticket  and today it´s something I never regret I did! Lots of spontaneous and crazy funny things happened on my first day at RF16: I became friends with four big random guys  who screamed  tigermis  at me  because I accidently got involved in their beergame  and suddenly these four guys with big muscles was over me  and I was just a little one lying under them on the ground! What else  somebody did through a dildo in my face  while I was doing a limbo dance in one of my friends camps in West! I still can´t remember where it came from  but I just through it back where I thought it came from! After the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert  I saw a woman crying. I didn´t say that much to her  but I just went straight to her and gave her a big hug. She hug me back and was crying out in my arms. I didn´t know who she was  but it definitely helped her to get back on track to have a great festival! The next day I went to Dream City for party! I went straight into a crowd of people  dancing alone  and suddenly I was dancing with a nice young beautiful woman. 30 seconds after  we kissed  and 1 minute later  we went to my tent  and then you can guess the rest of the story!  ) I´ve been at Roskilde many years  but never really had the Orange feeling before this year  where I definietly experienced everything  you exactly want to happen a Roskilde! 8D See you next year! <3,0
One of the most unforgetable moments to me must be my first day at roskilde in 2015 (the first year i went) me and some friends had been drinking since we came  and we decided to go to camp C to party. After some time we decided to go to camp G. When we got there one of mye friends wanted to go home so he went back to the camp (we lived at J camp). After a while i decided that i wanted to go home myself. I told my friend and he wanted to party some more  so i went alone with my jack daniels bottle. Now  keep in mind that this was the first time going to Roskilde and i had no geographical memory of where J were + i was drunk. I think the time was arround 02:00 when i was heading back  and when i got to where i thought J camp were i could not find my tent. It ended up in me going back and forth for 1 hour  then decided to go some other place to look incase i was in the wrong camp. After some time i feel asleep on a small wooden cheese  until some party people woke me up and started to dance with me. By some magical miracle i got to my tent when the clock was 5am or 6am. And i woke up in the morning without the jack daniels bottle  and all of my friends wondering where i had been.  This is something i never can forget and to me it is such a funny memory to have.,0

I broke my ribs in 08 I think  in the moshpit at the John Dillinger escape plan.. Passed out several times from the pain and was carried out. My camp mates build me armor from camping gear and duct tape and the following day I was at the anti flag show (whom I couldn't leave without seeing) and they  of course  had to pull a wall of death! It hurt like all hell  but it was all worth it!! Not an rf16 moment but still!...  This year I think top was Elle King! She looked very hung over  playing at 12 noon on Friday! However the always awesome roskilde audience went all in  and cheered miss King to the top of her game in just a couple of songs!... Rare you see a young one-hit artist where said one hit is not the song that harvests the biggest applause! Audience really made a difference that day and definitely 6/6 show!,0
This year was my fifth year on the festival and my fifth year of volunteering as well. I work as a guide down at the train station  trinbrættet  and one day this elderly man came up to my sister and I and gave us both a big hug. We talked to him until the train arrived and he told us that he had been a Roskilde festival guest sins the very beginning of the festival in 1971 and been a volunteer sins 82'. He told us how much the festival meant to him and how he was grateful to still be coming there at the age of 75.  That day he gave us some words to live by. He said:  you only get one life and you'll  never get a the chance of a do-over. You don't know how long or short it will be or when the clock stops ticking. So remember to live while you can  so you don't look back on your life with regret. And remember to be happy about the life you've been given so that when you're my age  can look back on a lifetime of good memories.   From that moment on I decided to live by those words and to do what makes me happy  to have fun  and to make sure that the people in my life  will always know how happy and lucky I am to share my life with them  so that I  when my time comes  will look back on my life with a smile on my face.,0
My best friend Kathrine and I had both agreed that the moment where James Blake sings  Suddenly I'm Hit   in his song retrograde  is the biggest redemption of ecstasy in any music number we've ever heard.  So we were very much looking for to his convert at Arena. Unfortunately Kathrine had spent a couple of hours dancing while on her knees a few days before   so she could not stand on her legs   and had to be seated on the ground in the middle of the crowd throughout the concert. When James Blake started humming  Retrograde   I joined her  and when  he sung  Suddenly I'm Hit  I didnt only experience one of the greatest moments in a song. I experienced on of my greatest moments of #rf16 with my best friend   on the ground  in the middle of some of my favorite people: The Roskilde Crowd.,0
My favorite moment at this year's Roskilde was at the Slayer concert. I loved to see the diversity of the people there. I saw moshpitting young dudes at the pit. I saw little babies with earmuffs rocking on their proud dads arms. I even saw elder men with leather jackets  earplugs and walkers (rollator) in the back of the crowd. Maybe an age different of 70 years between youngest and oldest. But everyone there together having the best time. And this is exactly what Roskilde and the orange feeling is about to me,0
My best moment at the festival  was when I got Roskilde married to my girlfriend at camp nasty's church. It was Saturday the 2nd. and exactly 1 year after we met etch other at Roskilde festival 2015.,0
My best story from this year's festival happened Thursday night during the absolutely amazing Macklemore & Ryan Lewis concert. My friend Laura and I sat in line for some hours so we got a great spot in the pit. We had been talking about this concert for months and just looking forward to being there together. While performing Can't Hold Us  Macklemore decided to pay a little visit to the fans in the front pit. He went out over us and we held him up while he partied with us. At one point he was right above me and I was holding him up with both my hands. That moment was the most insane one I had at RF16. After the concert we rushed to see CHVRCHES  which was a great concert  with so much energy from the band. When we went back to Orange to meet up with some other friends we were both emotionally and physically drained of energy. It had been such a crazy night. To calm ourselves down we decided to buy ten shots and the biggest drink the bar could offer. We sat down to listen to Tenacious D and met some girls from Spain. They had traveled all the way from Madrid to experience the orange feeling. They were so friendly and we instantly had a great conversation about how unique Roskilde Festival is when it comes to bringing people together across nations  religions and cultures. All that matters at Roskilde is that you have a love of music and that you like to have fun. Meeting these girls was for me a perfect picture of the orange feeling. At this point the shots were starting to do their magic and we went back to the camp and partied until dawn. It was truly an amazing night and I feel lucky that I got to experience it right next to one of my best friends in the world. I can't wait to make more Roskilde memories with her next year! And carrying Macklemore - come on - that is a once in a lifetime experience.,0
I got on stage with Santigold when she invited members of the audience to dance with her!,0
Roskilde will always be special to me  since it was the first festival I went to together with my younger brother. We have different taste in music and never went to the same festivals. But then in 2013 this amazing place brought together some of our favorite bands  that we both enjoyed watching. It would be great to share another 4 days with him at Roskilde next year! Love you Sebastian.,0
Sadly I couldn't attend this year. Roskilde 2015 I had an amazing time I went with only one friend without a campsite and we were basically adopted by all the surrounding campsites. Drinking telling stories and making great friendships that are still going on today. I'd love for an opportunity to go again.,0
Last year  my friend had been trying to annoy me during the waiting area. I vowed to get revenge on him  this year. We were over with our sister camp  a few blocks away and it was raining quite heavily so the water was building up on the edges of the canopy. I walked behind my friend and tapped him on the shoulder to give a handshake. When he gave me his hand  I pulled him backwards  off his seat so that he was lying on the ground and pushed the water from the canopy all over him! He was annoyed for a moment but saw the funny side of it.  I'll have to watch my back   next year...  ),0
Hearing Heart of Gold live. That might be the best memory of my life.,0
This was my seventh year in a row at Roskilde Festival and it was amazing?? The music  the atmosphere  and the people working for Roskilde: assuring all us drunk people had a swell time - safely. ?? They have always been awesome all the years I've been at the festival  but this year a kind crowd safety worker made our concert just that extra notch better so we could really feel the orange feeling - (it's the guy on the left) - long story short: amongst chaos he kept calm and made sure we all had an awesome time. Thank you crowd safety! ??,0
The Best moment music moment at #RF16 was when macklemore said  DAHM  3 times after just enterting orange stage  and when the crowd went crazy doing the rest of the show.. amazing concert!!!,0
Best memory from rf must have been last year at the suspekt concert. My whole Camp went there (we are about 18 guys) and it was the first concert we went to togehter in the 3 years we have been a camp. To experince such a good concert with the Best friends really made the orange feeling come alive. May be the Best concert and moment in my life ??????,0
My best #RF16  moment was when I witnessed my girlfriend  reach the final in a dance battle/competition held in Dream City. It was the first time I saw her dance  for real  and I felt so proud when the crowd cheered her name.,0
I don´t have any (yet) :P,0
I was speakin english almost the whole 8 days of this year  so when I said 'Godmorgen' to my neighbor camp the last day  they were  I think  a little embarrassed for the nice things some of the girls had said about me in danish. I had a laugh :) I would love to take 4 of my Happy Tree campers with me next year @ #RF17 - And thank you for an amazing year! #RF16,0
My best #rf16 story must be about going to two concerts that I had not planned which also was some of the best this year. Bring me the horizon and house of pain. But stil the best festival was 1997 were I meet a lovely girl who I now have been married to for 16 years  and have 2 kids with.,0

After a really bad experience at the 2012 festival  where some guys  had a really bad and sexist attitude towards me  I haven't returned to Roskilde. I felt that it was the guys were allowed to behave at the festival  and it made me feel unsafe. This year with the focus on equality I decided I would get back to the festival  take up the fight and act the way I always had  since I went to my first festival at the age of 18 in 2009. I decided that I would see some concerts alone like I used to  and I was frightened and proud the first time I went around the camping area by myself. On the last day I had decided to go to Immortal Technique by myself - He played at 00 at Avalon on Saturday night. I love hiphop  but none of my friends wanted to go  and I just wouldn't miss it. In the last song  Dance with the devil  which everyone in the crowd had waited for  Immortal technique ends my festival experience with such a great statement: Something bad might have happened to your mom  sister or girlfriend  and that you should respect women  because they are proud creatures  who rather hold their head up high than admit something bad had happened to them  and I left Roskilde with a very touched soul. Thanks #RF16  because you chose to focus on the fact  that even at Roskilde Festival there are boundaries for what you might say and do - I know it has always been the politic  but none the matter it did not feel like that in 2012. Thanks for letting me be able to experience the festival with friends and by myself without the fear  that something bad might happen. And thank you to Immortal Technique  such a big idol to especially young guys  for making such a great statement that might touch something in someone  and prevent sexist words or action from happening in the future <3,0
Me  my boy and our friends  Went to Roskilde festival and slept in tents A week full with music  fun and beer  It's the absolute highlight of the year Remembering singing along to  final song  And realizing that a ticket to Roskilde festival will never do wrong #RF16,0
To be a part of this year amish camp is the most incredible experience.  The feeling of love  and how we All took care of each other and wanted too give and help everybody. This is how the world really should be.,0
The wife and I was standing near the soundtent before and during Dizzy Mizz Lizzy  and as such had a clear view over the pit and half the ramp for the handicapped. I noticed this girl sitting in a wheelchair. A couple of guys in the pit came over and spoke with her and after a brief conversation gave her the rest of their bucket of popcorns before finding a nice spot to stand. She got so happy and excited she nearly jumped out of her wheelchair.  Such a small gesture seemed to do a great impact on this girl and her mood. I believe for just a moment  she felt like part of 'their' world  and they were part of hers.  Or perhaps she just really likes popcorn ??,0
One of my craziest nights on Roskilde I was partying in West with a friend of mine. We had this idea that it would be awesome if we could do a  flikflak  - however we couldn't. Not even after endless tries. Then we got the idea to just  fake it till you make it . So we had some people help  turning us upside down . Before we knew it we were the ones challenging people to do a  flikflak . Most people said no  but once they saw what we did they found it funny. The same night we met some guys who could castigate a bottle of bobbles with anything you can imagine (even with a festival chair!!). So after a lot of bobbles and castigating we thought - why not combine the two newfound hobbies of ours? So they castigated a bottle and then hurried to turn me upside down in our fake flikflak and turned me the torn bottle. Of cause this only ends stupid with me having my lip slit and a lot of blood running down my face. But I didn't feel a thing cause I had that orange feeling.,0
My best moment was covering up a girl I didn't know  who decided to take a shit next to a tree between orange and arena!!!,0
2017 will be my fifth year at Roskilde Festival. My first year was in 2013 when i was a newborn 17 year old  and I'm not a second of doubt that there will not be a single year  which I do not participate in. I have so many good memories from these 4 years at the festival  that I could use as my  best story  i just can't choose. Roskilde has helped me through hard times  strengthened my joy  and not least  it has become the week I look the most forward to every year. Roskilde has made me laugh and cry  most of all of pure joy. You have given me the opportunity to have experienced my greatest music idol - James Blake  TWICE(!) and made me cry of joy both times. However  one of the largest things I have participated in at Roskilde Festival  must be MØ's debut at the Pavillion Jr. in 2013. Crammed of people  moshpits  lack of oxygen - but a whole lot of pleasure. After which I had the honor of seeing her grow from Arena and this year  Orange Stage - all because you guys gave me the opportunity. Thank you so much <3,0
Immortal Technique showing up last minute on Avalon and killing it with his lyrics and message,0
When i asked my friend leo what he'd give me if I...  500!   he snapped without knowing what I was gonna propose. So  before he could change his mind  I stripped naked and streaked the skate park  hugging people and posing in photos. Leo gladly paid and we still laugh about this today.,0
Had an amacing festival again this year  what made it special was that my old camp was reunited. We were a camp from 2008-2014 then didn't live together last year and now reunited it is a great way to keep seeing the high school group ??,0
I didn't go ??,0
The first time I came to Roskilde I came alone by train. In the queue someone started talking to me and we talked until we had gotten our wristbands then we went our separate ways. I started walking towards my campingspot were my boyfriends friends were supposed to meet me. On the way there I got thirsty and wanted to buy a cider but I could've only buy 24 and I was to tired to carry it all. Then a guy came up to me and offers me a beer. I Said thank you but no thank you because I Don't drink beer. Then he said sorry sorry sorry because he couldnt give me something. That first day gave me the true meaning of the Orange feeling and it was amazing! ????,0
This was my second year at the Festival  and I loved it even more than last year  if that's possible. Last year we were a big camp of 19 people  and this year I was just going with 2 friends. It was fine  but I wanted a lot of people and a huge camp. On the bus on the way down  we met some acquaintances of ours  and started talking away. Now our little group of 3 had expanded to 7  and I was starting to feel good about a camp. About an hour later  I start talking with some more people sitting right by us  expanding our camp to 11 people. I'm thinking it's taking shape now  and feeling pretty good. So I relax for the rest of the ride  and finally set up camp about 8.  When we've just bought our first beers  some Swedish guys are putting up their tent next to our camp  and before we knew it  we're 14  and ended up being 20 people.  20 of some of the most amazing people I've ever met  made this festival one of the greatest  must unforgettable experiences so far in my life.  I especially want to thank the Swedish guys for some amazing mixtapes and music. They brought a boomblaster and CD's  and had the greatest homemade mixtapes I've ever heard.  I can't wait for next year already! #CampHoldTheFlap16 #CampFlexyAsAFridge17,0

This year I went to roskilde half handicapped with a walking stick  wondering how I would survive the walk from P every day. Like my Friends I'm a huge fan of Tame impala and when they played all my friends were going in pit but for good reasons I wasn't able to  so there I was sitting in a festival chair in the handicap pit without any friends  Haha. Even tho I couldn't even see them play I really enjoyed the concert and afterwards I randomly ended up at the James Blake concert almost by my self again. Normally I don't listen to James Blake but the music and time at night was just perfect! Status: currently own 2 roskilde wristbands and heavily counting on getting my third next year!,0
Mø says it all!! - staying in pit with my best mate and the friends around us! And having the best party we could ever have to end a wonderful festival! #thanksRoskilde,0
I went last year on a one-day trip. It was a present for my 18th birthday that we were going to Roskilde Festival to watch Kendrick Lamar whom I truly admire. Obviously  we also saw a lot of other musicians  e.g. DJ Mustard and Disclosure plus more. The Kendrick-concert was so insane and fantastic and that day was definitely the best day of my life  100%! :),0
There have been so many good experiences! Its had to choose... but one stands out! It a few years ago and i where in a camp withvfriends from kolding. One day the sky opened and rain was pouring down. We found shelter under an agora in the festival area. It was really cosy but very warm with all the people crowded together in the hot rain. When the rain stopped and we went back to camp we found that our camp mates had dock a river staight across the camp diagonal under our only pavillion! All of us where falling in all the time. But on the last day when everyone where leaving after the last concert we found a lot of shoes to fill out the hole! We ended up finding a lot of other awesome stuff and made the best camp ever with a carpet of punktured air matresses and we found a white fence to put around our camp. We also found a closet of fabric from ikea that was turned into a bar cabinet with beer and alcohol given to us by people leving. It was the best experience ever!,0
Sitting on the camping listening to the Island-England match on our stereo with people poping in from Norway  Sweden and Denmark for some Nordic football solidarity.,0
One of my best #rf16 moments must be from the James Blake concert. It was Friday and I was tired (!) and  all I wanted was my nice and warm sleeping bag. But my friends and I ended up at James Blake anyway. We just sat there in the back of Arena with a great view over the crowd  peacefully - not speaking to anyone  just lisning. Suddenly the rain started to pour and together with Blakes voice and the music it created a kind of magical moment. I didn't know James Blake before but stayed the whole concert (despite the rain and the calls from my sleeping bag) because I was so enchanted. A very unexpected experience - Roskilde festival in a nutschield  ) ?,0
At my 2. Time at Roskilde my friends and I met some great new people lying just next to us. They were from another part of Denmark (jylland) and lots of fun  playful dissing and hate was exchanged. We made it into a sport and almost every night we played beer-bowling and got very drunk while playing  copenhagen vs jylland  one night I had a little too much and fell asleep in a camping chair. The guys from jylland worked together with my friend and duck taped me to a chair. They then proceeded to wrap toiletpaper around and tape beer to me. The most impressive thing is though that they somehow managed to stack 5 beer cans and a can of corn on top of my head. *cheers* to memories like these! Thanks for a great #RF16 this year!,0
My Best RF story is i never have been there so Pick!,0
I wasn't going this year because of work  and not having the time. Then a bandmate of a friend of mine died. I've never met him myself  but the guy was a big inspiration to a lot of people  making a difference in many peoples lives. His death made me remember how fragile we are and how fast it can all be over. That moment I knew I had to get to my favorite place in the world  and the next morning I arrived at Roskilde Festival. As always I had a blast  enjoying my  just being at the festival  even more than usually. There are a few special people who have the ability to move you even after they go away. He was one of those people. Thanks for the festival  Peter!,0
#RF16 I went one a oneday ticket  just to see/hear/feel PJ at Arena! Just amazing... We were three mothers on our forstå evening away from home.. So we sat togethers afterwards  with our breastpumps  and pumped and talked about the amazing show.. So happy for that experience ????,0
My story is my tent got raided and our neighbors found out and gave us some new jackets and beer.,0
It was at my first year. A friend of mine and I were having a blast at one of the warmup days. Sometime in our drunkenness we decide to throw a rope around my neck as a collar and 'walk me'. We stumbled upon various camps who found this funny  and paid us in beers to walk me(some treated me better than others  a polish girl almost strangled me  but it was still funny). In the end we get into this camp with a single girl and a ton of guys  and we kindly ask them whether they wanna trade a walk for a beer. The girl grabs a couple of beers and agrees while my buddy stays in their camp for a drink. She walked me with the robe and and I had a really good time. So when we came back I asked for her phonenumber. She went into the tent after a blog and wrote: Big Icelandic sweater(that was what she was wearing)  and her phonenumber. We met up a couple of times under the festival  and had a small time fling for the duration of the festival. But then that was it.  I still think of her whenever I find the note in the back of one of my drawers. It is old and crumpled  but that year was really amazing. I've been back every year since  except for one year where I was in Africa doing volunteer work  and I could not fit it into my plans.,0
It was my third year at Roskilde festival and our camp was placed in G  just be the fence. As you know alot of people pee by the fence  so that year I saw so many people peeing. One day two guys came to the fence to pee but one of them without shoes  which is unlucky because it was very muddy by the fence. So the the guy with shoes wanted to help his friend without shoes  by lifting him up and placing him on his own head. Then they both peed. The guy with shoes got pis all over him  small drops in his face and alot on his shirt. They laughed so much after and us in the camp to. :D that's true friendship!  ) That's my funniest/best rf16 story :),0
As it happens every year there is one act I just HAVE to see while noone I know is even remotely interested. This year it was Odeza and moments into the concert I had to text my Best friend (who is currently in Cape Town):  I am so happy I can't breathe . Behind me was a guy whom I met at several concerts and with whom I could celebrate with. The happiness lasted all through the night on adventures in Dream City all the way to Citycenter West in the morning where I gathered a group of hungover people for breakfast at my improvised  Nynnes Morgenklubfest   where we shared stories from the night before  petted a dog and read Orange Press out loud before I crashed in my Camp  happy as ever. The perfect houdini. The perfect 12 hours. The perfect festival. 10 years and never letting go!,0
I won a sword fight against a knight at this year's Ros. That's the best story truly.,0
My best Moment was 1999. My first time at roskilde !,0
Exhausted after seven days of partying and above 100 km of walking at this year's Roskilde Festival the Orange Feeling still managed to hit me like a truck at The Minds of 99's closing of Arena. I was at this moment completely sober and had soar feet but I still could not help myself from singing at the top of my lungs and jumping for almost two hours straight. I spent the concert with my very best friends and one of the best bands Denmark has to offer. My festival ended in a perfect manner and I left Roskilde happy as one can be and more than ready for next year!!!,0
Got myself engaged and married the same week?? #RF16,0
it was 18:00  Saturday night  and we had just spent our last energy at Orange  jumpin around to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy. and were actually on our way home after a long and semi-wet festival... No more music for us to see... we were all in a zombie-like state when we staggered down towards our camp.. dreaming of the cozyness that our own beds at home would soon give us...  then... it happened... a friend of ours told us that Immortal Technique was going to replace Freddie Gibbs at midnight  at Avalon...  Suddenly  after hearing that one of the worlds top rappers would show up  all the tiredness disappeared  and we stayed all night partying,0
When me and my friend Met the guy from  hoffe tv  and got this perfect video out of it. And of course every other moment of the festival. My best Roskilde festival so far!,0
I have been at Roskilde festival for 4 years in a row  but there is one experience  which stands out from the bunch. Last year i was at Bikstok Røgsystems concert  which was very nice  and i had planned to go to die Antwoord afterwards  but i did not think that it was safe to be in the pit  but suddently my best freind Kira Løve Bøgeskov calls me and says that i have to hurry up  and that she was holding a place in the queue for the pit to die Antwoord  i decided to go  and we both agree that it was the best experience of our life. We had a blast  and danced the whole concert through and it was not unsafe at all  people were super aware of each other  it is for sure the most fun and the best experience from Roskilde festival of all time. <3,0
My Friend  Asger  and I  were partying through dream city  L and P in our pink outfits! On our way we saw a crying girl. We thought  no one is allowed to cry at Roskilde Festival! We spoke with here and found out that her friends had ditched her..  We looked at each other and wanted to take her on our adventure! So we did.  We were at the best parties and she was happy and smiling! The night was long and we went to our camp. She was tired. It was her first time at the festival  and she lived in the top of C (we were in K).  I said that she could take my tent and I would sleep in a chair. So I did. The following morning I walked her to her camp and I never saw her again.   The mission was to make her happy and forget the bad experience that night. And the mission was completed!,0
Standing with my girlfriend at the Macklemore & Ryan Lewis concert. Macklemore was talking about the Orlando shooting and equality and coming together. My girlfriend and I were getting emotional and holding hands  when a camera man films us just as we are kissing. It was put at the big screens and moments later I got a bunch of texts from friends and family saying they saw us and how much they support us and root for us. That meant the world. The concert was amazing and we were high of the experience for the rest of the festival! #equality #samelove,0
Once i woke up in my tent without a hangover. ??,0
My best #RF16 story has got to be celebrating my sisters birthday! We decorated the whole camp with flags and disco lights. We celebrated for a good 24 hours - first at our own camp and then went on a camp crawl throughout C! Still flying high on the experience!????,0
I think I have at least a million amazing experiences from this years festival. But what makes this the best festival in my opinion  is the people. The people who attend Roskilde is beyond amazing - it is like you get 130.000 new friends  even though you've never actually met before. The level of friendliness and love is completely outstanding and everyone is always welcome everywhere. It is insane and I love every part of it. We were invited into so many camps and parties and events  I've lost count. And when you attend a concert  people are extremely good at helping and protecting each other. The feeling you leave with is beyond anything else!,0
First rime I experienced RF was in 1994? as Bad Religion crew member. I never had the opportunity to come as a guest . Now me being old and my bones gettin tired it is my daughter goin and keeping me updated. This and following you on FB makes me really wish to get the chance to come personally ... Maybe next year??,0
My best #RF16 story  would be when I passed out at the tame impala concert due to dehydration  I got carried out by a random guy  with a broken arm. When I got back up  the guy was still there  so if the guy with the broken arm reads this  thank you! <3  Furthermore after I got back to my camp  I messaged my fellas that there was nothing to worry about - when they got back to the camp  they ran into the tent  yelling and screaming  WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING! ??,0
I once met a norwegian guy called Raymond   who turned out to be a true roskilede hero. On our way to a koncert I had to pee. I went to the toilet and fucking dropped my phone into the toilet! A roskilde toilet  that really are nothing more than a bucket full of shit and piss. Raymond picked my phone out of the toilet!  He put his hand into shit for me! I can't imagine a truer gentleman.  Thank you Raymond  where ever you are.,0
My best story from #RF16 took place wednesday morning. We were visiting another camp  and had breakfast (countless toasts and water bottles was on the menu). Then it started to rain again  so we decided to go inside onw of the tents to keep us dry. We were six people in a three-person tent  so it was just one long spoon. We cuddled and took naps for three hours or so  until the rain was over. Best morning ever!,0
One my best Roskilde moments was in 2002.. I was with a bunch of friends and during warm up we had a friend taped up with gaffa in some sort of challenge.. While he was taped up a group of swedes came by our camp and for some reason we ended up selling the taped up friend for a pack of cigarettes.. They carried him to their camp and  drowned  him in beer.. He came back an hour or two later - really drunk and kinda upset - but still really happy and laughing!! That was hilarious ??????,0
My biggest memory from Roskilde is probably from 2014. I felt asleep in my tent mid day and woke to my alarm ringing loudly right besides my ear. The alarm said 'Major Lazor' and I panicked so hard. I couldnt find any of my friends so I ran from K to Orange in about 10 minutes while drinking half a bottle of shots from a plastic container. I somehow managed to squeeze inbetween lots of people and ended up by the backend fence just before the 'bumaye!' and everyone jumping out of their minds. A night to remember!,0
I don't have a 'best #RF16 story'. I have been to RF the last 5 years  and every time it turns out to be one of the highlights of the year ??? The last 3 years I've been voluteering  and I love to meet all the happy RF-people  while selling train tickets for DSB and RF ???? And the 4 days of music just adds to the perfection of the entire week ????,0
One of my best moments at #rf16 was on the Monday. It was UEFA2016 and the game was England versus Iceland. I and a couple of guys from our camp headed for the local sports bar in downtown Roskilde. The Italy versus Spain game wasn't that exciting. At the pub there was a nice mood. Some Swedes and Norwegians and a couple of Danes. Later two finish guys came and sat by our table. We drank our beer and enjoyed the game. Just before the second game  England vs Iceland. The Icelandic came and the mood just went up two notches. The game began and all of the Nordic countries were represented and you can guess which we rooted for  ) There was excitement and expectations in the air. When England scored the first goal the crowd took a hit  but it wasn't long. Two minutes later Iceland reduced and the roof just went right of. Then Iceland made another goal and the whole pub went crazy! The mood was as high it could be. And when Iceland actually won the game and went to the quarter the night was just complete. I had a big smile on my lips the whole evening and will remember it forever. Purely magical!,0
4th year in a row! My favourite moment is the whole experience. The special feeling of freedom  when you go there. And the fact that I could rock a golden fannypack - only at Roskilde,0
My best story from this year's #rf16 is me and my friend Glenn wanting a cup of coffee with Bailey.. Apparently you can only get alcohol at 9 in the morning when you're as late as we were. We made it to be the goal of our night. Throughout the waiting time we got to spread joy amongst many people and the coffee people gave us free drinks of different kinds of weird coffee's as a thanks for us being there. We got to meet people who had just woken up and got to give them a happy start to their day. We ended up getting the coffee with Bailey and it was so worth it!,0
I got to hear Tame Impala with my best mates! F*cking epic booking at #RF16,0
One of my best moments from #rf16 were when the clock turned 16.00 saturday early afternoon and we were allowed to enter six crazy days filled with nice events  fun with my best friends and lovely music. Thanks for another amazing year,0
I didn't go this year  but i'll share my best rf15 story with you. It was my first time at any festival and I went there all by my self. I spend 9 amazing days with a bunch of people I had never met before  both the volunteers I worked with  or the people whos parties I crashed because I didn't know anyone.:D Next time I will go there with some friends  but it was a blast! :),0
My best story was just when I finally could sit down in our camp with an ice cold beer. I came to the south entry around 14:00 and had to stand in line for three hours. When I got in I walked all over the P area with five tents and our pavillion all by my self. At 18:00 I went back to fence beside the waiting area and sat there for another 4 hours  just waiting for the area to open for camping. After the area opened I ran in an started to make our camp. It took 1-1.5 hour and the time was now 23:30. I went for some beer and my two friends who came around midnight. We sat down in out campand could finally relax at Roskilde Festival '16..,0
At the festival last year  i was sick throughout the whole festival  but I didn't want to miss the festival anyways so iwas stumbling around out on the festival not feeling very well  and with most of my camp gone and the rest not wanting to go to the concerts I wanted to watch  I felt kinda lost  until I come across a girl I at the time only knew a little from school. She wanted to go to the same concert as me  so we went together and had a blast  she afterwards introduced me to the rest of her camp  mainly consisting of classmates. I have never been welcomed as openly by any one my entire life  and I ended up spending the rest of my festival with these people who all quickly became my friends and they are now all my best friends at my gymnasium  I party with them all the time and also lag in camp with them this year where we had an even bigger blast. The craziest part was that halfway through last years festival  me and the girl realised that we where childhood friends who knew eachother since we where 2 months old  we had lost contact since we had  grown apart   well apparently we hadn't grown that much apart.,0
I left my brain at roskilde. Let me go back next year????,0
The end of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy. Everyone age 10-40 met up for a perfect moment in the afternoon sun. I honestly can't stand Dizzy  but right then and there it was the best music ever. To moments like that now and forever.,0
I met my husband in 1990 in 'the green tent' -  Miss B Haven! We are still together and still going to the wonderful Roskilde Festival :) What's not to like :) ??,0
#RF16 was my 11th year at Roskilde  even though I'm only 22. - Thanks to amazing parents showing me the Orange feeling for years  before letting me explore it on my own. This was my 3rd year as a volunteer at a Tuborg stand neer Orange Stage. We always wear nametags. This results in a few random girls saying 'hey Alex' as an icebreaker. So  this year  I once again responded with a random guess on their name  every time. Third time it happened  I went 'hey Sarah!' She was stunned  as was I  cause damn.... Her name was Sarah ??,0
30th anniversary!! From Europe in 1987 to Slayer in 2016 - second year in DC at ØMMF Camp. And it Will NOT be the 'final countdown!' This years best moment where in the pit at 'House of Pain' and Everlast words made my festival even better -'look at my Grey beard  dont ever dye it  i earn everyone of them' and the totalcrazyteatrich performance of Peaches with her hardcore lyrics made me shout 'dick dick dick' !,0
Due to work I decided to skip Roskilde this year  only to regret afterwards. On Thursday (during the week of Roskilde) I was asked if I wanted to go there on Saturday  and I said yes immediately! I got to spend Saturday with my friend  we were having so much fun  jumping around in puddles of water wearing rubberboots  and it was like we were kids again. Going around  exploring the festival  the music & meeting random people was just like I remembered it from the year before  simply amazing. We ended the day at Orange Stage were the Danish singer MØ gave a powerful performance  and gave me an unforgettable memory. This was my #RF16 ????,0
My best #rf16 moment was when I finally decided to buy a one-day ticket for Wednesday on the 29th of June to go and see my brother  that I hadn't seen for a long time. The 29th of June was also his birthday  so I wanted to surprise him. After a lot of missed calls  dead cellphone battery and many hours with rain I finally found him. Luckily  the sun started to shine and we had shitloads of beer  enjoyed the epic RHCP and partied until the sunrise. Thanks for having me  Thomas.,0
OY MANNER! I just slept through this competition! Shit!??  It has been a very rough week for me  going to work on monday  after a great Roskilde festival - even though it was friday today  it felt like it was monday morning?????? Still! Thanks for the greatest festival EVER! My best memory from this year  has to be that me and my close friends  decided  that we will NEVER be too old for Roskilde. I am 35 and my friends are 33  36 and 40  but we charged every concert as there was no tomorrow and jumped into moshpits  singing  Everything is awesooome!  Just feeling Orange and loving every minute of it???? And of course paying a tribute to the 9 people who died at the Pearl Jam concert in 2000  where we also were in the audience - always remebering to take care of each other - Thank you to Roskilde Festival for reminding the audience to take care of each other??,0
Come rain or rain - listening to great music  having fun  and  helping each other is what the Roskilde Festival is all about...! #orangefeeling #rf16 #foals #roskildeblues,0
I was wearing a pink minnie lightning ears (that I brought all way from spain) and they survied not only the WHOLE festival but a moshpit at the slayer concert too (althougt they fell off my head in the middle of it)!!! Irene Roca,0

When the lady came out to announce next day's first concert  people were booing at the sight of her  so loudly you almost couldn't hear her voice  because they wanted CSH back on stage. The whole Pavilion tent was buzzing afterwards. People didn't leave but just stood there  amazed by what they had just experienced. I was high on the experience for days! Probably the best concert I've ever seen on Roskilde Festival. - Shoutout to Hinds  who also gave one of the best concert experiences I've had in a long time with their awesome attitude and honest charm.,0

regret i wasn't there :(,0
Brilliant show from the Bosnian maniacs!  A truly good booking that embraces diversity  well done Roskilde Festival . Next year try and book Greek reggae/ska group Locomondo   i promise they will ensure a party and a half!!,0
That show was like electric shocks to the heart after watching a pretty dull Kraftwerk show. Thumbs up!,0
The best party of 13!!,0
It was scrumtrulescent ! One of the best shows this year!!,0
When will you upload the Suicidal Tendencies show ?,0

I believe it's Roskilde Festival in Denmark. You should all go next year. It's really great.,0
That hit me where I live,0
Take away the flags and the beer and suddenly you have zombies attacking the last human station.,0
I miss roskilde!! I wanna go back in time!,0
Says it all.,0
AFAIK the band didn't permit the festival to stream their concert. Thus it probably won't be available at the website either.,0
What Anders said. We didn't get permission to record the Slipknot show.,0

Stefan Thorsvang Petersen  we don't have a fixed date on this yet. You should try this contest in the meantime.,0
and here comes Capt. BuzzKill: Using storify  you grant access to the data you provide to e.g. facebook  twitter  etc. This looks like data-whoring on a whole new level  because storify quite litterally wants all you private information.

Søren Kuhl  this is about open data. You don't have to use your own material in this contest. If you find a great tweet or the perfect picture on Flickr - both by someone else - you can use them. Ss long as they're shared.,0
@RF  well  as long as one does not associate any of ones own social media accounts with storify  that is quite true. I shall look forward to the the first stories. In the meantime  I'll just enjoy my friend's RF stories at my local pub in krystalgade.

Get the T-shirt here: http://bit.ly/RonEnglish. As a bonus the artist Ron English has signed a unique Ron English skull poster which will be shipped with the T-shirt free of charge.,0
Damn that's one pricey piece of cotton.,0
Agreed. But  I reckon it's because both Roskilde and the artist want to earn something from it? It's awesome anyhow :D,0
Sandra It's a unisex model. Sorry that it doesn't say so in the webshop.,0
Christian That's a mistake. Thanks for letting us know  -),0
Its comes with a signed  full-color poster too!,0

Buuuuuut you do have the clips from Slipknot  right? As I recall seeing multiple cameras that night :D,0
Nope  we don't. That was just live production for the big screens.,0
Painting the world orange...  Roskilde Festival 2013 was visited by people from 63 countries.,70
And   Ecuador  too,0
I  bougth  by  internet  ticket  we  stay  in get  a  tent  downtown  we  gonna  coma  2014  we  love  roskilde,0
Raving Saudis and Sudanese! ^_^,0
can you please include Portugal. i was a Portuguese volunteer in the festival,0
64! I stayed in a same room with a lady from Ethiopia. No orange there on the map!,0
If I'm ethnically from a country that haven't been painted orange  does that count? ^^,0
You are missing 'India...,0
what the hell?! Portugal is NOT orange?! Next year I'll make sure that doesn't happen again!!,0
Kenya too. I know that it wasn't in your sales records  but it's nice to know :),0
Croatia was there too  ) (but yeah  ticket bought in DK) :),0
Where is Portugal??,0
Where is Uganda? I was there too. Uganda in East Africa should be painted orande too.,0
Roskilde is taking over the world!! Muhahhahaha!! <3,0
Sure there was not a single person from india? :s,0
I am living in the Philippines  so please color the Philippines orange also  ),0
Reppin' Bangladesh. Funny that there are barely any South Asian participants..,0
What about Faroe Islands? :),0
I personally served more than ten vodka shots to a festival guest from India  so I'd say the subcontinent deserves recognition for its participation in the Orange Feeling.,0
Venezuela is missing there! And my camp was full of Venezuelan people! can you please add it ! Cheers,0
You forgot all pocket thieves and bottle collectors from Somalia.......,0
Honestly. No one from india? Ever???,0
Came from Australia for Roskilde and loved every minute of it. Will try my best to get back ASAP.,0
Kaliningrad oblast is a part of Russia  you could mark that as well. (its the non coloured part between Lithuania and Poland),0
Kaliningrad between Poland and Lithuania is a Russia too.,0
Not a single person from Portugal?,0
hey you didn't highlight bosnia :(,0
We were there from the philippines tooooooo....,0
I brought a guy from India this year and he Will be back next year :),0
Many people has got their tickets by their friends   with Danish addresses but I think that does not matter if you send the ticket to Venezuela o Australia  I've been there as many of them  and many people can proof it with pictures! That is not enough? If not I don't care really!,0
I love you Roskilde Festival. You are a good festival. I had a great time. But I must say  waking up in the morning in a really warm tent feels like that scene from Ace Ventura 2 when he climbs out of the Rhino's asshole. But it's a part of the experience. Love you  Roskilde. See you next year!,0
Lotte  yes I was threre and I am from Costa Rica but I bought my ticket in another country.,0
Hi guys You forgot about Thailand. I brought one friend from the land of smiles.,0
So I hope for being with you next time - not adding a new country but one happy musicfan more with a stunning live-experience... :),0
Rico Gonzalez  Carlanga Moreno  Harold Gonzalez  Abel Fernando Zamudio all live in Venezuela and came to be part of Camp Latin Crew  the Camp has lots of other Venezuelans that lives in DK or EU. But those 4 came straight from Vz! So Pls make Vz Orange,0
YES! I came from Canada twice and can't want to come back!!,0
Not one person from India!? Really?!?,0
ADD INDIA :) i was there!,0
Dave Trivino  really? We don't have any sales records on that.,0
Dave Trivino  in that case  we need you to imagine Equador painted orange.,0
And Bengalis and Morrocans,0
Diogo Passagem  that's great! Portugal should be included  then - but this is only based on the sales records.,0
We met a guy that came all the way from Nicaragua aswell. a bit more that 63 countries i guess :),0
Hanna Backända  Ethiopia wasn't included in our sales records. But it seems that this is getting bigger and bigger. Who knows  maybe we have the whole world covered without knowing it?,0
Oh  it might also be because of she hadn't bought her tick  kinda with da crew. But she was there!,0
Kim Ekstø  wow  really? This just keeps growing and growing :-),0
Amin Subkhan  if only our records could tell THAT :-),0
Raj Momo Manoharan  really? We have no records of purchases from Indian addresses in 2013.,0
Roskilde Festival Its because it May not include the organisations who were working there never mind  ),0
That will show 'em :D,0
Pedro Nabais  we just found out that Diogo (to be found somewhere in this comment thread) was a volunteer and he's Portuguese. But you go ahead and make that wonderful country of yours orange in 2014. Can't wait to see you! :-),0
Yeah  he even gave me a handmade shirt from his homecountry. the orange feeling spreads out too all  no matter where they're from! Love this festival  allready looking forward to next year!,0
Raj Momo Manoharan  that's right. Should count  nonetheless.,0
Roskilde Festival More orange :D,0
Hanna Backända  that's sounds like a good reason. Let's make that country count nonetheless.,0
Søren Andersen  we have only looked at the sales records. Obviously we should have included our volunteers' list and more  which would have included the African Youth Panel.,0
Per Beck Hansen  so  who's from Kenya that we don't know of?,0
A volunteer I was working with at Nordisk Pastahus and probably some of his friends as well,0
Robert Nkwangu  sorry about not including your country. Imagine Uganda nice and orange. Did you buy a ticket or participate in some other way at Roskilde 2013?,0
João Ricardo Devesa  we have no sales records of Roskilde-goers from Portugal. But we've just learned that we did have a Portuguese volunteer. You went as well?,0
Mia Scap  ah  if only we could detect that :-),0
The most important thing is that i visited Roskilde and this year was my third. There were youth from Mozambique  Gambia  Ghana  Nigeria  Ethiopia. The African Youth Panel was there. Yeah  we visited Roskilde.,0
Gina Sahra Armstrong  more like the world is taking over Roskilde - which is just the way we like it!,0
Per Beck Hansen  aha  we should have included the volunteers' list as well. That would give us the full picture.,0
In other words 64 countries...,0
Raj Momo Manoharan  lots of orange. Especially since India's a BIG country.,0
Mads E.B. Madsen  got it! If only we could update the picture without re-posting.,0
Huxi Fooking Brøndhal  there could be. But we have no sales records of people with an Indian address. Maybe as a volunteer - or maybe the ticket was purchased in another country. Hard to say.,0
Robert Nkwangu  ah  you were part of the African Youth Panel! That's explains it. Sorry about that. You should definitely be represented - but we have only looked at our sales records. Africa is now a way much more orange continent :-),0
Asbjørn Olling  right  we did have some representatives from Bangladesh.,0
Anyways  I'll remember these lovely African ladies in the same room for the rest of my life. A true example of the Orange Feeling. My bag didn't arrive with the same plane as I did and they lend me their clothes so I wouldn't get cold in the night. <3!,0
well done Diogo. One for the team. Next year it will be my duty. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it.,0
Bárður Skaalum  we should have a serious chat with the people who did this map - because The Faroe Islands are no where to be found. So  you should image a tiny dot on the map being orange  because we DO have the Faroe Islands represented in our sales records.,0
Stephan Seifert  these are just number from 2013 - so we wouldn't say ever.,0
Matt Wenzel  we hope you enjoyed it. We have quite a few Australians (and Kiwis) every year at Roskilde  which is both great and impressive - considering the distance you have to travel to get here.,0
Marie Louise Thomassen  nope just our audience.,0
Magnus Langesø Hjorth  we don't want that language in here.,0
Kathy Place  really? We have no sales records of people from Venezuela. That's weird. Were they volunteers  or did someone in another country buy their tickets?,0
Brian E. Schmidt  apparently  Venezuela IS missing. But facts is that we don't have any sales records of Venezuelian addresses.,0
Jon Toivo Hansen  consider it done! If only we could update the picture without re-posting.,0
Vaidas Zdancevicius  sorry about that. It was a MANUAL paint job and we might have missed some details.,0
Anton Marchenko  sorry about that. We marked the countries manually  and we have obviously missed some details.,0
 ) I'll certainly never forget the smiling  crippled lawyer Bapu  who hung out in Burundi Bar for an entire day  chatting up the volunteers. How I wish I'd taken pictures.,0
Jaakko Tulkki  we learned that we did have at least one Portuguese volunteer. But as far as our record sales show  no one with a Portuguese address purchased a ticket to this year's Roskilde Festival.,0
Olá Diogo! Was easy to apply/enter to the Rolskilde's volunteer team? I tried english festivals  but I wasn't successful :(,0
I do in fact know at least 2 people from India personally that went this year. They do work in Denmark however  so that maybe why it's not registered.,0
Marianne Andersen  if the ticket was sent to Denmark  then it counts as a Danish ticket even though it may not be the case. Let's just imagine The Philippines as very orange islands.,0
Johnny Engberg  that's exactly why.,0
Dubioza Kolektiv was great :D,0
Farah Hasanbegovic  are you from Bosnia  and did you visit the festival? Our ticket records don't show any Bosnian addresses.,0
Hi Diego Vicuña  is this a shout-out to your wonderful country - or did you in fact visit the festival? The thing is that our ticket records don't show any addresses in Equador.,0
What if you a volunteering for the festival and live in the Philippines? We only get the check-in by mail :P,0
But you got one for next years update. LP,0
Marianne Andersen  that'll be tough to remember - but we'll try our best :-),0
Hey Rico Gonzalez  did you visit Roskilde this year? The reason we're asking is that Venezuela doesn't show in our ticket records.,0
No correct  a friend from Panama was there !,0
Falko Costa Rica Touren  Panama as well? Wow  great. We've almost got that Middle American strip covered.,0
Trine Chilie Thode + Tom Nielsen  Venezuela is indeed orange  we can tell.,0
@That's great  Ellen Odegaard - we remember communicating with you over Twitter a year back. Great to hear that you're still a part of team ORANGE.,0
Samir Dughiem  Lebanon as well. Great!,0
Trine Chilie Thode  for now we have to imagine Venezuela as a very orange country - since we can't replace the picture without doing a re-post.,0
Ute Bescht  it doesn't matter if you add a new country to the list. What matters is that you try this - we guarantee the best experience.,0
Steen Christensen  check! Thailand is now also orange - we just have to imagine it for now – because we can't replace the picture without doing a repost.,0
I know  guys  I know - you are always staging the BEST!,0
Alan Bolero  that's great. Costa Rica is now a bit more orange.,0
Jonathan Rostad Knudsen  sorry  can't do much about those hot mornings - but we're glad to hear that you're enjoying it anyways.,0
Kathy Place  sorry we didn't mean it that way. Of course it doesn't matter how people got their tickets. We're just very interested in knowing where everybody's from - and it seems that this world map should be way more orange :-),0
Great to hear  Nikolaj Kjellerup Andersen. That's the impact Roskilde Festival has on people :-),0
My friend from Kenya was there as well. Just paint it all Orange.,0
I was representing the Kiwi's  ) This year was my third Roskilde -I'm hooked!,0
Yeah you can do something about that. Silver coloured tent  try it!,0
Jacob Rosenhoff  no one is registered with an address in India. That much we know. But we've learned that we did have some people from India at the festival - someone else probably received the tickets for them.,0
or peeing in your own mouth before you go to bed...,0
India was SO there  im indian but i work in cph .,0
Hanna Báralíd  Faroe Islands are definitely represented  but for some reason they're not on the map.,0
awesome! great festival by the way,0

If you bought a ticket from someone you don't know.. Is there any way you can check it's not a fake ticket or the person haven't printed it out 10 times and sold all of em? .,0
Hey everyone ! :D I need full tickets for #RF15 ...comment or prv msg :),0
Foo Fighters  Editors and Placebo for next years line-up  one of the few bands  I havent seen live yet  and really want to see. And long time ago  they've visited the festival. ,0

And night!,0
english version: hey roskilde. how come the bridge by M is back again this year? we all thought it would disappear together with lovecamp. ,0
Short answer: Simply because of passing traffic on that specific road.,0
what about the people who were hurt at the bridge? is it going to be more safe this time?,0
We'll make sure it's safe and sound.,0
What Christian says.,0
We'll make sure it's safe and sound.,0
In English  please :-)  If you plan to arrive AFTER Saturday 30 June at 18:00 without an entrance booking  you can get in when the queues have diminished - meaning  when the festival-goers WITH bookings have entered.,0
Okay  thank you :-) I have an entrance booking  but was hoping that I could get the regular wristband (I'll be arriving with my camps luggage)  so I wouldn't have to stand in line the next day.. But if I arrive 30 June at around 8 PM that shouldn't be a problem  right?,0
 Regular wristband ? You get the same wristband no matter when you arrive. I'm not sure I understand what you mean...,0
Last year I got a temporary wristband made of paper. This was to make sure  that us with entrance booking would get in faster and then we could later exchange this wristband to the regular one :),0
Right  if you arrive later there'll be no need for a temp wristband.,0
Okay  thank you very much!,0
How many tickets left?,0
That remains a secret. But if you haven't bought one yet  better go get it before it's too late.,0
I already have my ticket.  Just wanted to know if you are close to sold out. Lot of people = Big party = Better festival :D,0
It's looking good!,0
Nice! See you! :D,0
Luckily we have 8 stages  so we suggest you go see something else if you don't like it.,0
Let me just say that I didn't expect a festival like Roskilde to announce such an act..,0
Roskilde has always had its fair share of straight up pop music on the programme. Check out the first two headliners on this poster :)  http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Plakater/plakat-2001.jpg,0
I didn't expect Roskilde to book Niklas to the festival  but off course he is hyped up by a lot of people.. Niklas is really disappointing. I know that the people who don't want to hear him just needs to not show up  but it's probably some of the worst music to come out of Denmark for a looooong time. Sad  and not the type of music Roskilde normally books  and for a very good reason! -Since Roskilde now announced  Niklas   Why not book Lil Wayne too! :-) and I mean Lil Wayne in a good way  since i would prefer Lil Wayne over a lot of artists,0
Niklas is probably the worst  musician  Denmark ever coughed up. I've seen him live  and no. It's not good. At all. I'd rather see Aqua which is a waaay bigger danish act than Niklas'l ever be.,0
True.. after seeing Niklas Live In Ribe  it was a bit of disappointment  but who knows maybe he will be step it up at Roskilde  -),0
Hahaha cool and then you go making a meme out of it xD,0
Bjørn: Lil Wayne has actually been booked once. He cancelled because he had to go to jail and had to be replaced by another band. Check out Mac Miller in this year's lineup if you like Wayne – they've collaborated occasionally:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7rFLxE5yI  As for Aqua I went past the Green stage  when they played in '01. It really sucked.,0
Mac MIller is one of the best on this years line-up.,0
Anders Cold: Yeah I know that he has been booked before to Roskilde Festival before  I would wish that he would be booked again  because I really want to see Wayne Live! that would be the best! He is one of my favorite rappers  I'm also looking forward to Mac Miller  he's one of the best on the line up this year  and so is Santigold and Wiz Khalifa :-),0
We came all the way from Canada to party with you at Roskilde :) Thanks Rockwool for the awesome shelter!,0
 Playing Orange Stage is a pretty fucking legendary thing to do - especially as a Danish musician - and I am so fucking proud and happy that I had my #OrangeStage virginity taken together with u excellent ppl!! (And with a crowd so GOD DAMN AMAZING!!!) I hope this was not the last time for all of us to share the love. I will never ever forget this night.  - MØ ??,0

The aliens came to visit us ????,0
who can i contact about missing stuff?,0
thanks a lot!!,0
This MAY have something to do with a video we're promoting later. Watch out for it.,0
This is something for Roskilde Festival. Take a look at the poster and count the women on it  that will go very fast.,0
I would guess it´s even more than 88% at Roskilde Festival.,0
To say that there are  few women in the music business  is just ignorant. Not buying it.,0
And even if that was true  it's not an excuse.,0
Counting the all-female or female-dominated (/fronted) bands/artists at RF 2013  I make them out to be about 30 of 200  so it's not more. An 85% male-dominated lineup is still disappointingly lop-sided though. Wouldn't mind a more female lineup. Sometimes I just find it difficult to point at relevant female names to book  so I guess it's more of an inherent industry problem than Roskilde's.,0
We see what you mean  Sofia Berg  and you're not the first one to address this problem. In fact  there was a whole media thing about it in Denmark not that long ago.  Fact is that there are few women in the music business  especially female musicians. That's a problem that should be dealt with somewhere else in the 'food chain'. When having few female artists to choose between  few female artists will be chosen. And that's not just at Roskilde Festival. That's everywhere. If you take a look at your record collection  chances are that the inequality between male/female artists is the same or maybe even with a greater presence of male artists.  On the other hand  we have an equal 50/50 division between male/female Roskilde-goers.,0
Amanda Ström  it's not ignorant. It's a fact. And the major change should start somewhere else  not at a festival. We know you probably disagree  but this is our viewpoint.,0
Trust me  there are A LOT of struggling women in the music business (maybe not that many musicians but thats another problem that starts already in elementary school when girls are expected do dance and the boys to play drums and guitar). The problem is that they dont get signed to the big labels  and is therefore not visible for you. So for next year  maybe you could lead the way for all the other Scandinavian festivals looking up to you and book some more female artists for at least the warm up days? Because as you say yourself  on pavillion junior is where you find the big names of tomorrow. Im not asking you to have 50/50 division for next year  what i want is for you to enlighten this and as i said before lead the way as you do with so many other things for other festivals.,0
Amanda: It IS true. As a professional reviewer  I'd say that only 20-something percent of the stuff I get thrown is by all-female artists or female-fronted/dominated bands. The music industry is run by males and it shows.,0
We announce 5 new acts: Gossip  Lee Fields & The Expressions  Gentleman  Niklas and Spillemændene  Read more: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/last-batch-of-bands-ready-for-roskilde-festival-2012/,55

I have the same problem  and did the same things - It's sort of stressfull  not knowing if I'm gonna be able to get in with the rest of my camp!,0

Hello all festival brothers and sisters. Please help me.  My keys and bike got stolen late last night from the bike parking at entrance East.  If you see it please set it aside and maybe give it to a festival crew employee  and contact me here on Facebook.

Hello Roskilde Festval: I just had a terrible experience at the Arena Stage during the New Order concert. One of the members of the staff forced me to leave  and another one forced me to open my bag. They couldn't find anything  because I am not carrying anything illegal. Once they were done inspecting  they told me it was  for security . I had never experienced such a thing in my life. So far it has been a terrific festival  but I still can't understand what just happened. I am Mexican. I seriously hope this was not a racist act. Thank you very much for reading  and I hope this sort of situation won't happen again in the future.,0
Hello Roskilde Festival!  For how long will the temporary wristbands be valid?,0
Until Monday at 08:00,0
Is it necessary to get entrance booking if you plan to arrive around 9pm the first day?,0

Lasse  dont be a hater,0
@Lasse - No one is forcing your arm! You don't wanna watch the soccer game  stay in your camp and get wasted! Don't be a hater! Hate only breeds hate! ^_^,0
Do you show other matches  or just the final?,0
190 DKK for a crate of beer? You're pushing it a bit Roskilde..,0
@Mikkel - I couldn't agree more. I remember a couple of years ago it was 164 -. But hey! at least we got Springsteen...........,0
@Henrik: Not really  since there aren't any other matches being played during the festival (:,0
last year it was only around 175 - what is this shit,0
What about UXO BAR? Still not gonna happen? I want my bloody mary.,0
concerning beer prices  notice the  all prices include refund (if any) -line at the end. So the 190 kr. is the total price  including 24 kr. of refund - which is the same price as last year,0
Lucky the city is near  and filled of cheaper beer!  -),0
Suddenly  a wild chess game appears.  ????????  ????????  ????????  ????????,0
Hello - I have read the part about cell-phones and recharging. It seems that it is  same procedures as every year  James  - unfortunately. I know it is late but could you please look into other forms of recharging aswell? For example some sort of self-service lockers with recharging.,0
The Current system is intolerable with LOOOOOOONG lines and filled up charging stations.,0
You can make your own :) We used a car battery  provied 15 peeps with enough power for an intire festival.,0
we only show the final in the Euro 2012 since it´s the only game taking place during the festival.,0
@ Troels - WOW do you have a  recipe ??,0
@Lasse The prices have always included refund  so there's no excuses  the price is just higher. I just don't hope they raise it further next year  they could lose a lot of money on this,0
Mikkel  you're wrong. The listed prices last year on the website and in rthe programme book did not include refund. This year they do.,0
Bjarke  please don't call us greedy. That's both unfair and untrue.,0
hmm  maybe I put the price in the program myself then to make it easier :P Still  the price is higher unfortunately.. Oh well  more money to a good cause I guess :),0
Okay. Just to get things straight...  This year a cold crate of 24 beers is sold at the camping area at 166 DKK (+24 DKK refund). Ignoring refund that is 6 92 DKK a beer  Last year an also cold crate of 24 beers were sold at 156 DKK (+24 DKK refund). That's 6 50 DKK for a beer.  So yes  a crate of 24 beers has gone up with 10 DKK. But taking inflation (2-2 5%)  sugar taxes and such into account  this actually means that the festival  in the end  earns 0 50 DKK LESS pr. sold crate this year  compared to last year (according to our  beer dude  at the festival).  And if you think that's expensive  then feel free to haul in one billion liters of beer bought elsewhere to the camping area. Just don't automatically throw the  greedy  card at us. Nothing could be further from the truth.,0
Is it not possible to re-freeze your freezer packs this year? I have looked all through the practical information  but nowhere to be found?,0
@Bjarke: ok....actually. I would also love to have cases of free beer appear magically out of thin air. That....could be cool :-),0
...that aside the point was just that we we're actually not making more money by raising the price 10 DKK  just keeping up. And yes  of cause we also want you to buy the brew and hence bring ind gold for the causes  since we are also a huge fundraiser  but generally we find the prices quite good compared to other festivals etc (very much actually). It's okay to disagree  and we'll try to keep them low  but we will never beat the supermarket prices and do not intend to really,0
@Nikolaj: under 'luggage storage': In the luggage storages at CITYcentre East and West cooling elements can be exchanged free of charge.,0
@Søren: if it is not alreafy in the KFUM Kiosks onsite  then it is definitely a good idea,0
Others can't make money at that price  they are dragging people in for them to buy other stuff (1 box a person...),0
Problem is that my heart actually finds the prices quite fair (fun fact: a case of beer in the late 90's weree 300+ DKK for 30 pcs) and I actually believe that the festival would not be making more money for the cause by lowering them further....just get everyone more drunk (which is of course not necessarily a bad thing),0
...or was it 400+ DKK for a crate in the 90's? I can't remember. I just remember that I (the Facebook admin writing you now - being 18'ish back then) found them absolutely insane and ended up hauling crate after crate from town and back to the festival camp. So I know the feeling :-),0
@Bjarke: True. Comparisons to the past only makes this admin sound like an old fart. Sorry. We will of course watch out that our prices won't rip your wallets  but still find them fair everything considered.,0

Dear Anna.   Of course we shouldn't accept sexism at Roskilde Festival. We know that it does take place  but we haven't experienced it as an extensive matter. That being said  one incident is just as serious a matter as one million – but we we haven't heard about that many incidents (maybe because they weren't reported?).  You should know that we have a tolerance team - which is our way of dealing with such matters. They're a qualified personnel who contact the people in question and have a serious talk with them.  If you have other suggestions as to how to handle such matters even better  we'd love to hear them. As long as they're based on openness and dialogue instead of simple condemnation. That's the idea behind starting up the tolerance team.  We're open to doing more if we can find the right approach  and we'd love to hear your input. To collect all inputs and to make sure they get to the right people  please do send an e-mail to info@roskilde-festival.dk - as of now we're evaluating and considering what can be done next year  so now's your window.,0
Oops! :) Thank you for taking my input seriously  and for expressing your willingness to address this matter. I will be happy to send you my input about what can be done (and to get more inputs from others). You are right that information is the key to changing attitudes. The reason why incidents like being groped  shouted at etc. are usually not reported  is most likely that most victims do not even consider that they have an option to do so  but put up with it as they think that noone will even take them seriously. This is a part of our  lad culture/boys will be boys   which tolerates men and boys harassing women and girls in the street  at schools  workplaces  on the beach  in parks  festivals and the public sphere in general. I'm not talking about serious assaults (although they of course also happen)  but the staring  commenting  catwhistling  shouting and touching  that happens all the time  everywhere. So most girls just put up with it but are nevertheless very affected by it. I think you know what I mean. Thank you again for showing your willingness to battle this type of behaviour  and I will get back to you. Best regards  Anna.,0
What do you base this on?,0
I want to give out a big thank you to the DJ down by the hexagon building who played some kicking house/techno in the circle of white stools. Had me dancing till 4 in the morning! Big love  one of my highlights,0

Did you like the new Apollo Zone?  Now you can download the Apollo Jingle created by ELOQ and Tomas Barfod here: http://bit.ly/ApolloJingle  Photo: Steffen Jørgensen,22
IMO the Apollo Zone should be moved further into the camp area  or just longer away from the main festival area. I saw a lot of concerts at Apollo  and I enjoyed the amounts of bass that the scene was capable of delivering  but it wasn't as enjoyable when I was listening to music on Pavillion  as the bass from the Apollo scene completely ruined some of the Pavillion music.,0
Loved it!,0
No!,0
WE WANT JAZZ AND CHILLSTEP ON APOLLO!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
The Apollo stage could be placed on the other side of that grassfield facing west. That would make the Walk from the bridge to the festival area Michael easier,0
The late night Apollo raves and performances was one of my favourite places to hang out at during the nights. The light and sound setup was disgustingly awesome!,0
It's great! Definitely living in the AP zone next year again. Thanks Roskilde!,0
It smelled soooo bad over there  but when that was forgotten I had a couple good times.,0
The sound over there was amazing. Drop that bass!,0
Apologies to my old camp mate  stage manager  and master of ceremony at Apollo  Lars (last name edited out) but although it was better this year  Apollo is still an abomination that either has to go completely  or at the very least rethink the location. A good spot would be the still unused old gravel pit area north of H with the stage pointing directly towards the festival area and Orange stage.,0
LOVE IT!!!!!,0
Well  it lengthened the route to the festival area slightly and forced me to listen to some (mostly) inane music on the way there. But to each his own. I'm sure it's great if you like techno.,0
No  i think the bass ruined alot of good concerts  when you just came from the Orange scene and have had a great concert it all was destroyed by the annoying bass and sounds  I think it is bad placed.  And trough the day you could really enjoy the place around the Apollo scene. For an example  when I was sitting in the reload station  the bass shook the whole place and was kinda louder than the music itself. I could really hear the music.... I think it is an annoying scene!,0
never went there/:,0
Best scene @ Roskilde this year. Loved it  was there everyday for atleast one show,0
The Apollo was real f***ing nice and especially in the the warm-up day the party was crazy at night! Keep dancing !,0
Yeah it was a blast except for the ignorant fools who threw unopened beer cans and bottles random up in the sky. Im pretty sure you'll get knocked out if hit by one of those.,0
It was sick!!!!!!!,0
Apollo's Home!!,0
I think it was a great startup with Apollo at the new location. I guess that Apollo will be a true sister-stage to Orange in a couple of years (when I see the success of eg. Tomorrowland). Today it's pretty much  The old hears rock at Orange  and the young ones hear electronic music whereever it's presented. However the young ones will be the future of RF in a couple of years so its great that RF develops this scene also. For me it's great that Apollo is open-air and not in a tent. This year was clearly just a test - try next year to setup pits and then invite someone like David Guetta to really introduce this new scene.,0
NO WAY - Apollo sucks!,0
as a volunteer working at Apollo I just want to say thanks for all the comments  suggestions and nice words - we(the whole crew) had a blast working on and behind the stage. Already looking forward to RF 2014 and we will of course do our best to create an even better Apollo experience next year and that also means looking at all the comments about the stage. So thank you very much!,0
Really brilliant arena  Disclosure's show was fantastic.,0
Elsker Apollo :D,0
It feels like you have put all you focus on new bands this year  so i hope you will look at  Three Loco  - this band is really new in USA  and have already had a lot of succes with their fist single called  Neato  I hope you will take a look,0
Remember  today at 23.59 (Danish time) is your last chance to upload your set of rules to the Roskilde Festival Dice Game.  The best three games submitted will each be rewarded with 2 tickets to Roskilde 2012!,1

We don't comment on rumours. But we can say this: If you know you want to go to Roskilde 2012  get a ticket now. At some point it may be too late. And we see it every year - people full of regrets that they didn't buy a ticket in time.,0
Is there any reason why you can't comment on that? Would be funny to know if there is 1000 og 10.000 tickets left! :-),0
Non-profit organisation baa. 157 mill from ticket only 30 mill to music what in heck goes all pesetas increase your bandbudget or roskilde shall fade away,0
We can talk about it if the festival doesn't sell out. So far  the past decade has been sold out every year  except the ones following a year with heavy rain.,0
Also  your numbers seem to be random guesstimates. – plus  you think that seven stages  hundreds and thousands of m2's of camping space with facilities cost nothing?,0
it's all about the money(music) the numbers ar not guesses due your math 77500x1790 900x20000 a have bin ther 35 yers so i can the plaza no offence,0
or due you want RF a springtime fore danish kids instead fore a topp klass international festival it was a koppel years a goo det är bare til valg :-),0
Your music budget is a far out  wild guess with barely any footing in reality except for loose rumours thrown about by the press. Your ticket estimate may be more accurate  but you don't account for the charges billetlugen.dk levies on the tickets nor do you know the exact number of tickets on sale.   Roskilde is still very much about the music. I have about twice as many must-sees on this year's programme as I usually manage to see in one year  so I'm quite happy with it. My problem is just to choose from all the good stuff on display.,0
i am just an old fart widaut feets i guess. Go festival. TOOL rules!!,0
Ah  but the world NEEDS its old farts. I think it's the 14th time I'm going this year. Still hasn't gotten old to me...,0

Dear RF..  Why do we  as volunteers (meaning us who makes the wheels turn) get our rights and possiblities taken piece by piece in the volunteer camp area  while we still have to pay the same?  Make the area bigger instead of stuffing more people in on the same tiny spot..  Or make Volunteer camp free for volunteers.. Why should we pay the same year after year when you take rights and possibilities from os every damn year?!  Do you realize what human resource management means?? Means making your volunteers feel like their work is appreciated.. Not doing this right now...,0

Thanks for a great one Roskilde. See you next year with an even more awesome #CoffinBlaster!,0
Thank  so much for yet another GREAT festival! I only heard about 10 names  though i wanted to see around 70. I've had some of my best concerts this year (Mokoomba  Chinese Man  Crystal Castles fx) and ive had a great camping with my best friends. The great popname  was a great success with the crowdnumber  but next year  find someone who doesn't accidentally drink water while her playback is on :-)  I really love Roskilde Festival  and its so sad to leave my home for the next year. I really look forward to the next releases <3 All the love i can give to you is given. Thanks for another unforgettable year!,0
LOST AND FOUND! Hej! This cute couple wanted me to make a picture of them  but transferring by our mobiles didn't work. Perhaps you'll get it on that way.,0
Hello Roskilde Festival 2013. Chances are small very small  but seriously I'm missing two small gold rings .. Please contact me if anyone should be 110% more lucky than any other normal people. - Thank you,0
Wish to buy tickets,0
Sometimes you need to see things a bit from above to make out the bigger picture. There's 130.000 of us down there. That makes us the fourth biggest  city  in Denmark - at least for a week. That's a lot of love.,170
Post some pictures from Bring Me The Horizon's set please :),0
Selected snaps from some of the concerts Tuesday  Wednesday and Thursday. Captured by our great team of photographers.,11
A video from Roskilde Festival 2013. Thanks for this year's festival!,0
Thanks to these great people who help me in volunteers info. sad that I could not talk to you when you came to my job  wish I could turn back time and thank you properly. I really wish that you read this. / Swedish girl,0
are crystal castles concert gonna get up on orange tv ?.,0
Our intimate stage Gloria announce a challenging schedule of mesmerising music from Africa  The Caribbean and Eastern Europe. http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/musical-obsession-at-the-gloria-stage/,1
We are happy here!,0
Damn straight it's challenging.,0
I wouldn't label Son Palenque as something too challenging. I mean  this one is damn funky!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nyfe-P2Y5c,0
We expect to have the map ready next week.,0
Handy and creative?   Dream City needs an Infoboard to communicate all the great events and happenings taking place in Dream City during the festival.   Design the Infoboard and win a ticket for Roskilde Festival 2012.   Deadline is Monday at 5 pm. Go!,1
after a case of beer  sure I am.,0
Martin  then get to it  -)... No entries so far and a ticket up for grabs for the best design!,0
Suit arrived today  got that orange feeling :),0
Hi! When can we expect the official Roskilde site map to be released? thank you,0
Hi Denniz. We will post them on Orange TV bit by bit during the next months. But it won't be long until the first one will be up.,0
I want to make a suggestion for next year. The Massive sound systems that some camps bring should be limited to west or east  with the other side depending on which has the sound systems have the concept of hygge (not silent and clean) boom boxes would still be allowed and not silenced after 22. This would allow the return of hygge camps that do group activities and instruments such as guitars be brought along and bring back a large part of social aspect which i feel has disappeared over the last three years. A kind of heaven and hell concept.,0
Something like that  or  just more Silent & Clean areas. One on the west side of the train tracks  maybe?,0
We don't delete posts unless they're discriminating or attacking someone. What was the post about?,0
There you have it - you may not have meant it that way  but the text really said that all Romanians are thieves and we can't tolerate such statements on our page.,0
Sorry Roskilde  I don't see Thomas's statements as racist... It was pretty obvious from the daily police report in the Roskilde paper that Romanians where a problem this year.. If you don't want to give this impression don't state the nationalities of the criminals in the written media. It might be controversial to point at one country as the sinner  but facts support this.,0
Looks like Orange Stage? CAMP SILVER's beer bongs. Orange feeling!,0
Things are not slowing down. At all. Today: More music and more madness. What are you looking forward to hear?,72

Hey Roskilde. I was so sad when I found out that you had closed your cinema.  Or to be fair  you closed the tent and made it a outdoor drive-in like cinema - which is cool to try  by the way.   But... Do you have any plans for reopening the cinema tent next year? I really loved that you could go to see movies in the morning/midday  instead of only at the evening and night like this year.  I remember that I saw The Hangover - Las Vegas in the morning one day in 2010  and that was one of the most funny  positive and just plain great experiences from my time at Roskilde - ever. ,0
Came from Scotland and had the best time ever!!! :D Tak  Roskilde! skaaaaaaaaaaaaal xxxxxx,0
FACT: #RF13 heals festivalgoers! We found 3 wheelchairs and a pair of crutches left behind - apparently not needed anymore  so that proves it of course  -)  Also: Keys  bags  vallets  student's caps  a hairdryer  a deck of Magic: The Gathering cards and much more.  If you lost your stuff you can get it at the festival HQ today and tomorrow from 10.00 to 18.00 (Havsteensvej 11  4000 Roskilde  phone +45 51586886). After tomorrow everything is turned over to the lost property office of Midt- og Vestsjælland’s Police in Roskilde (Skovbogade 3  4000 Roskilde  phone: +45 46 35 14 48). Note that we do not mail out stuff  so you'll need to physically come and get it.,124
I want my virginity back!,0
I didn't get my main luggage from the luggage depot. Where can I get it? I'm from dk.,0
@RF i lost my wallet on festival site. Contains id with adress etc. Any chance you guys mail it to owners if found  or is that too extensive??,0
Hello! I'm trying to call the number from Finland but it doesn't work and I think I left my keys there! Help :(,0

WTF Helge!!! I need it back SOOOOO bad! Plastic turkey is a realy good friend of mine:),0
Thank you for another great festival. My 15th in a row and i will come back next year. BUT i have some suggestions/critics about this year that i want to share. What is the best mail to send them to?  As much is i love Roskilde and all your enormous effort to plan the BEST festival in the world the  line  in for this year was a HUGE disapointment. We stand in line for almost 30 hours  was among the first but that didnt count for anything when the line broke 30 minutes before 18 on Saturday. The orginisation there was a JOKE and really poorly designed from your side in MANY ways. So i hope you hire someone to design and shape this up for 2014. (If you need me for the job - just give me a shout ). I have some great ideas  and some pint points on where you failed big time with this. I will share them in the mail!,0
The festival has a general email-adress: info@roskilde-festival.dk. Try there :),0

Roskilde Festival 2015 is sold out!  80 000 tickets are now in the hands of a happy bunch of Roskilde-goers. If you didn’t get a ticket  you can sign up on our waiting list*: roskil.de/WaitingList  A limited number of one-day tickets are still available. If you’re interested in tickets for Friday  you should act fast as we have few left.  *When you sign up for our waiting list you will be able to buy a ticket if anybody wants to sell their ticket or if a ticket buyer cancels the purchase. You shouldn't expect a lot of tickets to become available.,389
Some Mondays are tougher than others. But what an incredible pleasure it was to see your lovely faces again. Thank you for making this an amazing festival.,16
It was fuckin amazing but next time i'll stay in J the whole festival. Sure if you enjoy hard drugs  the constant smell of piss and garbage and the occasional rape/ knife fight the other areas are probably a good option too.. Fuck that tho.,0
@Mathias yeah well I could probably handle a few places smelling like piss  but the Roskilde crowd had some weird idea that every vertical surface is a urinal.. People were actually pissing in the back of the bleachers at the orange stage  which ran down on the restaurants behind it.. Mmmmm yummy... That's not the case at every festival. There was actually minor swamps made up of piss and mud in certain areas. The promoters should just go around unannounced and hand out fines for like 1000dkk whenever they find people pissing where they're not supposed to. They would make millions.,0
Don't hate the player hate the game,0
8 days at Roskilde Festival are more peaceful than a weekend in Copenhagen.. And you are at one of the biggest festivals in the world  you really should be expecting the constant smell of piss :p,0
Nah.. But my dignity is pretty much gone..,0
Grecia: Wearing sensible shoes helps. But yeah  body is aching like hell.,0
They would make millions and lose all respect.. And in a few years Northside would be Denmark's big festival... No thanks,0
Actually they should just make more areas like J. Stayed in E this year as always and we were lucky to not have any big soundsystems around the corner.,0
Unfortunately  Chase & Status only permitted live streaming  so we can't offer the concert 'on demand'.,0
Thank you Roskilde festival for an amazing 4 days. Book Queens of the stone age again and let them play a full set next time.,0
Maby you should consider selling these...  ,0
Now only 5 weeks to go......,1

Oh  is that so? Thank you very much :-),0
Hey Roskilde. At the My Bloody Valentine gig in 2008  I noticed the the whole concert was captured on camera. Can those shootings be found somewhere or will they become available someday?,0
And the other live performances that were sent on DR K  too? :),0
thank you very gøb,0
Wasn't the cameramen just around for the bigscreen blowups of the performance?,0
Ohh yeah probably.. But could't those recordings easily be mixed with the recordings of the music and then wupti - a My Bloody Valentine show to be watched over and over.,0
How many tickets are sold  and have many do you have left? /Sweden.,0
We still have tickets left. If you know you want to go you'd better get one before we run out of them.,0

M Y turn to wish for a band. Fatso Jetson  stoner rock legends and founding fathers of the genre along with Kyuss are touring Europe this summer. During the Roskilde weekend  they're visiting Hamburg and Warsaw. They have two dates available. So  dear bookers – will this be the year where we'll see the Lalli brothers take Roskilde? I hope so :-) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B48PFGpsaeI  Would make an amazing addition to the rock roster.,0

Enormous thanks to you all for making Roskilde 2013 such an amazing weekend! So much fantastic music from all over the planet. So many nice people!   Several of the artists I saw this year said that it was an honour to play Roskilde. I know what they mean.    There is nothing in the world quite like it!  Have a great summer!,0
Can you please upload the restreams of the concerts? Or release som HD of the bigger concerts? :D,0

One of bad religion final shows ever.... We were lucky to see,0
I still miss a hardrock/heavy metal headliner for this year.But I guess this year will be a year without that kind of act.Bon iver is famous for what?,0
Weeell  we could do with a metal headliner  I agree on that  but don't hate on Bon Iver. He won two out of the four Grammy Awards he was nominated for this year  so he is bigger than you might think. He will draw a massive crowd  I believe.  And  still  there are four metal/hard rock subheadliners to sink your teeth in: Behemoth  The Cult  Machine Head and Nasum.,0
Bon iver is probably bigger in denmark than in Sweden.just like many other bands.i still miss a major heavy act ,0
Just give us Manowar!,0
Not until a couple of weeks before the festival usually.,0
Here are some fun food facts based on numbers from #rf14.   What's your favorite food at Roskilde Festival? Share it as a comment below and we'll give away 20 food tickets for #rf15 to one lucky foodie.  We'll find the winner on Thursday.,27
All of them  but you can´t go wrong with Spaghetti. Cures the hangover and gives you enough energy to pursue the next one.,0
The amazing pulled pork burger at a place I don't remember the name of...,0
French fries and Burgers,0
I loved all 'breakfast' kinds of food. Like the breakfast pizza with eggs and bacon. Everything with eggs and bacon was great. Ate for 2000+ kr at last Roskilde festival.,0
Gringos nachos!!! they are simply amazing  and will help you recover quickly after a rough night in front of the orange stage!,0
The pizza,0
Nachos All the way,0
Pork Sandwich from Meyers - for sure! Every year I attended,0
Mama's Corner's food! Their chicken burger  their flæskestegs sandwich etc.!,0
Gringo nachos :D,0
Garlic bread and veggie burgers ??,0
MegaPita and the spaghetti <3 :D,0
The vegetarian risotto with lemon olive oil. Or the wonderful  meatballs  that were veggie with lots of good stuff. From the food court.. Love them!!,0
Ski burger - just great when you are hungry,0
Gringo Nachos are a must  no Roskilde without those.,0
what... the fuck,0
A good old cheeseburger and all the fries with mayo! NOMNOMNOM!,0
Burgers were great  also love Nachos an Mexican style!,0
Circus chili fries (y),0
You can never go wrong with French fries,0
Gringo's nachos! Kan varmt anbefales :D,0
The burritos from Flaming Cactus.,0
The bagels!!,0
the  flæskestegssandwich  at meyers is incomparable when the munchies arive at 2am.,0
All Them fries!!!,0
Brazil is underrated. love it.,0
The pulled pork burger at  Brasil  is my favourite from last year. I walked there all the way from B many times only to eat. Great taste and great value!,0
Flaming Cactus  Thai Lanna and Gringos Nachos is my favourite <3,0
This is my first time going to Roskilde  I cannot wait to try ALL the food!,0
Ski burger with cheese,0
That's a lotta mayo :S,0
It' gotta be the Haché Gourmet Burgers surely! Cures any hangover any day :-D,0
Dixie Burger! :D,0
It's gotta be french fries with tomato-paste. And for the stuff you buy at food stalls  it's the greasy hotwings you get when buying gringos nachos.,0
I've never been! But I'm looking forward to taste pretty much everything! especially the famous ski burger  apparently :-) And anything with enourmous amounts of mayo in it!  -) And veggie-foods too. And all the versions of chips  dips  salads  sandwiches  drinks  snacks  candies and beers! uhhh  and nachos  nudels  cakes  fish  desserts and everything else.Oh dear  I won't have any money left when I go home.,0
The wonderful Dixie Burger and Gumbo. Roskilde just isn't complete without them. Gumbo is especially recommended during the rainy days.,0
Dixieburger or the garlicbread you can get in city-center west!,0
Eva Heijkants Jessie Anna Margriet Coster next to alcohol this is the most important part of our (festival) life,0
The Gringo Nachos and the daiquiri! It's the perfect combi.,0
The risotto with peas from Grød in the Food Court ????,0
Gringo Nachos all the way! ??????,0
I'm gonna go for pasta and cookies. And burgers.,0
Ahmm  duhhh? Dixie Burger! ?? p.s.  closing the Pavilion Junior stage and thereby making Dixie only available during the 4 days of music was a very traumatic experience for me last year! #movethedixiestand,0
Paella from  Det Spanske Madhus  - though nothing beats Food-Jamming with awesome People and ingredients - I can proudly say I've learned how to make fish fillets from scratch! That's gotta make up with all the festival prejudgies! :),0
The buggi burger ??,0
Always getting myself a gringos nachos supreme with 4x extra cheese  nine years in a row!,0
The double cheeseburger at west city rf13 is probably hard to beat!,0
Fries fried in duck fat was an absolute favorite for me in 2014. It follows perfectly in the RF diet plan: HCHF - High Carb High Fat,0
If strawberries is concidered food i'd have to say strawberry daiquri from Gringobar,0
The Organic Boho at Foodcourt???? 100% vegan  raw and organic!!,0
A burger from both DixieBurger and Skiburger is a definate tradition for me to enjoy on the grandstand the night before the festival opens  while I watch the light-tech-guys test out the lightsystem at Orange stage??? I don't k ow why  but there is just something about sitting there on the grandstand the night before the music breaks loose  and give yourself a moment of calm and quiet reflection of the year which has passed and the year to come??? yeah!!!*big & happy sigh*???\M/,0
I dig on Dixies... Only at Roskilde!!,0
Pulled pork burger from Brazil  Red Curry Chicken from Thai Lanna and Flæskestegssandwich from Meyers ????????????,0
NEED MORE VEGAN AND ORGANIC FOOD ??,0
Last year on the way home from a partu i West  i picked up an Stew  i think it was irish  i don't know the name off the stand  but it was located in citycenter west  nearest to the bridge. I don't know if it was because I was drunk  but I remember the Stew as one of the greatest meals I ever had  sure it came very conviniet at that time  but I just remeber the great taste. I step by to times more  to get the same experience  but I was too late every time  they were closed. So I sincerely hope they will be at Festival this year again  and that I'll manage to step by in time. See you!!,0
Definitely Spaghetti!!! Could eat them 3 times a day! :) <3,0
Lamb risotto from Rock'n'Risotto! I want that recipe!,0
Mama Mobasa's vegetarian pancaces for the win!,0
skraldenachos (y),0
Luxus svin from Skiburger <3 I dream of it all year! ??,0
Everything looks so delicious! I haven't been before but I can't wait to try the food :D,0
Oxburger and Dixieburger - one of each every day! Or two of the same... Now I'm just hungry...,0
Ski burger :D,0
Always a lot of tasty food at  Roskilde. But the pytt-i-panna at the Swedish kitchen is a favourite :-),0
The winner is: Pasta!,0
I don't know yet  my first time at rf. But I think I will consume my part of the fries ?? ??,0
Dixie Burger :D,0
Gumbo-soup. Perfect on a cold night.,0
Always looking for something New. But me and some Guys have a tradition. We have to get spicy toast  with A glass of limonade :-D,0
Pork burger and coffee,0
crayfish tail sandwich from BUSBUS,0
I will never forget the Louisiana burger in 1995  1996...,0
It's always exciting to explore the huge variety of food at Roskllde Festival. But some golden classics are def. the chili meatballs with roasted potatoes and tzaziki (chilifrikadeller med brasede kartofler og tzaziki) in camping area G  Meyer's Pork Roast Sandwich (flæskestegssandwich)  and Christiania Falaffel  Yummy!!,0
How is this even a question? Dixie Burger beats anything  hands down. In fact  I'd go so far as to say that I'm looking forward to another one of these slices of spicy heaven almost as much as I am Muse!  It's a good thing I don't actually have access to food like that as fast-food on an everyday basis  'cause I'd be having a hard time arguing against that whenever I was even slightly hungover... or hungry... or nearby.,0
The wrap from Flaming Cactus is amazing.,0
More vegan food  thank you. It's not funny  that you have to kill so many animals. Please  more vegan and organic food ??????,0
Tai Lana is without a doubt the best food on the entire festival!,0
Mumbai is delicious and you always feel full after you have one of thier meals  and its spicy and warm so it's also pretty good comfort food for those windy and rainy days. But the main favorite is the gourmet portobello burger - oh my <3,0
The Vietnamese Pho soup and the Dijon mustard sausage at the food court last year was to die for! Also the cold brewed coffee found at the food court was amazing.  The food court is one of the best add ons to the festival!,0
A bunch of different things  though what I recall being the most satisfying is probably the roast-burger and chips w. mayonnaise you can get at Kristinedal across from Arena.,0
Breakfast Burger by the lake! Every Day starts With that perfect combo ??,0
Its definitely Dixie burgers!! Omg  they are so delicious ?????? can't wait to get one again  now I have waited for a whole year!,0
Diners fries and chicken was and is the BEST ??????,0
The garlic bread. Oh  the garlic bread.,0
The Lamb Risotto from Rock'n'Risotto ... wasn't there in rf14 .. so i guess last year the favorite was the Swindler-burger :),0
Dixie burgers are awesome :-D,0
Vegetarian foooood! :D <3,0
Meyer's flæskestegssandwich!!!,0
Gringos Nachos!!! :D :D,0
Kalkonkorv with mashed potatoes from The Swedish Kitchen ????,0
The red curry dish from thai-lanna!,0

Andreas Hagedorn Nielsen  this is a photo of the Volbeat concert.,0
Volbeat and CphCph :),0
Did Kraftwerk already begin?,0
We didn't get permission to live stream Kraftwerk.,0
Now that Björk most likely won't play  maybe you should book Sigur Rós? They have a new album 28th of may and are available during Roskilde. ,0

Roll on #RF14,0
Yes yesterday around 14:30. Is terrible trafic very heavy   From Roskilde to Køge,0
The police creat more more more inpact in the trafic,0
The trafic is long distance 4 km,0
Why was securety so lax with bottles n such this year? I liked the planning with Apollo just below pavillion making the festival area more integrated with the camping  although it sucked people from the camps own party's imo. And where was our blue-shirt can gatherer  not every one likes to spit and piss on the lowest members in society. If my last 7 years at roskilde was an 8  this year was a 4.  Thank you all for this year and sorry for some rant. Greetings,0
To bad that you shutted emidiatly  down the queens of stone age stream! :( ,0
Our website could'nt manage the huge interest that Queens of the Stone Age generated. We are sorry for the shutdown...,0
give me the live stream from :THE BLUE ANGEL LOUNGE  the best Band ever! ! !,0
What happend to the queens of stone age live stream? my browser crash when i was looking on the stream on the orange channel  and now when i solved the problem it is a repotage why? how to come? ,0

Get ready to spoil your taste buds!  At #rf15 there'll be food to satisfy your every need. This year we'll roll in ten food trucks at the area around Street City - and Food Court will once again host many new food stall talents.  Read more right here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2015/food-that-makes-sense,18
Bibiche Klaasse rollende keukens  all over again^^ krekels eten  ??,0
Will it be possible to find a LCHF food stand there?,0
Food Court isn't too bad. Most of it is high-quality food  and you get more food for your money than in most of the stalls with typical festival food. I highly recommend going there!,0
Hi Rikke. You won't be able to find a stall that is focused on selling LCHF food only. However  the range of food is quite broad  so you'll most definitely be able to find alternatives that comply with the LCHF principles :),0
Does your camp have what it takes to become Camp of the Year?  Camp of the Year is for all the camps that can create a fantastic atmosphere  togetherness and love with creative  innovative and festive experiences.

We are sorry for the shotdown  but when a band with two million followers link to the streaming of their concert  it's a bit of a task for a website - even Roskilde Festivals website - to handle,0
Of course. But heck some bad timing!,0
You had enough? Get the direct train from the festival site to • Copenhagen H - every half hour with last departure at 01:48 • Aarhus H 02.02 and 02:45 • Frederikshavn 04:25,2
No odense?,0
Take the last train to copenhagen....  -)),0
At the ticketstand they said  trains didn't leave to Copenhagen untill after 23 :/,0
No. Sorry Nicolaj Bo Pasfall,0
Hey guys do You know where we can find 3D glasses for Kraftwerk tonight?,0
It is by the sails way back from the Orange stage,0
It's going down in less than half an hour! Queens of the Stone Age live from The Orange Stage,11
Will this be re-streamed at some point? Perhaps uploaded to youtube?,0
The page is going down in 10 minutes.. :(,0
Live stream & site is down :(,0
We know about the site and are doing everything to get it up and running as fast as possible!,0
Blow  cache doesn't work for me. Please please upload it slat some point,0
Would have loved to be there!,0
Thank you so much roskilde 4 streaming this concert live hope to be there 2014 again ,0
arhhh... some minutes before the end the page crashed completely .. until that QotSA was absolutely fucking great!,0
It's tough on any old festivalwebsite when an american rockband with 2 million followers put up a link up to the festival that's streaming their show. We're doing everything we can to get the website up and running again,0
just almost made it to the end of QOTSA before the stream gave in.,0
Understandable. We appreciate your effort and the live stream!,0
Are they done?,0
What happend to the stream? Mine crasch and now when i reload it is a repotage! why?,0
Can you please restream this ?,0
How come they only played like 70 minutes?,0
Can't say at this point. You can stay updated here http://roskilde-festival.tv/videos?album_id=7962531 7962679 7962738 7962942,0
Bless you,0
No  probably not  Wes Chella. If we get the clearence  though  we will stream Kraftwerk,0
hehe .. can imagine .. great job anyway.. thanks for the streamings !,0
Because it's a festival!,0
Yeah but a headliner? Compared to Slipknot and Metallica  they seemed to rush through the show a bit :/,0
It's their style. They've rarely played for more than 75 minutes at Roskilde. Foo Fighters did practically the same in 2005  the same with Them Crooked Vultures in 2010.,0
Karma Police  remember you can turn in your beerstained sleepingback or the dusty sleeping mat next to the towers and by all the exist. We'll clean it and and then donate it to charity,19
Awesome idea! Roskilde has always had a healthy charity tradition. But next time you need top dollar translations send them to me and I'll sort them out for you :-) keep up the great work!,0
When do we get to hear Karma Police on Orange Stage? :),0
I have a question! I have been woking at the festival this week so i have a green bracelet. I've heard from someone  that at the end of the festival you can trade it for a real bracelet. Is that true?,0
Help us hand out 60.000 3D glasses for the Kraftwerk concert. Join us here at 20:00 and you will receive hugs and good karma,18
And this is also where you get the glasses?,0
It should be possible for you to stream  Dennis. Karpe Diem is streaming right now at Arena,0
Roskilde Festival is also More Than Music Camp life  arts  graffiti  cinema  skating  games and much more.  Take an action packed tour with Orange TV,9
Here is some footy from the Metallica concert @ Roskilde Festival,0
In about half an hour  James Blake is gonna arrive at Roskilde Festivals Orange Stage  and you can stream the whole thing right here - enjoy!,8
We have drunk the  Orange Feeling !!,0
You  have had the nices weather. So rry I cutten be there.Well its clocing time see you next  year...,0
Hi Roskilde - Am I right  that buying a ticket with entrance at East 1 is not possible any more? :) Have a good day -  45 days! ,0
Andreas  let's just say that East 1 is a very popular entrance. And thanks for posting in English  btw - we have lots of people from abroad so we prefer a language that everyone understands.,0
why is it the most popular? does it matter which one you pick? me and my friends booked this one (east 1).. no idea why  we just picked the first one on the list haha,0
@Roskilde - Will there be opened up for more bookings at East 1  later on?:) - you're welcome ! @Alda - East 1 is In my opinion the one entrance who gives you the best/fastest access to the camping areas  closest to the festival grounds :) ,0
 This is f***ing awesome   Although it's super catchy  it's not easy to sing along to  Thrift Shop . These festivalgoers did their best though.  Think you can do better? Then join the crowd tonight at 21.30,5
the one with the cucumber is the best :D ahahahah :P,0
Thomas :D,0
Is it possible to pre-order a tent and pick it up at a stand this year as well?,0
No  it will not be possible to pre-order a tent  but you will be able to buy a tent at the Spejdersport stand.,0
Säljer två 8 dagars biljetter till Roskilde  skriv i PM för mer info!   Selling two 8 days ticket for Roskilde  message me for more information!,0

Roskilde Festival encourages car sharing. Not only is it better for the environment  it's also a great social experience...and it'll save you some money as well!

If you use this offer you'll also be competing for a special Roskilde Festival edition Volkswagen for a full year. Find more info and your ride on www.upride.dk,13

We have a change in programme today:  The Martinez Brothers were supposed to play together with Seth Troxler tonight on the Apollo Stage. Unfortunately  The Martinez Brothers won’t be able to make it to Roskilde Festival due to travel and visa issues.  The good news is that we still have Seth Troxler on board. He will play a dance-inducing set on Apollo at 2:30. More good news is that we have added English post-dubstep artist Ital Tek to the line-up. He will play at 19:00  taking Recondite’s slot. Recondite will play at 1:00. A fully updated schedule is available in our app and on our website.,0

Internet sensations! Social media platforms have had a huge influence on artists and their rise towards stardom. A lot of them have started their career making music at home but have grown to huge artists with international careers through channels like Soundcloud  YouTube  Beatport and Facebook. This is an exciting tendency – and every year we keep a close eye on new and exciting talents. We also have a batch of these internet sensations in our 2015 line-up. Check ‘em out: http://roskil.de/InternetSensations And check out all of our Spotify-playlist in the app.,1

NOTHING! Because the lineup sucks so much that I sold my ticket. The first time since 93 I don't go. I am not getting old  will go to a few other festivals this year. But this lineup is just a big disappointment.,0
Greased up deaf guy.,0
Anyone knows how it's going with the sale for this year?,0
According to RF the ticketsale is at about the same level as last year (when they sold out). They never reveal actual salesnumbers.,0
Roskilde  apparently i´ve got a problem  please help me here - I ordered my ticket with entrance booking to  east 2  because i thought it was the same entrance as I used last year. Last year it was called  entrance 2  - Then I checked the map and realised last years entrance 2 today is called  East 1 . Are there any chance I can change my entrancebooking from East 2 to East 1?  Thank you in advance :) ,0
Want to buy a ticket for the entire week or saturday  please message me if interested ??????,0
Hi guys your toilets stinks they are in a very bad condition,0
Stolen tent  need place for sleep. Can help with entrance.,0
Are we going to see a complete (or at least somewhat complete) version of the map any time soon? The preliminary map is all but useless when trying to figure out where to set up camp. Thank you.,0
hey this is the place I( Rapasa) would like to play my music...have had Nyatiti and Adung' from Africa on this stage? Ethnical vocals.. ,0
Rise and shine. Adventure awaits.,12

God damn it  Kimmie & Roskilde  why you gotta make this harder for me?,0
 Unfortunately ? This is the best news ever! Finally a really good band for this years lineup!,0

Damn shame about Antemasque (as one could expect from Cedric and Omar...)  but really great replacement you've got there!,0
Did they run out of paint?,0
Is Bob Hund nice? I have never heard them. People say they are an insane live-band. Any songs i should listen to?,0

So glad you had the full on Rihanna experience and that she was every minute and hour worth of wait  Emma. But no  the concert is not available  though. Sorry,0
No unfortunately not  Jona,0
No Marc  it is not ours. It could very well be one of the sky-photographers. Try and tune it out with some good music,0
Rihanna is euphoric about Roskilde Festival today and it seems as though the feelings are mutual,1

Find it strange that you are obligated to buy clothes every month...,0
Will you guys send it all the way to Australia? ,0
Mads E.B. Madsen  no one's obligated. It's just an offer.  Patrick Fagan  yes  we'll ship it anywhere (well  almost).,0
I know that  ) I was just referring to the question how much you use a month on clothes :),0
I interpreted that question as a matter of averages. If I estimated that I spend 4 000 DKK a year on clothes  I'd put 4 000/12 = 333(.33) DKK per month.,0
And what does that have to do with anything?? Please enlighten me.,0

Dear #rf16  can we talk about what just happened? All we wanted was a kiss  and now we're pregnant! #khunnarinselectricphinband,0
Cedric of Antemasque has confirmed that they have cancelled their European Tour...  Bummer ! ?? ,0
Truly a shame  I was really looking forward to see the two of them rocking together again. Hopefully  Roskilde has something big (within the genre) up their sleeves. But perhaps an official statement from the festival itself would be appropriate?,0
Menneskebiblioteket (the Human Library) started at Roskilde Festival in 2000 - now they are returning to celebrate their 15-year anniversary.  The Human Library focuses on prejudice  stigmatizing and discrimination and you can borrow a person who will hopefully expand your horizon. The ‘books’ in this library represent different convictions  lifestyles  handicaps  social statuses  sexualities  occupations or ethnic origins. The Human library will bring approximately 40 ‘books’ which you can borrow for 30-45 minutes.,9
Ha ha ! Sounds like a good idea ! And fun ! I`ll take the second book from the left !,0
This is one of the few things i will never forget  this idea is so fucking awesome. Big up,0
Is it possible to use a RF Gift Card to buy your beer vouchers? If yes  when will you release them?,0

Why have I read something else then?,0

Paul McCartney will be good to close the orange stage but he is playing 2 shows in Horsens Denmark on June 30 and july 1,0
We've asked and the word from Björk's people is that they expect her to be ready for Roskilde 2012.,0
You should ask Paul anyway... nice change for him to perform to younger audience as usual in his concerts... he would love that!,0

Any new names coming up any time soon...? Your spokeswoman said in an interview that you still have about 15 spots to fill..? :o),0
We hope to announce some more next week. No promises  though.,0
Fingers crossed for new and exciting names! :o),0
Remember to post a teaser the day before :),0
Ukrainian rockers THE BAJIKANS!!! ,0
The Dutch artist Robbert van der Horst and Spanish/Icelandic artist Marcos Zotes met over a glass of wine during the construction of Art Zone in 2014. They decided that they wanted to work together and at #RF15 they have created the overall design of Art Zone. This is a sketch of the ideas they are working on  however the final design might change – only time will tell!,1
Get Slayer! If you can fulfill their demands that is?,0
They're booked for Copenhell  so they probably won't show. Their rider is legendary though :),0
I know  a shame though. I'd like to see where you'd get your hands on Hand Satanizer though :P,0
It has been blown out of proportion. It was a simple misunderstanding between the security guard and the band member from Slipknot and no one was harmed. The band and the crew even had a chat after the show and there were good vibes and no hard feelings.,0
The easiest way to get an overview of the food offered at the festival is to use the APPetizer app. Find it in your nearest app store,0
Is There Live Stream For Metallica Answer Me Plz ,0
The live stream schedule is published on the day of the broadcasts. Please check our website tomorrow for updates,0
It is running smooth in our end. What seems to be the issue?,0
According to Bjørks own website  she expects to perform at Roskilde: http://bjork.com/#/news/somefestivalcancellations..,0
You might aswell have Killing Joke back again this year because the new album is so great and the last show at Roskilde was the best gig last year!,0
Back in March we announced a remix competition for Norwegian band 120 Days' song  Sunkissed .   And they have selected a winner! It's Copenhagen based trio Glass House Failure's 24 year old beatmaker/producer Banders Duckpow from Denmark.   You can check out the winning contribution here: ,2
Roskilde! Will you have those metalbars this year too? The ones that were placed in the festival area  orange ones  which you could use to workout on or whatever.,0
Welcome to Art Zone! In Art Zone you will be visually surprised and challenged. We will present you with architecture  performance art  social interventions and sculptures.  The theme for Art Zone this year is “the meeting” – a theme that encapsulates Roskilde Festival. At Roskilde Festival you meet people  opinions  music and new impressions.,6
In addition to not supporting the app on windows phone this year you have managed to create a new web site where the schedule is not working on windows phone. Couldn't you please get that fixed.,0
We want to print a limited edition poster of the amazing graffiti piece  but we need your help to decide which one to go with.

Will you be selling beer-vouchers this year too?,0
Here's a status on our add-on offers. Sleep-in buses just sold out  and we're down to few caravan tickets.  And the full festival ticket is selling fast - get it before it's too late: roskil.de/rf15ticket,29
One day-tickets for Friday are now sold out. There are still a few tickets left for Sunday,10
Are there tickets available for children 10-14 for tonight? :-),0
Thxs a million! :-*,0
Are there any fullweektickets left at the counter of the festival?,0
On Billetlugen and the official Roskilde site  there is nothing about few tickets for Sunday left! I think you have started a rumor.,0
What about saturday? Any left?,0
Ok next year then..,0
The tickets for children cannot be sold out. Remember that children must be assisted by an adult at the festival. Please feel free to let us know if you have any further questions,0
The full festival tickets are still available. You can find more info about tickets here http://roskilde-festival.dk/ticket/ticket_types/,0
Hi Nina. Nop  sorry. Saturday tickets are sold out already.,0
The best way to check it is at the check-in in East  West and the Roskilde Festival train station in West. If you want to make sure the ticket is valid before you go  you can contact Billetlugen. They will be able to tell you whether the ticketnumber is valid,0
We don't have any official pictures  but luckily the band shared the orange feeling on instagram http://statigr.am/p/491303901709464723_23062556,0

Hello! I am so sorry that I am posting my contribution for the Weekly Challenge here  but the site wont allow me to upload there! But here is my idea :) Here the people can say something nice to the rest of the people on Roskilde Festival through a gigantic mouth with a speaker inside of it  and with a speech ballon that says  Say Something Nice . I've made some small descriptions on the drawing to elaborate the details on the rostrum. I just found out about this wonderful creative weekly challenge  and I just made it in last minute  so this is definitely a work-in-progress project  where a lot more details can be added if needed!,0
Such a great idea!!!,0
okay now i've actually send a mail as well...,0
Anyone want to trade an east 2 or south ticket to a west ticket?,0
Todays edition of Orange Press is here!   Read it online http://issuu.com/roskilde-festival/docs/orange_press_rf2013_05-07-2013  Or download the PDF http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2013/presse/Dokumenter/orangepress/Orange_Press_RF2013_05-07-2013.pdf,0
We do our best to match the artists with a stage that can create a great atmosphere. However the demand to see a show can sometimes be overwhelming and hard to predict. We hope you enjoyed the show despite the big turnout and we wish you a good festival!,0
We are aware that there has been a lack of communication about the price difference for pre-sale versus buying a ticket at the entrance. We apologize for this and will take your feedback into consideration for the festivals to come.,0
Still not going to help the one's who spend a fortune for half a day. Makes no sense. Very upsetting and indecent.,0
Baran Yildirim  the prices have always differed between pre-sale and sale 'at the entrance'. Still  with the increased price it's just about 50 DKK per concert  which isn't expensive compared to regular venues.,0
Hi Thomas  unfortunately we have not been able to get permission to use the Slipknot live recordings to share on demand.,0
What about Marie Key?,0
An Israeli artist that affects your consciousness  urban activists from Berlin  a sign-maker and a guy  famous for his flash mobs are just some of the ingredients in this year's ambitious ‘More Than Music’ programme.  Stay tuned every Tuesday from now on - there's more to come!,4
I have a problem with my entrance booking  I think the problem might be that I bought my two tickets in August last year. Do you have any solution for that?,0
Do you know anything about the East Entrance 1 is sold out? Or is it Billetlugen i should contact?.. I can't order a normal ticket to that entrance at the moment.. Weird.. Thanks a lot!,0

Generally  look in the places farthest from the stages. Should be space in N  P  J or K. If you just have one smallish tent  ask people to move a little. You should be able to squeeze in many places.,0
Hi Christian  so far we unfortunately have no permission from Slipknot to broadcast the show. If that changes we can assure you that we will let you know! Until then keep an eye on our homepage: http://roskilde-festival.dk/,0

Btw  good job with the program this year. I cant be there with all my friends because of work. I'll return from my two year absens next year. It sucks The Dillinger Escape Plan miss their summer Tour. RF's should have had the opportunity to see that amazing band destroy Odeon Stage,0

Well... 80 000 ticket buyers disagree with you.,0
Øv øv! Næste år piger :-D,0
Roskilde Festival how many tickets are released in total? 90 000?,0
No  they don't  they are going for the experience and u guys know it. Im going  btw  already paid for it  as usual  but if u look around no festivals are headlining Paul McCartney as main attraction. Knowing festivals shouldnt be the same  Roskilde should tap them all with much more  2015  acts! With all respect  hes music is excellent and no one can doubt about hes music contribution  but we are mostly between our early 20's  late 30's... in a attempt generalization here  we normally dont go camping for him... My parents would do  for sure. And ive mentioned before: the lack of women on stage is getting old already. With all brilhant choices going around this days u guys really pick Nick Minaj. Yep.,0
Most festivals in the world is envy on Roskilde  for the fact that Roskilde have McCartney and they dont,0
If they are  going for the experience  I look forward to lots of space in front of the stages. I'm more inclined to believe that you're wrong though.  Also  the headliners are hardly where the  2015  action's at  since being billed in that size requires you to have been around for some time. If you want bleeding-edge  go for the smaller names. I must say  though  that I think that Florence + the Machine  Disclosure and Kendrick Lamar provide ample counterweight against the dinosaurs with the same size billing.  tl dr: Fuck the headliners.,0
I might be  lets hope for it.looking at the festival goers and the money spend  Sir. McCartney brings return from the old folks. Also  theres no need of others festivals been jealous: Chachella  Rock in Rio  Loola  all them have the ex beatle as atraction. Theres no change on hes playlist  no surprises. I probably have much to still learn about the industry  but Ive see him 4 times.,0
U could insert Hes face there... hehehe  but jokes aside  more acts  please.,0
Each year people complain about the acts and each year new people tend to gorget it's so little about the acts and that is more about the orange feeling. It's not the big bands that matters it's more the band you wouldn't have discovered before.,0
Neither Coachella or Rock in Rio have Paul McCartney. Only Lollapalooza have him too (billed as a headliner – the main attraction). The former two on the other hand can brag of such current and fresh headliners as No Doubt  Metallica (Rock in Rio USA)  Queen  Rod Stewart (Rock in Rio Brazil) and AC/DC (Coachella).  Old stale farts  the lot :-),0
He was at 2004 in RiR  may 29  and in 2009 april 17 for Coachella.,0
Eduardo  thats exactly what I mentioned about the experience! Its a very though job to keep it up a light on such a fired up festival like this. I mean  last year had a few disappointments ( Im BIG fan on Arctic M.  but they are not so good at stage anymore )  but was one of a kind! How to top that? And how to forget 2013  when they announced Mettalica last day of May? Its very eclectic  but theres much more to see around today. An example: Tove Lo is a good pop artist  from here next to us  Sweden  starting to be around everywhere  but not here.( no comparison about how good or big they are  just about opportunities ),0
juhuuuu :D !,0
If you're hoping for more acts  I can shoot that one down  unfortunately. There won't be any more announcements except for a handful of smallish urban names for the Street City stage  and  unless of course  lighting strikes  and someone cancels. The programme is complete.,0
:O :O :O,0
Me too haha.. fedt man!!,0
Don't tell me what to do,0

WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT. Die Fucking Antwoord is coming. That's the only thing I needed to see hit the list before buying a ticket,0
So you'd prefer Nicki Minaj over Paul McCartney? Are you trying to be funny or are you just fucking nuts?,0
I don't think u interpretated right  Philip. I was been sarcastic about the booty lady.,0
It's been downhill since my first time (But i'm still going for the orange feeling every year =),0

Official information on ticket prices can be found here.  If you wanna buy a ticket on the day  you can only buy it at the entrances and not online.  Please note that the price for one-day tickets is higher when you buy them at the entrance.,3
If you're showing up tomorrow where you I head to find a camping spot? Or is it all full?,0
OMG does that mean that you raised the price from 650 to 1100  without informing people about the stop of the onlinesale .... This is not the Roskilde I used to know!!!,0
Please stay safe out there. Only use the official swimming lake where the life guards and your fellow fetivalgoers can watch out for you. Swimming in the other lakes could be dangerous. Have fun in the sun. Photo: Ole Haug,6

Can you also buy full festival tickets at the entrances?,0
Just been at the entrance and they say that the ticket for today cost 1100kr and not 670kr as advetised here?,0
We're very sorry but there has been a mistake in our internal communication. The DKK 650 price is only pre-sale. At the entrance the price for one-day-tickets for Thursday tickets is DKK 1100.,0
What?!? Why has this not been advertised anywhere?,0
For some this has been an expensive misstake  fake advertising is illegal in denmark. Allready cost me 120kr,0
We're very sorry about the error we made earlier regarding the price for one-day-tickets for Thursday. We had the wrong information at the time. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.,0
You can buy tickets at the entrances non-stop.,0
Is it possible to buy a one day ticket today (thursday)? Cannot find information about that anywhere. Except this on the ticket type page:  One-day tickets are only offered for the concert days 4 July – 7 July 2013.   So I still have hope. But where do I buy them?,0
It sure is. You can buy them at the festival entrance.,0
There is no fee when using the BigEwallet. There is a 70 øre fee when depositing less than 500 - kr. Depositing more than 500 - kr is free.,0
We sorry that you have not been properly informed about the fee.,0
What's the weather like at the moment and what's the forecast for the next 4 days?,0
Thanks! I just never trust these sites and wanted to hear it from someone who's already there.,0

Freddie Gibbs isn’t able to play Roskilde Festival.  Stepping up and taking his place in the line-up is American-Peruvian rapper Immortal Technique. Armed with simple beats and an indignant voice  the rapper attacks political and economical imperialism that causes social inequality. Music as a voice of dissent is the immortal technique  which we’ll soon experience at Roskilde Festival 2016.,22
Nice replacement (y) Last time I saw him at Roskilde was truly memorable,0

Hi Mark. We are sorry for the inconvenience. It is the first year that Roskilde Festival is in charge of the camp and we will take all your feedback into consideration for next year’s festival. However  we know this doesn't help your current situation. Our best suggesting is to do it in good company. Your can find the nearest entrance here http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2013/map/Kort_indgangsbooking_1505-2013.pdf,0
Hi Roskilde. Thanks for the map. The reason why I was confused is the information from when we bought the ticket. Quote:  We ask you to go directly to the Get A Tent Uptown camp site which opens on Wednesday 3 June at 12:00. It will be possible to exchange your festival ticket to a wristband at check-in.  Looking forward to a great festival with lovely people :-),0

Awesome! Incidentally  if I happen to sleep over and wake up after my ticket expired (IE 8 AM saturday)  is there a penalty  even if it was unintentional?,0
The one day ticket is valid from 05:00 until 05:00 the next morning. There is a 3.500 DKK fine for being at the festival without a valid ticket  so it might be a good idea to set an alarm in case you plan to nap,0
Hi Kristina. Yes  it is.  You can buy you ticket at the East and West entrance. However  if you have a smart phone you can also show your ticket on that. We look forward to see you.,0
We're looking forward  that's for sure.  What do you think about his new album?,7

Dear Roskilde  I hear some (hopefully false) roomers that GAT Uptown customers cannot get their Roskilde bracelet at the entrance to GAT Uptown? This has been the routine as long as H&M was in control so I would assume this is still the case? If you for some reason has chosen to discontinue this service which entrance should we use and how far do we need to walk from there to get to GAT? Thanks,0
I don't know if you can get your wristbands at the GAT Uptown entrance  but in case you can't  the closest entrance is Entrance Platform. Take the train from Roskilde to the festival and get your wristband on there :),0
You must be kidding Thanks for nothing Roskilde #letshaveh&mbackplease,0
But why this decrease in service? The GAT Uptown tickets are the most expensive of all and just as expensive as last year's H&M Reboot tickets.,0
Hi Julie Christina Grew .We totally understand your point of view. It is the first year that Roskilde Festival is in charge of the camp and we will take all your feedback into consideration for next year’s festival . We are sorry for the inconvenience. Have a great festival.,0

I love how you used  Reach for the Dead  from Boards of Canada's new album. In a recent interview they opened up for actually doing gigs. Did you try this year or have you tried in the past to book them for Roskilde?,0
Malte Hauberg Holgaard  it's a camera put up in a 32 metres high radio mast near Arena. From here you can see concerts from Apollo  Arena and Orange (maybe a bit from Pavilion as well).  Later you'll be able to see LOADS of stuff going on - from when we open the gates to the festival site.,0

Hey Rikke. You need to have a wristband to enter GAT Uptown as the camping area is an add-on for those who al ready have their Roskilde Festival 2013 wristbands. If you have your friends' vouchers it is possible to check in for others - but the limit is three tents per person. We wish you a great festival,0
see you in 8 hours!,0
See you soon,0
Buy daily or full ticket. Pm,0

Welcome to Street City! This year Game City will be a part of Street City. Street City will not only be cool skating  blading and dance events and upcoming urban artists and DJs throwing crazy parties in the night time - you will also be able to take part in street games such as volleyball and football.,15
Will the Red Bull scene be there like last year (the one with KIDD and Nonsens playing)? If so  do you have a schedule/list of the acts playing?,0
No basketball court? :(,0
Lucas Daniel Zuleta say What!!!,0
Will you fix the skatepark for this year? It is pretty wrecked and dangerous..   And furthermore  are you planning on building anything skate related  where the Vert Ramp you took down last year (without building anything new) were?  Best Regards  Anders :-),0
Wating for it ! ??,0
Hi Mathias. The stage is called Street City Stage and the line-up will be announced shortly.,0
I know where i will stay at !,0
Sounds good ? Can't wait ???????????? Ros is gonna be great,0
That sounds more dangerous.,0
Can't wait!,0
If your wristband is about to break  go to the entrances immediately. They can help you.,0
Thanks a lot,0
Hey people! We are students from Roskilde University doing a project on Roskilde Festival and we'd love your help in filling up our survey - http://www.survey-xact.dk/LinkCollector?key=N5SZKACXCK16  Thanks guys!  ),0
Roskilde sucks this year  its so sad...I really hope next years lineup will be better cuz I love the place and the atmosphere  but that alone dont cover up the fact that the lineup sucks,0
What do you miss from it?,0
Check it out!,10
Which parts of the app will be offline-enabled? ... Since I'm pretty sure the network will be mostly inaccessible  it would be pretty neat if it DIDN'T require network connection for at least the schedule and map bits...,0
read a article today that Roskile is bluetooth enabling the entire festival site for news distribution to smartphones and also for user-to-user communication. Seems that could solve the need for carrier support at least for local activities,0
Hahahha I love the beer-counter!,0
At least make it universal.. It looks like the leg of a burn victim on anything just a tiny bit bigger than a phone.. Edgy and completely unreadable,0
Nezar  it will be 95% offline.,0
Emil  we are testing bluetooth technology  it will not drain you battery and you disable it. It's under development/testing  more on this later.,0
Jimmy  our focus has been on creating a cool app for two platforms (Iphone and Android)  instead of a mediocre app for various platforms.,0
Why keep people ignoring WP? I really don't get it. WP is a serious player on the market now  which means organisations and developers should not only focus on iOS and Android  but also WP.,0
The Bert counter may be à cool idea. But when I am listening to spotify the app pauses it just enable the beer sound when I am refreshing à page. Please remove the sound or put it somewhere where it dosent start whenever you refresh à page. / iPhone 4 user,0
@Viktor: we are not actively ignoring WP. But with less than 0 5% WP phones on the festival  it's still a question on priorities vs. Budget. But yes  it does seem as they are on the rise,0
@Eduardo: will look into if there are some app to app interference. Thanks for the update.,0
Any change for a iPad version too ? Should not be that hard to port over.,0
Looking for a one-day ticket for Saturday. Anyone selling one? ??,0
Thursday is sold out!  Wednesday will also sell out soon.,6

Looks great. Use our official hashtags #rf13 and #rf13arts so we and our festival goers can follow the work.,0
You and the festival goers could also use #rfgraff when its about graffiti  ),0
Looking forward to get in to the festival saturday for Metallica! First time at Roskilde Festival too! :D \m/,0

Will there be a place to see the euro matches? I am Belgian and wanna watch the game on Friday! Thanks,0
No  unfortunately not. We don't have permission to show the games. Have a great festival! :-),0
There isn't  unless you can find a camp of Belgians or Welshmen who are streaming it on the fly. The festival hasn't the rights to show the matches as they are very costly.,0
Thanks for the quick reply! Does anyone know if there is a bar in the neighborhood that does show them?,0
Wish to buy dayly or full tickets. Make offer prv mess.,0
I have no pm,0

Hi Anders. Unfortunately we don't have an app for Windows Phone this year.,0
Dear festival - this is a very bad decision! With all the possibillities for cross-platform development it should not be that hard to supply the app for Windows Phone as well.,0
Hi RF! Last years treasure hunt at Prags Have was really fun. Is there going to be another event like that this year? :),0
Iron Maiden to tour next year. Let s get them for 2015. Will be awesome to have also Black Sabbath :),0
 There's a difference in believing in something and standing for something   - Edward Snowden   The Rising City was covered in people who came to listen to Edward Snowden who spoke about digital privacy and data surveillance #RF16,30
Thanks for the event Roskilde  it was great. #pardonsnowden,0
Thanks for trusting us Yes Men to do this  Roskilde! We appreciate it. And Ed had an awesome time as well.,0
Did Edward Snowden know that the festival practices the same data surveillance as governments and industry? And that their excuse the other day was that  everybody is doing it ? Maybe you should have shown him the data disclaimer that I've seen in the previous days. :)) cc Martin Moen Wulffeld   details: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153817008790914&set=o.10248811705,0
Looking for a sikent and clean ticket and a parking ticket,0
Silen & Clean tickets are useless now. Those were exclusively for coming before Saturday evening at 00.00 where the area was opened up for everyone. Now you just show up and see if there's space or not – there's no way left to  buy  yourself into S&C.   Parking tickets can be bought on site unless they're sold out.,0
Tomorrow we'll find this week's quiz winners - and you still have a chance to become part of that bunch of lucky souls!   So quiz your way through the line-up for your chance to win freakin' awesome prizes right now.,3
Dear Lisbet  Thanks for your comment. We are thoroughly looking into the unfortunate statements and our Tolerance Team is working to solve the situation. When we know more on the situation we will let you know. Roskilde Festival strives to make the festival-experience safe for everyone and it is important to stress that we urge people to respect each other and take care of each other.,0
We do our outmost to make Roskilde Festival a great experience in safe surroundings for all. It is essential that our festival guests as well as volunteers contribute to this. Today  this mutal respect has been challenged and we have done everything to get to the bottom of this. In situations like this one we make sure to talk to our volunteers and inform them about what is acceptable behaviour and what's not  as a standard procedure. The volunteer in question  as well as Roskilde Festival  never meant to harass or be disrespectful to anyone. Unfortunately  a different conclusion has been drawn from the article. As a result hereof  the involved person has been given a warning. But in terms of comment about the  volunteer's position as a security guard at Apollo is NOT true. As a matter of fact  the volunteer doesn't work as a safety guard at any of the stages.  We hope that you will all have a great festival and remember to take care of each other and spread the orange feeling.,0

If you are working as a volunteer  you need to come by Teknisk Skole which is on Pulsen. But as a guest you can buy tickets everyday  24/7 at all the entrance. So whenever you feel like it,0
Sorry  no Nephew this year. But if you're into family-related names check out: Mother Lewinsky or Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats.,0

An Auditory Gating-blog post on this years Roskilde Festival with Spotify playlists to prepare you for all the great music :)  ,0
We're doing another sing-along session at #rf15. What songs should be included in 'The Roskilde Songbook'? We are looking for classic songs filled with emotions that are easily identifiable and sing-along-able.   Based on your suggestions we'll create a festive  touching and versatile programme for the sing-along sessions at Gloria Stage on Thursday  Friday and Saturday mornings during the festival.,4
Does anyone have a East 1 entrance booking for sale? ?????? Feel free to contact me if you have one for sale or know someone who does!,0
Can't even begin to comprehend the criticism of this (and other) years music program.  There are so many  many band names on the poster - I do belive there is something for everyone.  The Roskilde Fetival is not a genre specific festival. If you want more metal  more techno  more hip hop ect. ect.  then go attend one of the genre dedicated festivals.  So a specific headliner you wanted to see  hasn't been booked? Well so be it. Go for the smaller (and for you) unknown bands.  I refuse to belive that within the vast amount of bands isn't at least 20 bands for everyone.  And then ofcourse there is the fact  that no other festival has the same spirit as Roskilde. The main strenght of the festival is  that it isn't genre specific.   There is something for everyone  so you will get to meet every type of person. Not just the techno-freaks  the metal-head  the indi-hipsters and so on.  Cheer up  see the festival as a whole  use the waiting time to discover new bands and come spend a week of the summer with a crowd of diversity of people.,0
Looking for a one-day ticket for tomorrow (Wednesday 29.06). Anyone selling one? :),0
I have a Full Festival Ticket for sale....,0
Today at 16.15 Edward Snowden will give a live interview via satellite connection from his exile in Moscow in Rising City.   The interview is part of our Equality focus and Snowden will be talking about human rights  digital rights and surveillance.,4

Not this year  no. Sorry.,0
I liked the cinema!,0

Practical question - both me and my husband are working as volunteers for the festival. We are planing to take our baby girl with us when we are off the shifts. We know that we can get her a wrist(foot)band  but what about the stroller? Can we have one with us in the backstage (we both work there) and/or the territory?,0
Short answer: Presumably yes. But do check with the person in charge of your working area.,0
Hi  I would like to sleep in my car and to buy a  sleep in buses  ticket. Is that also possible  if its not a bus but a bigger car? (combi),0
What you need is a caravan camping ticket  not a sleep-in bus-ticket. Your car needs to be outfitted with a permanently mounted fire extinguisher and it probably also needs to be registered for camping purposes. You can read the rules here and here:  http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?accommodation=caravan-mc-s-and-sleep-in-buses  http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2008/2015-caravan-camping-guidelines-information.pdf,0

Camp Coffin is well known at Roskilde Festival. Since 2006 they have stayed in camping West in area C.

This year  Roskilde Festival is giving them a little something back: a wedding ceremony carried out on Orange stage  where Christine Tallulah and Øystein “Ace” Kvanneid will say ‘I do’. Everyone is invited to participate in their party on 2 July 2013 in Camping area C41. Learn more about Camp Coffin here: http://roskilde-festival.tv/coffin-camp-episode-1-the-coffin,35

Take good care of each other.,0
Dear Nina. Thanks for you're post. We are looking into the case but we want to make it absolutely sure that Roskilde Festival does not accept this kind of behaviour. Please help us spread the word and remember the orange feeling is about tolerance  love and taking good care of each other.,0

GENE SIMMONS: KISS TO PLAY EUROPE BEFORE  THE TOUR   Recently GeneSimmons.com posted updates about Gene & KISS events  among many...  This summer is shaping up to be the beginning of a two-year long full schedule. KISS and Motley Crue tour starts in July. And before then KISS will be in Europe for a festival or two.  We can't say which Festivals might be as all the biggest ones already announced their headliners...let's wait and see!  from http://www.deucenews.com/kiss-monster-tour-2012-13/ Please get Kiss to Roskilde :),0
I must admit Atli. This is getting close. Really close. Specially when the band should have played Sonisphere the same weekend. New album coming out. Never played Roskilde. A lack of a heavy headliner. Always gives a show. This could be!,0
Yeah i really hope that Gene Simmons is talking about Roskilde i really hope. Kiss to headline will be awesome to have :) I saw Kiss in 2010 in Malmö Sweden and the show was awesome :),0
   We can't say which Festivals might be as all the biggest ones already announced their headliners  - but Roskilde hasn't announced a heavy headliner yet! There are room!,0
Yeah there is a room for Kiss. I will be very happy if we will get Kiss to Roskilde :),0

Everyone is invited to participate in their party on 2 July 2013 in Camping area C41. Learn more about Camp Coffin here: http://roskilde-festival.tv/coffin-camp-episode-1-the-coffin,35
We'll take care of your friend <3,0

Hey Roskilde Festival  If I want to have my car parked outside of the festival  do I need to buy a ticket? Or how does it work?   Rasmus,0
Hi Rasmus. We offer free parking at Roskilde Festival. If you want to park right next to the camping area  you can also pay to park by one of the main entrances. Paid parking will be for sale later in the season. http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?transport=parking,0
Hi Roskilde  thanks for the answer! When can i expect the parking-sale to be opened?,0
New pics added to the Weird stuff that looks like Orange Stage. Let us know if you got something similar.,0
History is cyclic  in the grand scheme of things - Orange has been before and will come again - as witnessed by the Orange mountain on the right and the futuristic Digital-Orange stage on the left  ),0
We just decided to update the album with new pics in celebration of our friend # 75.000!!! Now we are a full festival in here. Thanks!,0
@ Summoned Tide -> See website for booking info + this page: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/?1633,0
https://instagram.com/p/2aqOz2gzHW/  I found this rock the other day. Haha,0
Always on his mind ????,0
Hi there Mikkel. Anders is totally right  you just show up  pay your ticket  and have the time of your life!,0
You are very welcome! Though  we love non-hippies too  so feel free to join us!,0
Have a great night party animals!  Photo: Kasper Jack Larsen,14
done! what is the best way to get to roskilde  we will be at malmö  swe  by train 18pm. tomorrow? thanks,0
18pm? Do you mean 18.00 or 6PM? Either way  Øresundstoget runs to Copenhagen H  where you have to change trains to get to Roskilde. Total travel takes about 70 mins.,0
The winner of the Earlybird Camp competition is Crazy Legs! The runner-ups were Camp Mordor and Camp Farmer Dating. Stay tuned for tomorrow where this years Sustainability Camp will be found,6
Hey guys  loving the festival so far! On wednesday  i will join my friends in the Uptown Camp  is it possible to get tents together  like in previous years?,0
Gonna be a got dam moth'a fuqa sick  dqfuk weeek man !,0
15 acts still to be announced - don't let me down again  Roskilde! They are in Europe  they have a free day on their touring schedule  they have never played in Denmark... if you do this for me  I will never complain about the line-up again!,0
Buy daily and full tickets. Make offers privat mess.,0
Book your entrance now to be among the first to enter the campsite at #RF15 - roskil.de/rf15ticket  Both tickets and Caravan Camping are selling fast - get your ticket before it's too late.   Photo: Khanh Gia,7

Yesss I'll call you this weekend  and will try to make it not 4am for you ??,0
Sounds like a plan :D talk soon,0
Hahaha you wish! Im planning on smoking and drinking so much that i wont know up from down...yaay:),0
Want to be among the first to enter the camp sites at #RF15?  Tomorrow at 10.00 (CET) you can book the entrance you want to use.   The waiting areas are open from Friday 26 June at 16.00 and the camping entrances open Saturday 27 June at 16.00.,115
Did you miss out on yesterday's concerts? Experience Roskilde Festival 2013 in your camp or on your couch back home with Orange TV. And stay tuned - more concerts are coming.,6
which concerts will you show? i would love it if your showing Drenges gig,0
All Pavilion Junior concerts will be uploaded and from Thursday there will be livestreaming from certain concerts.,0
Camp Club Tropicana are looking for George Michael. Can you help them?,24
He's probably at the banana stand.,0
she squats  bro.,0
hahaha Brage :D,0
Volbeat is playing Friday at 1:00 on Orange stage. You can always check out our website http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/band_schedule/date/1373038200/,0
Obviously the windows app isnt properly updated.,0
There is a bug in the Roskilde app for Windows affecting concerts after midnight. All other concerts should be displayed at the right time. We are doing our best to fix it,0
Machine FUCKING Head! \m/ \m/,0
Pladen Unto The Locust disagrees with you.,0
Hey Roskilde! When is the schedule for when everybody is playing released? :o) Jacob.,0
Which one of these four rock acts are you going to see?  ,0
Mutiny on the bounty,0
The CULT!,0
Anders said it.,0
I was going to say none  but I could be tempted by the Cult. Now please go out and see what the vox pop thinks of Gurrumul  Ruben Blades and Staff Benda Bilili!,0
Hopefully all of them  so don't put them all on different stages at the same time  okay?  ),0
The Cult! maybe Red Fang if im in the mood for it,0
Im looking forward to the camping  im sure someone will being a decent stereo :D thats where the partay will be at lol,0
Cult!! Been waiting since -87..,0
Machine Head  Behemoth  DevilDriver  Red Fang  Crowbar  The Cult  Warbringer  Baroness  Weedeater  Hank 3  Nasum  RedWood Hil  Cerekloth  Liturgy!,0
Ignoring what each actually did as a whole  and just judging from the sound bites... The Cult sounding like the indie pop  rock  that Roskilde has way too much of the past 4-5 years (bringing a guitar doesn't magically turn it into rock). Ignoring them in this case. In order: Mikal Cronin  Behemoth  Red Fang.,0
I think the metal line-up this year is not weak but a little strange.Machine head?3rd time?strange booking but I guess they are big in Denmark.Cult is also a little strange but ok I guess.Roskilde used to be real good at metal acts back in the 90´s and early 20´s but now they really need help with these bookings.,0
Johan - but you can't ignore the fact of a whole day only with sludge metal. Thats something! :),0
and Machine Head has a new great album out - so thats a obvious choice - and yes they are  big  in Denmark..,0
I really would have liked to see some finnish metal like nightwish or Children of bodom.,0
Behemoth  maybe. Definitely Machine Head and DevilDriver! It's always a party with Machine Head  and DevilDriver are just insane,0
Behemoth guaranteed. Probably also The Cult. As for the other two: who knows? A lot of cool bands are always bound to play at the same time.,0
No doubt - RED FANG!!,0
nr4   the cult,0
Hope you had a great monday. Sure looks like it! Check out the recap here.  Ready for another day at Roskilde Festival 2016?,33
Hey Roskilde Festival! Any news on parking tickets?,0
Hey Oliver. Not just yet. We will let you know as soon as they are up for grabs.,0
Hey! Yeah  it's you i'm talking to. If you would be so kind and answer this short questionaire about apps for Roskilde you would not just help out my group and i  but also receive a lot of loving thoughts from me. And if we meet at Roskilde i'll make sure to hug you like you've never been hugged before! Thank you!,0
Which day will Bon Iver perform?,0
Are these the rest of the names or are there anymore bands coming? Besides  this is a great list so far :) the only problem is just that I'm going to have to chose between a lot of bands :(,0
Throwback to Roskilde Festival 2014! Remember those 8 amazing days last year?  Don't miss out on this year's festival. Get your ticket before it's too late: roskil.de/rf15ticket,66
Roskilde Festival how many tickets are left?,0
Asla Húsgarð :D <3,0
Daaamer ???? Michelle T Pedersen  Wiktoria Nowakowska  Thea Jægerfeldt Larsen  Trine Pedersen  Brigitte Piller,0
We cant give you an exact number  Benjamin. But tickets are selling fast - and we recommend that you buy your ticket as soon as you know if you're going this year.,0
Aight  i already got my ticket. I was just wondering when  the ticket was going to sell out Roskilde Festival,0
Great to hear  Benjamin. And don't worry. We will let you know  when we're sold out.,0
Question: Is there somewhere  where i can either buy  or legaly download a copy  and print the Roskilde Festival posters in size A4?,0
You mean this? http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2003/roskilde-festival-2015-poster.pdf  Scale to fit  and presto  it's A4.,0
yes and no. As i want ALL the festival posters  not just from this year,0
The festival probably has an archive of the posters as digital files  but as some aren't in DIN formats they will look really weird when scaled to A4.,0
think ill just go and ask at the office :),0
We don't have that this year  sorry.,0
No worries..,0
We have electrified our rides! Roskilde Festival would not exist without the vehicles  but this year we are trying to do it a little greener.,4
Great initiative  but my god  they're fugly! :-),0
Since those things can clearly only transport people  why not ditch them altogether and go with cargo bikes?  Even though they're zero emission vehicles  the carbon footprint on creating them and transporting them to Denmark is still massive.,0
Dudes enjoying sunset on Roskilde skate sunday 2013.,0
We love you right back!!!,0
The one day tickets are valid for 24 hours starting at 05:00 and ending 05:00 the next day. So you have to wait a little bit  but we promise it will be worth it. See you soon!,0
That's not cool! We hope you find it again.,0
Thank you for a good program. I wouldn't have complained if there had been more of the really big names  but that would probably just have kept me away from some of the 30+ minor acts that I want to see  so it's okay. Thumbs up from me. :),0
Niclas Erbo  No it is not possible to only buy tickets for camping site. We stribe to make the festival as much about the music as possible. Hope you decide to come by anyway though.,0
Yeah  i would drop by  but as i said  i wouldnt pay 1800 kr for just being able to be there wednesday...  But who knows  maybe i will come by :P,0
Too much traffic!,0
And now you can view it here as well: http://issuu.com/roskilde-festival/docs/orange_press_rf2013_01-07-2013,0
Why limit yourself? You should stay the whole week!,0
I know  I have a saturday ticket and somebudy has to run the city while you have fun @roskildefestival  ),0
We are sorry about the the inconvenience  Ditte Dibber.The entrance 50 this year is only for vehicles. We hope you have a good festival even though the walk is a bit longer,0
I'm really over the moon about the fact that you have booked Bellowhead for this year's festival. When I saw them at Roskilde a few years back  it was the best gig of the whole weekend. And I have no doubt they will be equally magnificent this year. That Bruce guy has got some serious competition! No question which of the two concerts I'm most thrilled about!,0
Where the hell is RIVAL SONS on the poster?! What happened guys?,0
Can you post the video about Appartjik?,0
I'm not here to whine or anything  although I'm not ecstatic about the lineup  but will there be any more major announcement? How many more bands will be announced (approximately) and will there be a headliner within these?,0
Driving from Frederica to #RF16 in 3 hours. Message me if you want a free ride,0
Wish i could be there like last year :(,0

No  but feel free to ask all your questions here,0
Okay  fair enough. :) Is it possible to get access to a computer with Internet somewhere..?,0
How old does a Fox get and is there a place to get your hands meassured?,0

What would you prefer - a 'lag tæsk' or a 'røvfuld'?,0
What kind of doping does Michael Mørkøv use?,0
Is there anything women does better than men? If yes  what?,0
Connie Pedersen  You can send one person to get all your tents but he/she need to show the other tentowners tickets. We hope it works out and that you'll have a very nice festival!,0
You have a great world music lineup as always! thank you Roskilde!!,0
http://www.musikknyheter.no/news/8292,0
Unfortunately not. But you can ask the postmen in Dream City whether they can help you,0
It's on. It just needs to update. Check it now,0
Recap from Epic Vinyls from Brazil - Saturday in Skate City!,0
Good idea or bad idea?  Our schedule is right here: www.roskilde-festival.dk/schedule/2015,22

From up and above it looks like you've settled nicely  but how are things on the inside? Let us know what's happening in your tents and camps and remember to tag it #rfhome Photo: SH Luftfoto,97
sorry  but what happens in my tent is private bussiness :),0
Oh wow. How I wish I was there. Had a great time last time when I was there 2011.,0

Anyone selling a full festival ticket? Contact me!,0
Can you get a piercing at the festival site?,0
Hi Evelyn  there are some tattoo shops in east at L-area and the other is close to Apollo  maybe they have piercings too. There might be some places when the festival site opens on wednesday. However  for sanitation reasons we are not sure it is a service we provide. :) Have a great festival,0
Tensions were running high earlier today at the hummel football event – but in the end  the police lost to Christiania! Come to Camping West to play some sports with your friends.,4
wonder how many will be there ?,0

Hi RF   My ticket says entrance booking is included  however it does not state which entrance.  It was purchased in January.  Should I choose my entrance after 8th of May?,0
Hi Martin. Yes  you can book entrance after 8 May. It will be available right here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/tickets,0
Friday 3 July 22.30 Orange Stage!  Check out the new song by Disclosure and get ready to party when they hit the Orange Stage at #RF15.,2
What is Roskilde festival email ?,0
Orange??? This music belongs in a ghettoblaster in one of the speedfreak camps  ),0
more beer time in the camp then:),0
How easy is travel to and from the site from the centre of Copenhagen?  The main bit I'd be interested in knowing is what is the latest time I could leave each day to Copenhagen? I'd be looking at sleeping there but obviously don't want to be going home early every night!,0
Very easy  if past Roskilde Festivals is anything to go by. If it is just like past years  then most days  at least the four main festival days  buses will depart for Copenhagen every half hour from entrance East until 4AM. You can take the train to Roskilde Station every half hour as well – also until 4AM. There are a couple of direct trains to Copenhagen during the night as well.,0
Separate entrance bookings will be sold from 8th May according to the festival. You won't be able to enter early without an entrance booking  but sometime later in the evening the entrances open again to people without entrance booking.,0
Takk anders. Do you know How much do the Entrancebooking cost? And when will the ordinary Entrance open on saturday?,0
Hey Roskilders!  Is anyone driving from Oslo (or Southern Norway  Götenborg or anywhere near Oslo) to the festival on Wednesday or Thursday?  I'm an Australian  coming down from Svalbard to travel in Europe and go to Roskilde (wooohooo!!) but I need to get there. I'm very happy to share driving and put in some petrol money :) Inbox me if you'd like a cheerful Australian in your car :),0
Hi Gian! We will live stream concerts from Orange Scene  Arena and Pavilion from Thursday. The concerts can be seen (and heard) on www.roskilde-festival.dk  where an overlay will appear on the websites frontpage  whenever live-streams are available. The concerts can then be enjoyed at home or wherever  you might be.,0
I asked this because I wanted to know if Metallica's show was going to be streamed  but thanks anyway!,0
If they let us  we will.,0
I hope so hahahaha thanks!,0

Any news on when the three off-venue concerts for Khun Narin's Electric Phin Band will take place?,0
Hi Andri  they play at Gloria  wednesday at 17.30,0
It is actually not annouced yet  partly because it depends on weather conditions and other logistics .This means that Wednesday is the only day set so far. Keep an eye on facebook - location and dates it will be posted soon.:),0
Alright  I just hope those don't clash as badly with my already packed concert schedule :),0
Lets hope not :) Have a great festival :),0
No  they also play AROUND the festival before the Gloria concert. But where  Roskilde?,0
I know that  but in the description it says that they are playing the Gloria show and three off-venue concerts. Anything confirmed with those three off venue concerts?,0

Oi  Roskilde. Are you screening England v Iceland anywhere on the site  and if so  where? Would love to know now so we can arrange to to elsewhere if not. Cheers!,0
Hi Roskilde. My friends and I have booked five tents in Uptown. They can't make it to Roskilde untill thursday  and since we would like to have tents close together  will I be able to pick tents for our group when I arrive  if I have their tickets with me?  See you soon :-),0
Hi Anders. Yes  it is possible for you to pick tents for your group when you arrive. You will need to have their tickets AND a power of attorney from all of them.,0
Hi Andreas. Not as far as we know. But there are great concerts at both Apollo Countdown and Pavilion Junior tonight.,0
Maybe? You never know,0
You need to show picture ID.,0
It depends on the card and what information there is on it. Normally  a passport or a driver's licens is preferred.,0
How do you relax at the festival? Please show us...,19
You shoudnt relax but party all 7 days! :),0
Its at the lake around camp P  if you like go check out the other side  my mom and her colleague is doing some meditation out there :-),0
I'm not @ Roskilde Festival to relax. I'm there to HEADBANG.  Metallica \m/ . I'm coming from germany to Roskilde for them,0
I think this is from the beach zone :),0
Aha ... A  new zone  that indeed wasn't there 1993-94... Or is it maybe the Camping area at Roskilde Fjord ? But then it is not on the Festival area :-) Whatsoever .. Have a nice festival and a wonderful evening now (y),0

No but it will be possible to walk through the festival site instead.,0
Free charging of your phone at this year's festival. Not bad  huh? 3 Danmark have helped put up 13 charging stations around the festival where you can charge your phone for free.  If you don't want to leave your phone  you can buy a Volt battery and charge your phone directly in your pocket.,11

Hi Aksel! Not as far as we know but we will look into it.,0

Hey Roskilde  I love your line-up and I'm looking forward to e.g. M83 and The Cure! <3  But I have a question not concerning the music. Will Area M be secluded by a bridge over the road again?  ,0
A real disappointment roskilde  damn you...!,0
Very disappointed your site was down and I couldn't get on your tonight to see the announcement.,0
Where do I find the map over Roskilde festival in your Roskilde app?? Please help! I need halp! Halp pls,0
Menu -> Map  If you don't have it  you should update the app,0
Everything is ok except very poor food stalls in a sense that even if the food is kind of expensive that would not be the worst thing. Problem is a portion you get in every stall. Child portion for 70 krona makes me starving all the time.... I think you pay for service not actual food cause its negligible if you get more pasta or less pasta when pasta costs 5 krona whole pack. I want to pay 70 but i want to feel full at least for one second,0
Hi Juan  we're sorry to hear - you should know that you are welcome to buy and bring your own food from supermarkets to the camping sites - maybe this could help fix your problem. Have a great festival :),0
When is Den Sorte Skole playing at Ghettoblaster tonight? It's not in the schedule :),0
Hi Rasmus  i've just check the schedule and i can't see that Den sorte skole should be played today. Please see the attached link showing the schedule: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/arts-events/ghettoblaster,0
Thanks for the reply. Hmm  that's weird  because I got this notification from the RF app :),0
Hi Rasmus  alright - that is a bit weird. Well i guess you need to stay close to the ghettoblaster tonight then  so you don't miss it :),0
Alright  I'll do that. They sure take the whole element of surprise very serious  -),0

We’re NOT monitoring your calls and text messages.  It’s all part of an art project thought up by the satirical activist and art group The Yes Men in collaboration with Edward Snowden and Roskilde Festival.,14
Excellent work guys.  I'm still amazed that people simply don't care when government does this - But when a private act does it  people go absolutely NUTS!  IMHO you should have waited to reveal it  ),0
Good job with this stunt  I appreciate it,0
Feel like Roskilde Festival fucked me over - but in a good way! Appreciate the lay  Roskilde! If you're ready for a rematch  let me know  ),0
Make sure you come check out the Edward Snowden interview tomorrow,0
What time is the interview coming?,0
Great work guys! looking forward to the interview!,0
Awesome! Can you PM me please!,0
is it full festival ticket? And do you still have them?,0
Check our page for non-stop update from the Graffiti team!,1
Hej! If I check in with accreditation at Tekniske skole  will I still get a  real  wristband? I won a ticket at gaffa.se but never received it from you so I got a check-in card from gaffa instead. Farvel,0
A media accreditation typically  only  gains you a media wristband made of paper. This  however  has a few advantages  since you with this wristband have access to other areas aswell as the regular camping and festival areas :),0
What Anders said :),0
Hi! I left my festival ticket behind in Oslo  and am now in Denmark. What do I need to do to get in? Thanks!,0

Hi Terje what Anders said,0
Nicolai We are looking into where there is space and will get back to you asap. Area F shouldn't open unless there is sold out.,0
Cheers anyway. We can't get a general overview at the time. Last night was a hell. So it would be very kind of you  if you could help us finding a place.,0
If you have a question to our music director or spokeswoman then go to our twitter and post it right away!,0
and remember to use #rf12,0
Why bother? ... she is the most incompetent director I have EVER seen in my entire life... FUCK! - what a waste of what used to be a great music program ... now we have to settle with the camp life and atmosphere - Roskilde could be so much more if only the mgmt would be replaced... fine with experimental music  but why do we need 200 bands? - you could never see it all - that is precisely why we cant attract a wide number of BIG acts anymore... JESUS!,0
I have one... With all the qualified and intelligent people in Denmark  how on earth did you end up picking a neanderthal of a girl that doesen't speak a word of english to direct the questions? I mean  whoever saw your announcements and cant understand english got absolutely NOTHING from the audience- and twitter questions.. Stuff for thought :),0
This line-up show was extremely embarrassing regarding translation into english. Who hired  the question girl ? Completely incoherent weird  half translated half not -round of questions. Is it that difficult?,0
I HAD hope for this years festival. But with Megaphonic Thrift and Bernhoft as best acts  all hope is gone!,0
Yes it is :),0

Hi. Some of my friends bought different entrance bookings  and our thought was to enter together. We can only order 1 per ticket on your site  so im wondering how we do dis.,0
When you’ve already bought an entrance ticket  you have the option to change it to another entrance (if it’s not sold out – otherwise you can buy one after May 8th). We kindly ask you to contact Billetnet/Ticketmaster  as they are the official Roskilde Festival 2015 ticket vendor. They can help you change the entrance ticket. Billetnet can be reached by phone: +45 70156565 or via www.billetnet.dk,0

I met Edward Snowden at the toilets and had a chat about the #rf16 data privacy issue. He's quite upset and will give a speech at Rising today at 16.00.,0
Sorry you were stuck for so long. Yesterday we had ca. 35.000 guests arriving within a short time span. We hope your passengers have a great festival.,0

The schedule is ready along with 7 new acts: www.roskilde-festival.dk/schedule  Download pdf here: http://roskil.de/musicschedule2015  Don't miss out  get your ticket in time: http://roskil.de/rf15ticket,83
Do you have a list of the 7 new acts..? It's a bit hard to find them in the schedule..,0
Father John Misty and Ryan Adams clashing is a bit of a disaster.,0
I'm also wondering  what are the 7 new bands? I can see Kodaline and Corrosion of conformity  which you also mentioned  but what bands are added besides them?,0
Where is Burnt Friedman & Jaki Liebezeit? According to nonplace.de  they should play saturday. Hope they are coming....,0
The times for the artists are wrong in the app. For instance it says pharell starts at 20. Everything is two hours off it seems,0
Kwabs on pavillion?,0
Cool with Corrosion! But a shame you feel the need to ruin Every Time I Die and All pigs must die´s shows by scheduling them at 13 and 14! as seen many times before  that just doesnt work for these kind of bands that normally can set things on fire :(,0
Kendrik  Le1f and Run the Jewels  playing at the same time...that's sad..:(,0
Will the Africa Express set go on all night on Saturday? Or should one rely on Jamie XX for the  last dance ?,0
Ciaran Byrne Muse at 10pm? o.O,0
So you still need to fill 2 more acts? Can you PLEASE get POND to play!!  https://m.facebook.com/pondling?refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch,0
Sure Lucas. They are: CORROSION OF CONFORMITY COURTESY FOGHORN STRINGBAND HUDNA KANE WEST KODALINE TWIN PEAKS,0
Here you go  Christian: CORROSION OF CONFORMITY COURTESY FOGHORN STRINGBAND HUDNA KANE WEST KODALINE TWIN PEAKS,0
Kanye West or Kane West??,0
Kane West - so close,0
We know. There's an issue with the feed. We're working on it. Hope to be up and running soon,0
We know. There's an issue with the feed in the app. We're working on it. Hope to be up and running soon,0
Julius  no  tha'ts not a typo. He is indeed called KANE WEST,0
Thank god its not Kanye West.,0
HØRT HØRT!!! Roskilde Festival  do something about it!!,0
We're always trying to avoid genre clashes - and metal-wise Saturday is full of good stuff. So we put Every Time i die and All Pigs Must die in these specific slots in order NOT to have any metal clashes. We're certainly not doing this to 'ruin' anything.,0
Thanks for the reply  i know that not everyone can play at 22.00 in the evening  but these kind of shows demands a lot of the audience to be successfull  and that kind of energy just isnt there that early in the day.,0
Could be as part of Africa Express?,0
There's 1.5 hour between Kendrick and RTJ,0
No  you're not alone.,0
ahh  that's right! So Kendrik 45 min  Le1f 45 min and Runthe Jewels 45 min  so I can find a place beföre Disclosure!  Awesome line-up!,0
There are still 3 empty slots  tba   so my bet is Gloria at 16.30...,0
Arena is a lot better for metal,0
We'll just have to kick up the dust and set the tends ablaze early then  won't we?  ),0
Hear  hear! Green Stage has always been the best venue for solid metal.,0
If there is room to move  pits move!!,0
Africa Express will be one long party - AT LEAST 4 hours  maybe more!,0
We've got 3 TBA's in the schedule.,0
I hope it's POND! ??,0
Big up on the Courtesy booking! :),0
10:30 it looks like but they play til 1am?  Decent set.,0
ohhh true i didnt see the +30,0
yeh thats a good amount of time,0
You will need to have a special wristband for this,0
The entrances are now open and we are putting on wristbands. Remember to change this temporary wristband to a normal festival wristband before Tuesday.  Also remember that if you are at the camping area WITHOUT a valid wristband  you risk getting a fee of DKK 3500. So get that wristband and happy campin',5
(Y),0
Risk? You should go around giving the fees to those without a wristband now!,0
@RF Pics or it didnt happen  ),0
May all of you burn in the fire of my total and utter envy!  ) God festival! :),0
Ive got intrance South  can I go in at west  joining in 2 hours from now,0
We were promised armbands  and all I got was a stupid wristband!,0
Ticket left behind in Oslo  I'm in Copenhagen. What do I do?,0
Kim: We are actually doing that right now,0
Good! Still waiting until 1900 pm  gotta get a crappy spot again this year.. Ha ha ha,0
Asger: When everyone with entrance booking is through  then the entrances will open for everyone else and not close again untill Roskilde Festival is over,0
Kim: The Perfect Spot Is a Lie  -),0
Kim: ....good neighboors one the other hand  aren't,0
You want a picture? Still sitting at west 1  got a volunteer wristband. I have a chair and beers  life is good!,0
Bogi Í Dali: Working on it - check #rf13 on Instagram/twitter for updates/pids from the people,0
Is there any chance entrance booking won't be needed later on tonight  or is it necessary until tomorrow?,0
Nikolaj Hansson: It isn't necessary anymore  so you can use any entrances,0
Cecilie Holm Arentoft: In the same entrances as everyone else (but from the day your ticket is valid of course),0
Mads Have Christensen: From now on you can enter through all the normal entrances,0
Please chill and don't cheat your fellow friendly festivalgoers in line. The entrance will open in 20 minutes and here you'll get your wristband,1
Note: If you can't show a valid wristband at the camping area  then you risk getting a DK 3500 fee,0
We'll just repeat what we told you 17 hours ago when you said the fence was down  shall we:  There is no fence - just a line...and if there was  it isn't down. ,0
Don't bring stress Rune - bring beer. Look  we even rolled out the sun. But of course we are also happy that you're looking forward to get in. Lot's of love :-),0
No more beer  thanks for the sun though  also #hegnetervæltetivest,0

Hey Roskilde! When are you opening the F area? We have people sitting here who can not get ANY answers from anyone!,0
billetlugen.dk or check here -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/topics/tickets/ Beware of counterfeits,0
Where is the restricted volunteer camping location? Nobody knows and nobody tells! :/,0
When you check in  you'll get a map... but if you can't wait  I can tell you that is is an area just left of the C area,0
Service announcement:  The WEST 2 entrance is full.  People with tickets for WEST 2 should head for entrance SOUTH 1 - or wait at the parking area just south of WEST 2. We are working on clearing this area right now.   We are very sorry  but due to safety reasons we simply cannot let more people in the WEST 2 area.,18
miss you  Roskilde :-( ,0
don't know if you guys are in yet but Steen El Duderino Thomsen  Ethan McGuirk  Charlene McKenna,0
Gonna miss roskilde today because I didn't make my entrance bookings am gonna be there tommorow,0
PS. it is raining!,0
SO what are you gonna do Roskilde  if the leftover tickets from West 2 fill up in south 1  so that those who have tickets for south can't come in there? Are you gonna make an extra entrance for them  or is it now just who's the fastest or most aggressive?,0
When Will those In the parking area come In Then?,0
Can you use the other enterances even Tho you booked for West 2  and first Will arrive at 7 pm ??,0
The waittime just means more time for drinking beer!,0
Will I be able to use the train station entrence after 18.00?,0
We were told that we had to get up of our chairs and pack things together so that it will be room for more people in West 2. So now we have to stand for 3 hours with houndreds of people close together.,0
So without entrance booking  you can come in when the lines are cleared?,0
Which of the two entrances in west is #2? On your map it only says Entrance 1 and Entrance 5.. Not West 1 & 2..,0
Its just- I have east 1  but want to go in through east 2 - so I wont be able to so that at 18  or?,0
This sucks . So im waiting for 3 hours on the grass  b,0
I hope you are going to send us an update if there should be any other problems regarding the entrance booking,0

The Shins? Let's hope ...,0
This band is already released - but there's more to come!  Watch the Lineup release TODAY!  All you have to do is go to roskilde-festival.com at 16:00 and you can watch our live stream from the event. ,11
BRUCE!!! :D,0
Can't wait :),0
I can not wait :),0
Dennis Hyttel  today at 16:00 - Tune in at roskilde-festival.dk and watch the livestream from the release.,0
I hope we will get Slash to Roskilde :),0
you know its 4pm already in lots of places... So come on!! :),0
mr brucve is a reasin not to use money or be a member of mass psychosis... and bjørk as well... good night... capitalism contra colonialism... good luck...,0
You're a bit too early. Have a drink or something.,0
Mail Blender.  Mail. Rail. Railje.. Railge... Raige.. Raige.. Rage.. BLender.. Equipment.. Appliance.. MACHINE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE bum  solved,0
2 acts  letters a mixture of: a secrecy teeth them having is my interpretation,0
But what about the mail and blender?,0
Linnea: It means Letters mixed. Alas that we have to mix the letters in the sentence  a secrecy teeth.... ,0
No wait  I got it. Post-Grindcore,0
Well  that only leaves over 65 thousand anagrams. Great...,0
Try and remove  The Vaccines   ),0
If the second band don't have any likes on facebook  it could be Arch Enemy,0
It can't be RATM  they are not an European band.,0
If the first band is The Vaccines  then the letters left for the second band is: REY ET THEM HIG,0
And if we guess that the band name starts with  THE  that leaves us with: R E Y E T M H I G,0
Damn i have my final exams today but all I can think about is this anagram,0
 I get the rhyme ?,0
Well  it could mean post metal  which makes sence - sólstafir is a post metal band that has played on Roskilde before  and they're touring with their new album svartir sandar *crossing fingers*,0
Thirup - no. They've made the  letter mix  clue before.,0
Will you announce the bands on your facebook page during the live streaming tomorrow?,0
We'll try to keep you updated on Facebook. But if you have a Twitter profile  you should know that we have a Twitter stream + an input box on our streaming page. Just remember to use the tag #rf12,0
So i should just follow Roskilde festival on Twitter to stay updated?,0
how far off is the announcement? im in australia so cant listen in.,0
Anton Demant Olin  I take it you can't watch the streaming? In that case both I'd say Twitter  but we're present in both channels. If you WILL be watching the thing  I'd say DEFINITELY Twitter.,0
Timothy  you need to find a websites for watches of the world if such a one exists. It's at 16:00 (4:00 pm) in our time zone.,0
Well  i will be able to watch some of it  but not the first part  thats why  :),0
http://www.twitter.com/BlastbeastMetal will update on hard rock  metal + dumb stuff like pictures and shit.,0
More info: BlowUpChurch.com,0
This band is already released - but there's more to come!  Watch the Lineup release TOMORROW: http://www.facebook.com/events/389436691069035/,13
Can't wait!,0
Black tusk next band out I hope :D,0
Sludge-day will be epic! I'm getting my beer on!,0
How about a live streaming of the concerts later on? That would be a great idea! :D,0
Nona Karnowska  great idea but it won't happen in 2012  unfortunately. It's better to be here when it happens  btw  -),0
i'm sure it is but you know  the crisis and all...,0
Spoiler for tomorrow.  No Rage  No Daft Punk!,0
Thank god! Then maybe people will shut up  and make room for constructive criticism.,0
Whoever expects and demands bands that aren't touring will always be disappointed.,0
True  but Prince wasn't touring in 2010  so one could have hoped for a similar deal.,0
They stated back then that it was an one-off. A one-in-a-thousand chance or so.,0
Well  let's just hope for next year!,0
The Sunday recap is out! We can see you have been enjoying the warm weather and the beer bowling. Here is the recap from yesterday  we hope today is just as great!,23
Is it possible to watch the EM game Island versus England tonight at the Festival?,0
Hej Anita Due to rights issues  the matches from the European Championships will not be shown at Roskile Festival.  Best regards Rikke,0
Can we expect more headliners for this year's program? :-)  Or are all headliners already presented?  Mvh. Anders P. :-),0
Can't see your comment? :/,0
It said no more headliners,0
Tomorrow at 9:00 (CET) we'll reveal the schedule for this year's Roskilde Festival.  We'll also reveal some new additions to the line-up (no headliners).,27
Fredrick Lindal :D,0
Hej Will your team be selling the festival ticket for this yeah in Folket park Malmö,0
Is this gonna be the final 9 acts? Or do you still have a few left?,0
(No headliners) Tanja  Ask  Kasper,0
Martine Neset Gjertsen Silje Landøy :D :D :D,0
Tried to sign up as volunteers  but got the confirmed mail from last year. The mail said I would receive a new mail to confirm  but still haven't got it.  Please help.,0
What about the schedule for the warm-up concerts?? :),0
Mia Skifte Lynge ?? there ya go!,0
Weeee! I Am ready!! ??????,0
That's mah boy,0
Are your ready? ??,0

10 in total  actually - but we haven't cleared them all so we'll announce 7 tomorrow.,0
That will be ready as well,0
Please send an email to volunteer@roskilde-festival.dk,0
Thank you Roskilde Festival :),0
Hey I have booked for entrance East 1  but will most likely be arriving at West. When can I expect to gain access to the West entrance  when I don't have a booking for that entrance?,0
I bought two Tuborg Packages but haven't received them yet  what should I do?,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  if I arrive at West 1 at about 20:00 o'clock - will it be possible to get in without an entrance-booking? Or  put in another way  at what time can I get in without an entrance-booking?,0
No festival-goers (except for volunteers) have a Roskilde wristband yet  so how is this possible? We haven't opened yet.  The police never cuts any wristbands - only the festival can do this.,0
We cannot react on rumours. The people in question need to contact the festival if they lack a wristband.,0
Understandable. You might consider looking into it yourselves though... Loosing your volunteers ain't good for anyone. Anyways  thank you for your responses  I hope you find the time to sort this out some time...,0
Nothing beats the first time!  Tell us about YOUR first Roskilde experience. Among all comments we'll pick a winner of a #rf15 ticket. Deadline: 3 May at 12:00 CET  EDIT: Thanks for all your wonderful posts and stories. Congrats to Saara Turtonen  you have won a ticket. Have a look in your inbox /probably under 'other').,17
Can I still enter or is it too late?,0
Do you want the text in english or is my swedish ok? :),0
My first  and only time at Roskilde Festival was in 1997 (or maybe 98). It was the time they had the worst rain and thunderstorms in 50 + years. The piss from the urinals was mixing with the mud. The Wu Tang Clan cancelled at the last minute. But  the lightning show was the most amazing part on top of the normal festivities. All of my Danish friends left early due to the weather  but since I had no other place to go  I stayed. It was epic!,0
I came to Roskilde in 2007 as a Roskilde Festival virgin. My friends had been there several times  but something had always come up  preventing me from going - until this year!   I was volunteering as a camping guard which at the time equaled 24 hours of work outdoors  inspecting the perimeter  guarding the toilets or the fire ring  or walking around with a fire extinguisher.   Now  I don't know if you recall  but 2007 was about as rainy as it gets. The entire camping area was flooded  the tents were literally disappearing into the mud  and so was some of the festival goers  I think. So how much fun do you think it was walking around the camping site with a fire extinguisher in the rain? Right. Not THAT much fun!  But during the Thursday  things magically changed! Some of the people in my camp were celebrating their 10th year anniversary at the festival by hosting a reception at the camp  including sparkling wine  canapés and live music performed by an à capella quartet and a band with a home built drum kit. What a party!   So while others were packing up and leaving the festival because they just couldn't take any more mud  and while the rain relentlessly kept falling  we were having the party of the year under our pavillon. Since then I have been coming back every year!,0
2003 was my first year and the memories from that festival with Metallica as the band to see that year was amazing! Me and 3 friends  all huge Metallica-fans in that time  ran to the Orange Stage when the music area opened and we all stood right in front of the stage waiting the whole day and night just to be close to our idols when they entered the stage. (I cant remember the other bands playing Orange Stage before Metallica that day). We managed to catch a pick from Kirk Hammet and after the show the party went crazy. I had absolutely NO voice in the next 3 or 4 days. Those memories will live forever in my mind. Thank you!,0
My First rf was last year. My cousin had moved from Canada to Germany to work there and ended up in Munich were I live so we hung out and became very close during that time (I haven't seen much family in 10 years because the flights are so expensive). For my 21st birthday he got us two tickets to Roskilde. Needless to say  I was very excited since it would be my very first festival. But what I experienced was something I could never have imagined before. The people  the music  the atmosphere... It was all the closest thing to magic I have ever felt and it has branded me since then in a way I still cannot understand. During the festival Major Lazer played on my birthday and The crowd went nuts and made 4 huge circle pits. Somehow I had ended up with an oversized Star Wars helmet on my head and I ran into the middle of the circle  started to do a little dance and it felt like 100000 people were cheering for me... My musical horizon has always been very wide but after rf#14 there were no more boundaries. It was the best week of my life and when I came back to Munich I was depressed for almost a month. My only wish was to live and die on a festival everyday of my life. So coming back to rf this year would be a great start  ),0
At my first RF (1990) the only thing you could buy for eating om the camping area was from a hotdog-stand. With a very long queue. Me and Berit went together and spend a long time in the tent making sure our hair was styled perfect. Much has changed - mostly for the better. Except for the animal-costumes :-P  This year will be my 25-anniversary. Only skipped 2004 because I was giving birth. But who cares - it was raining and Bowie cancelled  -),0
My first year was in 2000. I went to Roskilde foremost to see Pearl Jam  but in so many ways I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was instantly overwhelmed by this amazing place. The weather was pretty much horrible as far as I remember  switching between dry heat and cold rain in what felt like mere seconds  and my gear was of pretty low standard and very incomplete  so the challenges to get through the week in good health were monumental from the start. For some strange  yet unknown reason that didn’t bother me the slightest (except in the mornings  oh those terrible mornings). I walked on air for almost a week and it was glorious.  When the accident happened I was in the very thick of it  trying to help people of shorter stature reach up to gasp for air in the packed crowd  eventually getting myself pulled over the fence in front of the stage by guards  losing valuables  clothing and shoes in the process. When all was said and done  I ended up all alone  face down in the mud at one side of the stage  throwing up all over myself. After regaining some semblance of strength  I started making my way back to my camp  moving as in slow motion  dragging my legs behind me and barely noticing everything going on all around. At the time  it was by far the most traumatic thing I had ever experienced in my life. In a way  I guess it still is.  The morning after most of my camp left for home in despair  leaving just me and a few friends to hang in there and work our way through the final days of the festival. I had lost a lot of my belongings and things were looking pretty bleak all around to say the least. In possibly the worst of moods we decided upon making our way to the festival area once again. What happened next was nothing short of remarkable. We were surprised that there were so many people left  still hanging on  scrambling to make sense of everything  sharing our feelings. Slowly  softly everyone started to pick each other up  creating an atmosphere of empathy  tenderness and care for each other. The festival continued in the most respectful and peaceful manner one could ever imagine.  That year  those days  the extreme highs and lows  that experience has created an emotional bond to Roskilde festival in me. Since 2000  I have gone on to be a participant of the festival for a total of 13 years  so far only missing out on the years when my sons were born. Odds are I ultimately won’t be able to go this year either  as it has gotten harder and harder to go every year  grown up family man and all. Of the people I set up camp with for that first year  none have remained over time  having been replaced by others  and they in turn have been replaced by others  and that’s the way it goes I guess. Life is changing  as well as the festival  transforming  for both better and worse.   The bond remains.,0
You are not supposed to remember the first time..  Casper  Dun  Klein  Ian  Krogsgaard og Stæhr,0
Thanks for all your wonderful posts and stories. Congrats to Saara Turtonen  you have won a ticket. Have a look in your inbox /probably under 'other').,0
Is it May 3rd yet?,0
You can enter until 3 May. Good luck!,0
Guarding the toilets that don't seem fun but how many hours U had to work do u get free ticket for that,0
Ha ha  well  guarding  might not be the right word - we were just keeping an eye on them  and closing of the ones that were too disgusting.   Back then  you volunteered for 24 hours in total in exchange for a ticket. Now it's 32 hours. I will be volunteering in Sputnik Bar this year :),0
The rainy year was 1997 :-) ... which btw. was nothing compared to 2007. In 1997 about 43 mm rain fell during the festival. In 2007 it was about 100 mm – most of which came Thursday.   We've been lucky with the weather most years since then  but maybe we're in for something wet and cold soon again  statistically speaking.,0
but in 97 the rain never stopped. It was far worse than in 07.,0
In 2007 the sewer system was better and Roskilde Festival were better prepared. And as I remember  the wind blew faster in 97.,0
We are going to KOREA :D,0
Please read the article tho,0
Was there too  next to 2007  the rainiest year ever  hope all people who had their first year that year  came back and had it in sunny times :),0
I still remember the wristband girl:  Oh  didn't you hear....Bowie has cancelled  It still makes me sad :(,0
Ulla  so do we - but he hasn't played live for ages.,0
Some of us still believe :),0
Thanks for taking care of people at the PJ concert. I was in my camp at the time  but I have friends that were there  down in the mud.  I visit the memorial site every year to honor the dead and to remember to appreciate my loved ones.  Again  thanks for helping. You probably saved lives that day.,0
Awesome :D,0
Wow  thank you so much! Still find it hard to believe :D,0
I can not wait for Macca at Roskilde this summer :) ,0
Hi Sara. If you were guaranteed this last year  then you will be able to use it this year as well. Happy festival!,0
Welcome to Roskilde Festival 2013. The campsite opens at 18.00. Have a great festival!  This is what the opening of the campsite looks like when compressed to 30 seconds.,80
About time? http://roskilde-festival.dk/arts/zones/sonic_zone/ :-),0
I'm here :D <3,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  if I arrive at West 1 at about 20:00 o'clock - will it be possible to get in without an entrance-booking? Or  put in another way  at what time can I get in without an entrance-booking?,0
The vid reminds me of an Antfarm - enjoy Roskilde everyone,0
Will miss you all this year! :(,0
Line Elisabeth Degerhammar Kristofer Krook lucky you!,0
Where are all the great bands this year? I like only one,0
I don't think there's sold out. Usually the festival warns via Facebook and newsletters beforehand. If anything  it's just that the partout-tickets are only available on site now – you pay at the entrance.,0
Where is the reggae this year? We want reggae to roskilde!,0
The live video stream starts at 16:00,0
earlier you said 15:30?,0
Sorry sbout the confusion. We have the site ready at 15:30 and we go live at 16:00,0

We'll keep the numbers to ourselves. But we can tell you that we're selling loads of tickets these days  so don't wait too long.,0
Oh god im not sure that i can do it before may,0
Save one to me :) haha so i can join my Bording School Camp,0

When is it possible to buy parking tickets?,0

I booked a camp entrance when I got my ticket but my friends are entering and staying somewhere else. Will I still be able to go visit them where they are? Or can I switch my entrance to be the same as there's?,0
It'll be yet another while.,0
It certainly is. Come 8 May we'll open for bookings.,0
Not just yet Johannes.,0
S H I T,0
Very usefull information !,0
Wasn't it supposed to open for bookings on the 1st of May?,0
Hi Tyla. If you want to enter the festival together with your friends  the best option is definitely to change your entrance ticket  which you do by contacting BilletNet. BilletNet can be reached by phone: +45 70156565 or via www.billetnet.dk,0
I don't want to enter the festival with them. But is the entrance the ticket for where you get to camp as well? So if we have different entrances tickets does that mean we will be in different camp areas and not able to see each other?,0
Thanks for your help :),0
Usually people buy their entrance ticket in order to ensure that they get the camping spot that they want. However  you can easily enter the festival from e.g. entrance West and still camp in East. You will just have to walk a bit further  ) Also  even if you and your friends camp in different areas  you will definitely still be able to see each other - you are not  locked in  in your respective camp areas and are thus able to walk around the areas as you please.,0
have a nice festival,0
Hi Birgit. There is no upper limit to the number of +60 festivalgoers we let in Sunday (in a week)  so see you there,0

Roskilde Festival does a van get approved to bring to the caravan camping if it is registered as a  lätt lastbil  and I have a loose fire extinguisher?,0
Maybe this helps: http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2008/2015-caravan-camping-guidelines-information.pdf,0
Thanks  I did read that. Just found the rules a little tricky. I don't want to buy a ticket if I can't use it when I arrive.,0
Hi Viktoralia. A van should be ok,0
We’ve got some bad news. The Brazilian musician Tom Zé has just cancelled his whole European tour this summer  and that includes his performance at this year’s Roskilde Festival. Tom Zé suffers from health problems  which  ultimately  is the reason for cancelling his tour.  Tom Zé was supposed to play on Saturday 4 July  and his cancellation means that we are now working on 10 new acts to complete the line-up and not 9 as we thought.  Btw  the music schedule is out on Thursday.,5
Trippy Turtle  DJ Hoodboi or Lido. I'm counting on you to make the right choice. Every artist added to the lineup means 1 case of beer to the bookers,0
Halestorm Nothing more,0
The Pendulum!!,0
Dammit! I was looking forward to that! But thank you for introducing him anyway... Now go book Bob Hund and/or (even better) Can!,0
So thursday will reveal 10 new acts as well?,0
They are probably a little bit bigger than Tom Zé. Besides  any more headliners have been ruled out.,0
I know they are. Im just hoping  ),0
bytter gerne 10 acts for Dizzy (y),0
Forgot to say please...,0
Well  Can doesn't exist anymore  but actually Jaki Liebezeit  the drummer of Can  has announced himself for Roskilde along with Burnt Friedman: http://burntfriedman.com/dates/  Don't know if there is any credibility to it...,0
I second this,0
So much this!,0
I know  but they have been known to make the occational reunion (dont know if they did any after one of them died though... Its an old dream seeing them performing...) interesting link there! If we'll see them  one could imagine them appearing with the Africa Express..? I am looking very much forward to the specifics of that event!,0
Dream on,0
As many as we get ready.,0
Are you ready for Roskilde Festival?  Quiz your way through the line-up  win great prizes and challenge your friends for the highest score!,18
This band is already released - but there's more to come!  Watch the Lineup release on Thursday: http://www.facebook.com/events/389436691069035/,6
Love the music and his style of rapping but seriously  the lyrics are crap.,0
Typical american  gangsta  rap lyrics  but ye very nice flow and beat.,0
Sorry  artist is more correct..,0
Does that mean i get free tickets?,0
People aren't really listening to the lyrics. Anyone noticed the alphabet bars? Ill!,0
We don't quite follow either. We've been very focused on access to drinking water for some time now - last year there were additional water lines and lots of them both at the camping site  festival site and by the toilets. We're sorry you couldn't fint them  perhaps better signs can do the trick  but the water was there!,0
I will make note of this – I work with the printed programme. It's maybe an idea to mark the places with drinking taps on the map too  if it isn't already. Can't remember atm.,0
Just checked up on that. Indeed there aren't any markings of drinking water taps  but all the toilets are marked. Every toilet I went to last year also had drinking water  so I don't really see where this criticism stems from.,0
That sounds like an excellent plan  marking it on the map. I agree with all the toilets  but I still don't know what the signs were about - I should have taken a picture - the toilet  wagons  had signs  no drinking water . I suppose it was a mistake? But then why were the signs up?,0
Usually I found the water taps along the fences inside the festival area. There was also a water hose in between some of the stores. I only bought water once because I was in need of a bottle.,0
I'll be done with this 2 days afte the actual festival..,0
Keep at it  Rasmus. You're getting there.,0
I'm sure we'll have loads of good stuff you can sleep to this year as well.,0
Hi  does anybody know when Bon Iver will play?  My sister wants to buy a one-day ticket to go see him.,0
There's some speculations in this thread: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/lineupartists/roskilde_2012_play_dates/,0
Hey Roskilde  if me and my friends want to camp in camping area G and want to one of the first people there  which entrance should we then buy?,0

We are taking Festivalbussen from Oslo  and it stops at East entrance. However  we will be staying at Get a Tent downtown  and need to get to entrance West 2. Is there a shuttle bus from east to west before the festival opens?,0
No  but you can walk. Contact Festivalbussen directly though to get a clear answer if they might also stop elsewhere,0
Hello! We are a group of BA students writing a paper on smartphones on Roskilde Festival. We would apreciate it if you took 5 min. to answer this survey. Thanks a lot! ,0

Just got an email from Pukkelpop saying that Run The Jewels have cancelled their European festival summer altogether.. Please don't confirm this!!!,0
It could just be the final Euro leg of the tour they have cancelled. They have a completely crazy touring schedule  bringing them to EU three times this summer back and forth across the Atlantic.   First stint is around Primavera  then they return to the US for three dates before doing the Glastonbury/Roskilde round in the beginning of July  then BACK again to the US and Canada before returning to Europe for a third time in August. Pukkelpop is not before late August  so I am hoping that it's only those late dates that are cut.,0
It is ONLY Pukkelpop that's affected. NO OTHER EUROPEAN SHOWS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED.  https://twitter.com/runjewels,0

Well  fuck you. If you expect me to return  this ends. Now.,0

When the people with the entrance bookings are in. Usually goes pretty snappy (around 19:00 - Saturday),0
Hi Roskilde. How is the Up-town tent distribution happening this year. Will I be able to pre-book a tent like last year  or do I have to pick one when I arrive?  See you soon...,0
You'll get one when you arrive. Tents haven't been allocated to tickets/persons (although we are working on making a system for that next year  where you can choose your own spot when you book). The team out there will help you get a tent you'd like  but can't give any guarantees...other than that there WILL be a tent waiting for you,0
You'll need to exchange your festival ticket to a festival wristband at the normal entrances,0
It's sold out.,0
Less than a month until the release of The Tallest Man On Earth's new album. This new track from the album got us extra psyched about his #RF15 show.,8
Has Bruce Springsteen been removed from the line-up?,0
No. Why?,0
the alfabetical order might be messed up :P well if u search for artistst by the letter  B  he they didnt show,0
i found it in the end,0
He's sorted by his last name. Sorry about the confusion - and good you found it :-),0
I usually scoff at people requesting bands in here. But I am currently watching The Black Keys via Coachella's live stream  and they're nothing short of incredible. Just wanted to let you know :>,0
They are unfortunately booked for another gig in Copenhagen in august. Usually that means no Roskilde. Also  they aren't in Europe during Roskilde. 'd love to see them though.,0
You know what? These guys fucking rock. ,0
Can you give us a kind of a teaser before the big release next week?,0
We hope to find the time to do something.,0
NICE! And btw thank you so much for Malk De Koijn. Then we just need Machine Head next week :D,0
Roskilde Festival There are still coming a couple more acts right?,0
Probably not more than a handful  plus the acts playing at the Skate stage.,0
yeah think so... but still hope they'll come with one more good band...,0
Unseen Recordings met Aliou Touré of Songhoy Blues for a talk about how the band found a new musical path by meeting Damon Albarn and becoming part of the African-British artist collaboration Africa Express.  You can experience both Songhoy Blues and Africa Express at #RF15,5
Great show at GlobalCph this last fall! Recommendable indeed! BTW - will there at any point be an announcement of the bands/artists visiting Africa Express?,0
Hi Henrik. We will reveal more about the Africa Express show as we get closer to the festival. Stay tuned.,0
Acoording to your snapchat we acts soon. How soon :) ?,0
Hi Atli. We don't understand your question - can you please refrase?  :),0
Hehe sorry. Acoording to your snpachat we will get soon we acts. Animals name of the acts but how soon new acts :),0
Our Snapchat is a competition that is solely based on names that are already confirmed for this year's festival. We can't say specifically when the last few acts will be announced. But hopefully soon  ),0
Ok. I hoping for Blur and Official Motörhead :),0

Will The Confederation Cup Finals be shown on Big screen? :),0
I don't think so. Usually it's only the Euro and World Cup finals.,0
What about The screen at The skate scene  Like The final in 08?,0
What about the Tour de France??,0
No Confederations Cup and no Tour de France. Sorry,0
amazing work jonas  you made a really big progress :),0
Thank you Jonas Foss Elsgaard. We've just re-posted it.,0
Can we get copies of the newspaper at the Gylden Brød?,0
Hi Sridev. You should be able to find Orange Press all over the Festival area. Be it rolling around in the Orange wagons in the camping area or in a lot of the shops.,0
Thank you for the quick reply. I understand where the newspapers can found  but I would like some to be delivered at the Gyldne Brød where I eat breakfast. What can I say  I'm a lazy mother fucker. Also I would like wifi at the Gyldne Brød. By the way even if neither of these things happen  I am enjoying the festival immensely. I like the new area north of gate 5. Very nice.,0
New song by Florence + The Machine. We're very excited about the new album released in June - just in time for the show at #RF15!,7
Yes. If you bought two tickets separetly  then both are valid. One for West1 and one for East2,0
Hvem afløser the dillinger escape plan?,0
After the cancellation of Dillinger  we announced Devin Townsend Project.,0
You'll need your entrance booking when you enter the entrance booking area. At 18:00 when you get your temporary wristband  you do not need to show anything  BUT keep your festival ticket on you  since you'll need this when you later exchange your temporary wristband to a real wristband. Note: You can't enter the camping area without a wristband (temporary or real),0

The vote is now over and we proudly present the city arms of Dream City! Congratulations to the winner Jón Hallgrímsson and thanks for all the great submissions.,5
Congrats Jón Ingi Hallgrímsson! It looks really nice!,0
We dream about snowflakes and hammers in the city? Looks good but I just don´t get it.,0
The  snowflake  symbolize unity and fellowship and the hammers symbolize that it is the audience who  builds  Dream City - so to speak.,0
I for some reason relate the hammers to USSR  kinda a negative parallel to draw.  pretty tightly done though  I just don't care for it,0
Two thumbs down to the hammers,0
Two thumbs up for the winning city arms!,0
Congrats to the winner  but I don't get the hammers and the skyscrabers. I know it symbolizes a city  but the festival is made from tents(!!) Like Daniels Schmidt I also relate the hammers to USSR.,0
Well the hammers the skyscrabers and the  snowflake  represents all the things dream city is: that we in fellowship will build our own dream city on Roskilde 2012.  don't get how you don't get it..,0

Mew gives an exclusive first listen of their coming album +- at Bremen 22 April  which will include both interviews and acoustic versions.  We give away 10x2 tickets to this event. Tell us:  + Why do you like Mew? - Why would it suck if you don't attend this event?  Write your + and - as a comment below before noon on Wednesday.,3
+ Mew is an awesome unique band with an amazing sound. They always give something special to their live performances with their scenography .  - I might miss out on Mew during the festical since Thursday is packed with other great artist  :/,0
+ Mew blew me away  and topped a fantastic Bruce Springsteen in 2012.  + Mew is the reason I didn't sell my 2015 Roskilde ticket when they announced Paul Mc Cartney.   + I will go directly from Roskilde to see them at Skral Festival in Grimstad.  - I am not able to go to Bremen the 22.,0
I like me because they have been around since I was very young  and we've always listened to them in our group... It would suck because one time I was told we were going to a New koncert  which I was lolling forward to  then I found out that it was Duné playing - they're also good  but not in the same league  and I was so dissatisfied....,0
+ Best vocal in the world - My birthday is the 22 april,0
+Mew was i Big part of my life 2 years ago  when i went to bordingschool. their Music always remind me of the good times that year. - it would be amazing to relive that great year at their koncert. Just to see them live would be a great experience!,0
+ I like Mew  because thanks to them I 'discovered' the amazing country of Denmark  which ultimately became my new home :) - I haven't moved here only to listen to Mew on the radio. Also  I can't go to Roskilde this year  so it would suck to miss Mew,0
+ I've always liked and listened to Mew. I've never attended a Mew concert!  - it would suck to miss this awesome opportunity,0
First I loved Them because they dared to trust their own now wellknown Sound a Sound that changed the Music we know ! Plus the movies that support that special Sound. I would suck more than a lot that I as a fan from their poor start and a collector of their Music cant stand in first row.... With one of my old friend Henrik Noer WHO introduced Them for me,0
+ they give me a feeling i only can feel while listen to them. Its like therapy.  - if i dont go  it would be okay  but it could be nice to hear the new album  very nice  then I can hear them two times (Roskilde).,0
+:Suveræn lækker lyd!???? -: det vil sucke for vildt fordi jeg sindsygt gerne vil tage del af dette særarrangement!  (During my COFFEE BREAK... I surely dream 'bout lying on a BEACH on HAWAII  but since it's not holiday time yet I wish to WITNESS them on this SPECIAL evening and listen to the COMFORTING SOUNDS from MEW. Well let's see HOW THINGS TURN OUT TO BE!  If I don't win  you should SAY YOU'RE SORRY otherwise if I do win  then we'll be SUPERFRIENDS????),0
+Well my is the (comforting) Sound of my teens and some of my best relations includes Mew (biggest Them all my beloved girlfriend for the Past 5 years) - I can't make it to Roskilde This year so we doesn't get to se THAT show together,0
Michael Beck deserves it... Caus there are no bigger music fan on this planet... Its caus people like him the Industry are alive!!,0
I saw Mew the last time they played in Bremen. That concert will always stand as one of the best ever! And I actually go to a lot of concerts. They were so honest and talked about them being rusty after a long break of playing live. The humble attitude of these guys are simply fantastic. We saw them later playing Orange Stage. And no offense Roskilde  but the intimacy of that little stage  will always be in my heart. I would do or pay what ever  to re-live that experience ??????,0
+Mew is the sound i love - it sucks if I don't get a indoor concert this spring,0
+ Mew is hands down the best Danish band. Their music is simply brilliant. - Not attending Roskilde this year  so don't wanna miss this event as well.,0
+ I love Mew because their  older music (Frengers) absolutely helped me through some tough nights when I was younger. Especially Shespider and 156 has stuck to my heart..  - I haven't seen Mew live yet  even though I have been a fan for 7 years! Would love to see them and feel a part of their crowd,0
I love Mew because they composed the best song ever made! Comforting Sounds. It would such not to attend because the last time I planned to see Mew  at SXSW the show got cancelled because of rain. So I have a deep hunger for a Mew concert.,0
+ because I loved Mew sine their very first appearances on Det Elektriske Barometer and I still have the original versions of the first albums. The Sound of my entire twenties! - and it would just so much suck not to be able to hear their probably amazing new tracks as SOON AS possible. Would just love to be there!,0
+ I like Mew because their music reminds me of the boarding school where i found some of my best friends  and because of the great music of course. - I have birthday on april 23. and could not find a better present than a concert with such a great band  and of course i would bring one of the great friends the music reminds me off.,0
+ i love Mew because they make music in a way that no band has ever really done before. Their sound is in my opinion very unique. They have really been pushing the boundaries in the rock scene. They have in my opinion som of the best melodies i've heard. Their music touches me in a way that no other band has been able to.  - It would suck very much because i'm a huge fan i would really like to go.,0
+ Because they are something very special. Sometimes life isn't easy  and when I'm looking grave  Mew arrives in their small ambulance to give me a vaccine of 156 comforting sounds  which causes a Hawaii dream of me lying on a beach with Louise Louisa. Am I wry? No.  -)  - Beause I can't take Silas The Magic Car to Roskilde Festival this year :'(,0
+ Mew was part of my first roskilde experience and was one of the best experiences at the festival. My friend and I have seen Them everyone year ince! on all the Danish festivals they have played since!                        - she is not attending rf this year  so it would really suck if we miss the MEW experience this year!,0
+ I heard Mew for the first time when their song 'Special' came out ten years ago. I was 13 that time and I have loved the band ever since. Mew was something so special (!!) and odd  something that I really hadn't heard before. We used to come home from school and listen to their music with my friends. Every time I listen to Mew I still feel like a 13-year-old girl who is just about to discover the world of wonderful music. - It would suck because I wouldn't be able to tell my friends how cool it was to see Mew live for the first time.,0
My friend showed them to me  and i just loved everything about them! Their special style were just my sound  and thne i had the best summer of my life that summer! It was on a gymnastics camp and we had so much fun and listened to so much awesome music. They always remind me of those memories and that is why it would suck not to attend!,0
+Their music redefined the way we think about the danish music scene - I wouldn't be able to see Them warm up before the Big One on Orange stage  -),0
+ Mew has managed to stay relevant through many years already. Starting as the teenage fascination  but growing into much more with their complex yet accessible music. They have only produced extremely solid records so far  so why should this one be any different? - A special record needs a special setting. It will suit the first full listen a lot better at Bremen with friends  fans and frengers than alone at home.,0
+ Nothing takes me down memory lane like Mew -  I lost my virginity to the album Half the World Is Watching Me. The bad part is that both her parents and her siblings saw us doing it. felt like the album title at that point.,0
I don't remember the first time I heard them. I remember the first time I really listened to them. That was live at Roskilde festival in 07. I'm not ashamed to admit that. It was a great introduction. That's where you see talent stack up against a culture of recorded music. That's why I like Muse. It would suck not to see them because I can't make it to Roskilde this year. And it kills me. Also it's the day after my birthday? Give a brother a chance. Haha.,0
I like Mew because they are pussies and if I don't attend this event I don't know what else to suck!,0
+ The first time I listened to Mew  was when my parents bought their album Frengers back in 2003  when I was just a boy at the age of 10 or 11. Ever since  it has been my favorite Danish record  and I've remained a fan ever since  also attending several of their concerts. To experience them live and acoustic at Bremen would be an amazing experience!  - It would suck not to see them on April 22 since it is just a few days before I turn in my exam-paper  and a Mew-concert would be the ultimate break from writing.,0
I love mew mostly because thier music reminds me of being a child and remembering all the good time that was carefree. Also it makes me relax and think of what i learnt that day i am listening to it.  It would suck not listening to mew on the 22 april beacause i am not going to roskilde this year and that suck even more.. Beacuse i love mew's show on the Orange stage ?,0
+ Mew had given me a lot of new friends! I live their Music  because they unlike other bands keep on making good music.  - it would suck not to go  because i just have to!!!!,0
+ Mew absolutely changed the way I looked at music  in a time where I did not pay to much interest to music in general. So in many ways  Mew was the beginning for the fascination I have for music today. Especially comforting sounds makes every hair on my body rise and has the ability to make a good day better and a bad day less bad. - If I did not come to see this show  I would have one chance less of wining back the 10 crates of beer I owe a friend: We made a bet at a Mew concert in Roskilde. I would give him 10 crates of beer if Mew did not end the concert with Comforting Sounds. He would give me 1 crate if they did. They didn't and I still owe him many crates of beer. Hopefully  taking him to a Mew concert could work as a debt payoff.,0
+ because they're great  and more so on Roskilde - well  that'd be the same,0
Comforting Sounds  its not getting any better -),0
+Mew's music is the best and fits my complicated mood  I grew up with Mew right from the begining and can clearly remember how it was possible to contact them on their website via Netscape (^-^). - It would devastate me to wait another week to wait for their new album that for their new album when I know there is a chance for a sneak peak. So please take me into consideration!,0
+ I like Mew because they never stop growing. Back in the day  when the freaks and geeks had the internet to ourselves  the Mew-forum was a second home and a safe space for me through those awkward teenage years (oh  don’t pretend you didn’t have them too). But because neither Mew nor I got stuck in that period of time  we never grew apart  even though I became a stronger/wiser/different person  as it can happen with so much music that means the world to you at a certain point in time  and then suddenly  the appreciation fades to pure nostalgia. - I’m not going to whine  just say: gimme the new goddamn comforting sounds already.,0
+ Mew are so Special to me and their Comforting Sounds truly inspire me and makes me feel like I am sitting on the Beach on Hawaii. Whenever I have a Coffee Break I think about how Sometimes Life Isn't Easy but then I listen to Mew and it makes all My Complications go away. - If I will not be a Witness to this concert I will be needing a Vaccine and maybe even a Small Ambulance. Am I Wry  No - I just really want to go :),0

Mesure the noise of roskilde:  ,0
Are you ready to come  home ?  Just ONE MORE DAY of waiting... then we can start Roskilde Festival 2013.,26

Preparing for my 14th year... In a row. Coming home? You have no clue how right you are! ?,0
I am SO ready  you have no idea. I am leaving for Roskilde tonight and sleeping at a friends. Then we are headed out to you very early tomorrow morning.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HUV2ZKWJw,0
I have a ticket  I was just curious of how many tickets you have sold.,0
We just send out our scouting regiment  and tomorrow the great army of Mordor are ready to recapture L99! #CampMordor,0
I'm ready to sleep in my own bed again :-D,0
one more day? hell no  i'm coming today!,0
if Roskilde was my home  I would order a cleaningperson right away!  ) So  let Roskilde be a dump because thats what people want  and let our homes be homes  because Roskilde is not like coming home  it is in fact  leaving home to see the world! The  Roskilde Feeling  is that  not a feeling of home - thank you  ),0
It's my first time in Roskilde   So Im ready to see my new home <3,0
More than ready!,0
Casper Morgan Merrild  you still have time to buy a ticket - but don't wait too long.,0
If anyone is looking for work at the festival please write me. We are looking for 2 people (as we had two call in sick) the schedule is as follows and the task is to check armbands at gate 20 in WEST. Sunday 30/6: time 7-15 Tuesday 2/7: time 23-07 Friday 5/7: time 15-23 Saturday 23/7: time 23-07  Hope to hear from you  Karen (Roskildeholdet),0
Entrance West 2 (or just plain West if you arrive later than Saturday) is the place to go.,0
This would be really awesome! Imagine thousands of these in different variations at the festival! :D,2
korn....i know it...,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raPraAsj6s8  our www.bigwill.nl  just enjoy........ hope to hear from from you,0
Hey guys  will you have any screens up showing the rest of the European championship?,0
We've heard your concerns about the data policy  and we hear you.  We've now set up a data policy feedback booth in Rising City at the festival. It's open today between 17 and 19. Please come over and voice your opinions. Then we'll get back to you tomorrow.,4
No net! The Devine Mobile @ Peer Rene Larsen,0
You should not even have to listen  you should not be doing it  end of discussion.   One of your pathetic replies on the previous thread was  'For now we are merely making you aware that data is being collected. But remember: it’s like that at home  too. Your telephone company registers all your messages. Social media own your updates and photos. And search engines make money on your searches. So it’s not a Roskilde phenomenon – it’s just everyday life for all of us. Peace and love.'  You are not my telephone company.  You are not Facebook.  You are not Google.  You are not Instagram.  All of the above  as a user made a specific choice to agree to their data politics.   Can I ask you where you have asked people to accept yours?,0
Two comment's to the holy mobile texting and typing  tyranny  that never sleeps  and our bib bib world  with a net net non culture  that leaves nothing left to Donald Duck !,0
You dont have to use the free wifi. Its your own choice,0
See now... just that simple bit of information would have been great. The sign says nothing about Wifi.  But  thinking about it now  RF can not tap phone converstations without agreements with tele-co's etc  so I am thinking it is just a big publicity stunt for Snowden.   :),0
Are you having a campervan-camping this year as well? :),0
Hi Max  yes we will. Tickets will be available pretty soon. Stay up to date on our Facebook or sign up to our newsletter here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2015,0
Isnt that an EU directive? Nothing new really,0
Im going to work at the festival  and i know that i then with my work-armband can get into the different entrances at 1800  but is it only south 1 entrance i can get into? or can i also go into the sold out west and east entrances?? ,0

Look who I spy...  ,0
Can't say a specific time. When everybody WITH entrance booking are in  you're good to go,0
You have to print the ticket,0
Has someone in here made a Roskilde spotify list? If so  would you care to share it? :D,0
Dream City needs a city armour. We’ve picked the five best audience designs. The rest is up to you. Vote for your favourite! Deadline: 7 April at 23:59 CET,5
Can't say a specific time. When everybody WITH entrance booking are in  you're good to go,0
If you didn't manage to get Machine Head this year  I'll go on a personal rampage  destroying everything in a 1 35 meters radius.,0
1 35 meters... Are you going to drop your pants and swirl around  letting your 1 35 meters dick do the dirty work?,0
Well  that was.. weird..,0
Great news about the electronic stage! Haven't had the time to listen yet  but I'm sure it's great. My only worry is that this will lead to less electronic music on the bigger stages. Hove has Flux Pavilion  Knife Party and now  NERO. Hoping that you were way ahead of them on these bookings! ,0
Let me clarify: Apollo Countdown goes on during the warm-up days (hence the name). During the final four days  more established acts play on the stage  which is now called Apollo. In other words  there will be loads of electronic music at Roskilde Festival 2012. If we present bigger artists they will play the stage that suits their popularity.,0
:D,0
:D,0
We would love to be one of your travel partners to encourage people to carpool to Rockslide with Festival Rideshare!!!  What do you think???,0
I'm thinking  what on earth is Rockslide?,0
LOL... My bleary eyes messing up the spelling!!!,0
Anyways  please send an e-mail to info@roskilde-festival.dk,0
WE WILL RIOT!,0
Wagon? It's a proper stage :-),0
Isn't it supposed to be mobile in the warm-up days? Or have I missed something?,0
Mobile? Yes. A real stage? Yes! :-),0
I was just being colourful  ),0
Looking for a full festival ticket  send me a PM if u got one! ??,0
In less than 48 hours Roskilde Festival 2013 begins.   Festival-goer Martin Bentholm has sent us this cool video  presenting 42 years of magical festival history. Which was your favourite year?,15
I dont remember. Was it 2003 Metallica and Iron Maiden played the same year? It was amazing anyway!! I loved it!,0
1975 : Procol Harum   Ravi Shankar   Focus..... it was wonderful,0
1999! Outstanding line-up!!! = Metallica   R.E.M   Blur   Robbie Williams   Skunk Anansie   Suede   Marylin Manson   Wilco   Faithless   Chemical Brothers   Basement Jaxx   Manic Street Preachers   The Roots   Al Green   The Flaming Lips    Blondie!!!!,0
Im too old for 9 days of festival. See you all next thursday :) Best one was probably 1995 or 1998.,0
1997 with TOCOTRONIC in the red Tent!,0
2011  I met my boyfriend and we're ready for this year's festival to begin :-),0
Mattias Svensson hit the nail on the head with 95. Who can forget the epic hours in Arena with Sinnead O'Connor then Cranberries then Oasis? Magnificent  then after that The Cure at the Orange stage  best friday of my life! :),0
I have been to Roskilde since 2002  and without a doubt 2006 was the best year. So much awesome music that year and a legendary Roger Waters show to close Orange Stage  mindblowing concert.,0
My first year 2012. Björk  Jack White  Janelle Monáe  The Cure  tUnE-yArDs  Kellermensch  The Shins  Cold Specks  M83  Shiny Darkly.,0
1995 was a pretty great year. Jeff Buckley was amazing.,0
1979: 0:13 - Actually Dire Straits have never played at Roskilde because the concert was cancelled. It could be nice if Mark Knopfler would like to visit the festival! :),0
My first year 2005 with great performances from Black Sabbath (the reason I came)  D-A-D  Green Day  Foo Fighters  Audioslave...,0
2009: NI? (first reason I came)  Mars Volta (second reason I came)  Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds  Oasis  Slipknot  Coldplay  Trentemøller  Deadmau5  Fever Ray  Mew  Fleet Foxes  Yeah Yeah Yeahs,0
1997 looks AM-A-ZING!! Sadly I was only 15 months old then  and people dicided not to lend me ticket money. #bummer,0
2005 was a great year. My first year at Roskilde  and the lineup was pretty damn sweet :),0
0:37 – I made that poster :),0
Do we have to print our entrance tickets or can we just show it via. smartphone?,0
you have to print them,0
Small but beautiful... The smallest stage of the festival is ready. Welcome to Gloria.,5
Gloria is ready to enter that stage fo sho!,0
Anyone knows the music playing in the video,0
I want to buy a parking ticket  but the ticket wont come to my adress in time! So is it possible to get it as a mail i can print out instead? ,0
Hello Roskilde! is it possible to charg up a scooter battery at the festival if you have the charger with you yourself?,0

Looking for two tickets for Friday or Saturday!! Please inbox!!,0
Dear Roskilde   Please please please pretty please get Alabama Shakes as a last minute band. Their new album is the best of 2015 (go listen!)  I promise they wont disappoint. I see they are free between July 1st-4th. I will be forever in your debt!!,0

Tove Lo should play this year!,0
Pretty please with sugar on top: ,0
NWOBHM turns to NSEM (New Season of Epic Metal)  Summoned Tide from Northern Sweden  the Land of Meshuggah   with influences from Uriah Heep  Helloween  Iron Maiden and Queensryche. Some people compare Rickard with Geoff Tate  Kai Hansen and Bruce D.  http://www.reverbnation.com/artist/artist_videos/915029?sel_video_id=9535830&autoplay=1 ,0
After the release of the day-by-day programme  we're already figuring out the time-table and stages: http://roskilde-festival.community/topic5456.html,0
If you bring all the tickets  you get all the tents - located next to each other  if possible.,0
As far as I know people arriving by train will be guided along a path towards entrance West 1 and 2. They won't be let in via the train station Entrance.,0
As Anders Cold tells it is  are how it should be. But i'm quite sure that there are people running from some where   cheating  the lines at West 1 and West 2. If that's not the case  i can't understand how the entire camping site at west  are more or less full when I  and others that are between the first 1/3 of everybody at Entrence West 2  allmost can't find room for a camp for 10 people.....,0
Keep in mind that people tend to hog space a LOT. One guy can easily bring 5-10 tents with him. Also some areas in West tend to fill up superfast. B and C especially. Nevertheless  we've managed for 5 consecutive years to find space for a camp which has ranged between 20-50 persons in size at Camping West.  Also  the entrance capacity is a bit lop-sided. About 20.000 people charge the West side Entrances  while 20.000 comes from the East and up to 13.000 from the South. Since Camping East takes up more than 2/3 of the total camping area  it's bound to be more spacious over there even if you also have the South Entrance to factor in.,0
What Anders said.,0
We might do something.,0
When are the cars who have 4 or more people in them instructions on where the parking for ants carpooling ? I read that a email will be sent to the cars who qualify.,0
I sell my ticket for the festival (29june to 7jully) for 1000DKK. Interested? MP.,0
Good news for electronic music lovers. 20 upcoming electronic acts have just been announced to play on our new stage in the warm-up days (1 - 4 July).  Apollo is the name of Roskilde Festival's new electronic stage - in the warm-up days we call the new stage Apollo Countdown.  Follow link below to see who it is - or listen to one of the acts right here.   http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/apollo-countdown-stage-is-full-of-young-electronic-sounds/,8
Still waiting for the good news for metal music lovers - where's our new stage?,0
It's at Copenhell  -),0
I thought the electronic music festival was Distortion and Roskilde was for all genres? :-),0
Nice with some electronic acts Roskilde! Now is the time to announce the mother of all electronic bands - aka Daft Punk!,0
Underworld are just way more epic Live.,0
Flemming Iversen: So this stage somehow preclude Baroness  Behemoth  Cerekloth  Crowbar  Devildriver  Red Fang  Refused and all the rock acts from the playing the festival this year?,0
Jesper Buhl: Is there going to be an electronic music mobile stage or a metal music mobile stage at Roskilde 2012? Why not let the electronic music bands play at regular stages and give metal music a mobile stage? It's an obvious priority and no number of metal bands playing at the festival this year is going to diminish the simple fact that Roskilde at this point in time clearly favoritizes electronic music and that particular audience segment.,0
Flemming Iversen: Why is a mobile stage more of a priority than a regular stage?,0
In the warm-up days  you mean :-) A mobile stage in the warm-up period would be great for all genres - Roskilde decided they want an electronic music stage. That's about as clear a prioritizing as you're likely to get. And not a very surprising one in hindsight as this is the direction Roskilde has moved towards for years now. But that doesn't mean that the thousands of rock and metal fans (still) at Roskilde can't wish for a mobile rock/metal stage too. Just wish you'd admit to the simple fact that Roskilde IS catering more and more to specific segments. Which they have every right to  obviously. Just saying  is all.,0
Niklas  you know us so well :-),0
Roskilde how can you do this!!!! were are the stage for acid jazzbands??? this is so unfair!!!,0
Oh  the sharp wit of electronic music fans :-),0
oh i deleted that. But yeah i know you guessed F.O.O.L all those months ago. I also guessed Svenska björnstammen but i was wrong thank god!,0
Flemming: You're missing a point: Electronic and urban genres have been severely underrepresented on the Pavilion Junior stage so far  as opposed to when the festival really starts.   Also keep in mind that a setup with a full-blown mobile stage for BANDS is really tough to do on a technically satisfying level (= worthy of Roskilde's audience). The only reason Apollo is doable  is because the setups for the acts presented on it are sparse (usually a dj and/or mc). Thus  the stage itself can be really small. You wouldn't have that advantage  if you were to present a slew of bands with complicated miking  backlines etc.  In the end  the advent of the Apollo stage also benefits the Pavilion Junior lineup from your perspective. It weeds out the electronic/urban acts from the Pavilion Junior lineup  and thus you have more room for rock.,0
Looking through the list now and this looks great. Glad to see two groups representing Iceland there. Looking forward to checking out the new stage.,0
Saying that electronic music is prioritized is nonsense. A good reason for why we see a stage with purely electronic music is simple in my book. Did any metal fans (or indie fans or pop fans for that matter) take the time to put up a camp where people where invited to come and enjoy the music? Spend thousands of kroner and a lot of time just to hear the music they like? Have a huge party every single night with literally thousands of people showing up? No  the electronic  community  did and roskilde saw the potential and the need for an electronic stage. That simple.,0
Mads - look at Anders Cold's post. If it was as simple as setting up a turntable/cd-player/Macbook then it would have been done. But it just isn't that simple.,0
Of course that's a factor as well. I'm not blind to that. They do it because it's possible. It's the complaints about electronic music getting a stage  for free   if you know what I mean  that I'm a bit upset about. Some people decided that electronic music should be a part of roskilde and really went for it and as I see it  these people are being rewarded now. Would roskilde have done this if it wasn't for the big camp parties?,0
Mads: It's a valid point.,0
Thinking of booking an early flight from Kastrup monday morning. Is it possible to get to the airport after the last concert sunday night? By train or bus? ,0
Absolutely. It'll be busy but possible.,0
I'll bet it will be awful :P But as long as it's possible! Thanks for quick response!,0
Get NERO for Orange!!! Would be the most insane party ever  also new album coming soon - so that would be perfect!,0

Roskilde Festival hope you guys make update on the full festival ticket before it's sold out....I wanna buy soon so the update is neccessary,0
You're good!,0

Ryan Bass  music from three upcoming stages - Rising  Apollo Countdown and Street. That plus LOADS of other arts & events activities,0
Why?,0
Anders Cold  we ran out of those bullets  it seems,0
But couldn't you maybe try and get The Mountains and Myrkur to collaborate? I really want to hear it now.,0
Johnny  it's all in their hands :-),0
Been there done that - Emilie,0
How so?,0
apart from wednesday I think it's pretty neat,0
Hi Amy. It's too soon to say but usually early afternoon. The schedule with set times will be out around May.,0
Perfect thank you. Just don't want to miss kygo :) appreciate the quick reply,0
line-up per dag,0
We like!!!,0
yea  you keep track of that.. then i'll keep track of you :D,0
Choices seem quite erratic and the genre's are too spread  for me anyway.,0
Same!!!,0
Do it,0
i agree with Peter. I'm a little bummed out. Trying to stay open though  and hoping for a few good last minute announcements.,0
Oh my goooooddddd !!!!??,0
D e Veronica maggio,0
Florence and the machine  spiller samme dag som muse,0
One of the best line-up in years  if you ask me...i'm going eclectic! :),0
Oh my gawd!,0
Have you even been to Roskilde Festival before? Diverse acts is kind of its thing.,0
???? bloody headliners divided up over each night! (I mean it makes sense  but it kind of sucks too!). Mathilde what are you thinking? We so badly want to see you girls too though! And explore CPH! We could do some laid back exploring on Sunday  and we'll stick around Monday and hang out Monday night? Then leave Tuesday morning maybe?,0
Ah disclosure would have been nice but we will make the most of it with what we got ??,0
Maybe discover some hidden gems that we might have otherwise overlooked. Optimistic!,0
Will likes first aid kit as do I! Jamie xx is there he is good. The random tents will be good fun ??,0
I don´t think I will join u on Roskilde but I am def up for meeting up sunday  and let´s see if we can get monday off as well :) Can´t wait to see you <3,0
 genre's are too spread   what year was it not this spread  if that's what you prefer?,0
Seriously if you can't then we won't go to Roskilde every day because we really want to see you!!! That's our priority! We'd like to get the best of both world but if it comes to the crunch we wanna see YOU! ??,0
But I would be lying it I didn't want you to try for Monday too ?????? haha aw guysssss I'm so excited to see you again!,0
Same,0
(y) (y)  PPPP,0
godt sagt  begge to,0
Saturday  the final show of course Tom Mullumby,0
Fredag d. 3 Juli babe  ),0
There's plenty of rock music. The amount of metal acts is pretty much the same as previous years. You have got to dig into the material :-),0
the war on drugs antemasque and king Gizzard for thursday.. but it's not headliners if that is what you're looking for.,0
From one metalhead to another: Roskilde Festival isn't a metal festival and you (plus everyone else) would do well to finally realise this. If you want a metal lineup  go to a metal festival instead and quit complaining. You're making us all look like a bunch of entitled little babies.,0
...and besides that: The festival has some pretty serious metal acts booked anyway. Enslaved  Piss Vortex  FOSSILS  Pallbearer  Mastodon  deafheaven  Tombs and even Lamb of God  if you're into that sort of thing.,0
There are still a handful or two missing. No-one major though.,0
Roskilde sure isn´t a metal festival  but don´t you agree that have become less so in the recent year? It is hard to ignore that they actually had Metallica and Iron Maiden not too long ago and most years have had at least one or a few big names.,0
People say exactly this about the lineup every year  ) (and I have been there the last 11 years),0
Yes I see it has sold out,0
Yes  but be prepared to camp far away from the stages. Best chances that late into the festival is in agora P.,0
Yes  there are concerts 28.  29. and 30. june too  but these days are the warm-up days  where you cannot buy one-day tickets. This day-by-day breakdown is mostly a service for those wanting to buy a one-day ticket to catch just  that  band.,0
Brilliant! Will buy tickets either today or tomorrow  Daniel Peris,0
Roskilde will never be about the big bands..... And thanks for that ??,0
2006 was the last year they had a somewhat organized lineup.. imo,0
Die antwoord  G-eazy  Kendrick lamar  dj mustard  run the jewels  paul mccartney  kevin gates. bruh am i about to block you?,0
well in the 80s they didn't have any edm  rave or britpop acts. the times they are a-changing!  if you want some proper rock music in denmark  come see the dictators on the 15th of may in cristiania and then you can go enjoy roskilde after that :),0
in what way was it  organized ? was there a general theme? one genre was dominating? fewer nationalities represented?,0
Lasse Tærsker Isaksen (Y),0
Lamb of God + Nicki Minaj = weird line up,0
Maybe Copenhell is more to your taste.,0
Peter: In 2013 it was Slipknot + Rihanna. Contrasts rule!,0
Peter Baker: weirder than Opeth + Steve Angello + Anousha Shankar + Parliament/Funkadelic?,0
sorry meant to tag @Magnus Raevenlock,0
Harry: Roskilde booking bands who actually try to move the genre forward  as opposed to simply going for the low-hanging fruit by booking only the three or four old dinosaurs still moving?! Yeah  I fail to see how that can ever be a bad thing. Ever.  I acknowledge what the bands you mention have achieved and what they contributed to the genre when  they were in their prime  but honestly  aren't they sort of the thing everyone has seen several times by now?! Let the Kanyes and suchlike pull in the big ticket sales and with that pay for bands like Enslaved and Piss Vortex - bands which WILL blow your mind.,0
This is gold omg,0
During the first days of the festival we have 3 stages playing with Scandinavian upcoming acts. Exciting stuff. Moreover  we have a full arts & events programme going on around the campsite. Lots of stuff to get involved in - and if you ask anyone who has been here before  they'll tell you that you really shouldn't miss out on the first days. They are an integral part of the full Roskilde experience.,0
What you do is you go party in your camp. A lot of small parties are going to be there in between camps  so the  warm-up  days are actually just as awesome as the real concert days :-),0
Thanks for the replies :),0
Don't worry  we will. We're selling lots of tickets these days  just so you know.,0
Omaigaaa!! :O,0
What Anders said,0
Mette and Helle says hi. First in line in West. They came yesterday and are in a good mood  though they might be running out of C batteries for their ghettoblaster soon  -)  In East camp Total Viking Power has been chilling in line since yesterday as well -> http://instagram.com/p/bB91xjFeSt/,112
Tell Mette and Helle not to worry. Heime Twinass will arrive later today.,0
Well  that's retarded.,0
Our camp will be arriving tomorrow... Im supprised that Fri Ost arent the first in line this year,0
Talk about overdoing it,0
Mette and Helle SAY hi.. PLURAL!,0
Temmelig dedikerede alligevel :D,0
Absolutely insane. See you Saturday  like normal people!,0
using C batteries for at ghettoblaster sucks. please think of the environment! use re-useable car batteries! ... oh snap! they are not allowed anymore....,0
Good thing they arrived so early seeing as the line behind them is that long. I'm wondering: It isn't legal to camp outside designated camp grounds in Denmark. What would happen if the police came by? Would they be fined and asked to move away?,0
Hello  girls. See you later today. We'll bring music  beer and stuff. Do you want us to bring anything else for you?,0
wait!! thats my spot!,0
...and please do not panic now. There's room enough for everyone with entrance booking in the line(s)  and lots of spots for tents. The pic is just meant as a greeting - if you show up tomorrow or Saturday (before 18:00) there will still be room for you in the line. Some people just can't wait  -),0
God stil tøser :-D,0
Mette and Helle  if your phones are running low on power  please let us know! We are right around the corner and would be more than happy reload you guys :),0
hardcore :D,0
Love THE festival - but all you that come  PLEASE remember er are some that live here.,0
How much do you wanna bet that they won't even get the best spot anyway?,0
Will we have to stand up for the last 2-3 hours again this year due to lack of space in the waiting area?,0

I'm gonna try again! :-) Hello Roskilde! On the map on your site  I saw this thing  which to me looks like that it has something to do with fishing. Can we fish as much as we want in this sea  and which kind of fish do you have in Denmark or in this sea? Hugs from Bosnia,0
Don't know about which exact fish there are in it  but yes  you can fish in it. It's a lake though  not a sea. You can either rent gear or bring your own,0

Anyone selling a one day ticket for Friday?,0
Is it just me  or is the forum on the official roskilde website gone?,0
Want to volunteer at #RF15?  You can sign up to be a part of Roskilde Festival 2015 now. Read more and sign up here: http://roskil.de/rf15volunteer,99
When do you expect to start the sale of caravan camping tickets?,0
Nope  that simply means that you don't book an entrance - period. Meaning: if you plan to arrive at a later time. Because entrance booking is only valid during the first evening.,0
But the options for the 9-day ticket... Therefore it kinda does work  doesn't? I mean... You can't deny me access to the festival  when the ticket says from 30th to the 8th  even though it's a  without entrance booking ??,0
We won't deny you access. You just can't get in first if you don't have an entrance booking. It's as simple as that. And it's needed because thousands upon thousands arrive on this first day.,0
Uhm... There's something odd about your message. If I can't get in first  then they're denying me access  which they can't - see? Kind of contradictory  but I think I know what you mean (well.. no actually). But thanks for the answer  and you might want to look into that  because it does look like a kind of a loop-hole  if you ask me hehe.,0
You won't actually be denied access. You would just have to wait until the queues consisting of people WITH entrance booking are emptied out  until you could get in yourself. At least that was what RF practiced last year.,0
Allow me to slap them all :D,0
Looking forward to Roskilde?  Here's a little treat for you all from Camp Mordor. They sure look ready for #RF13,52
A question. Im blogging for Spirit  a norwegian musicmagazine and Roskildefestival gave me a free ticket I could pick up at the presscenter. My friends have booked pre-enterance tickets for WEST2  and I want to join them. When is the presscenter opening? I hope it opens before saturday 18:00 so I can get inside at the same time as my friends.,0
Haha Benjamin Abildgaard-Jensen :D fucking sejt!,0
Hands down sygeste track ever!,0
Thumbs up  årets roskilde sang :D,0
Is camp Barad-Dur ( Saurons tower ) gonna b there this year as well??,0
If you are talking about camp Mordor then yes.,0
can i haz this roskilde?   ,0

Why? There are hardly any queues on wednesday anyways.,0
Whats this shit? Reserve the right to rape my privacy? Where are your roots Roskilde?,0
Don’t worry. There’s nothing at Roskilde Festival that doesn’t happen every day where you live. It’s normal for big organisations to collect  register and occasionally pass on the messages we send on Facebook  Messenger or as text.,0
Just because it happens dont make it right!,0
Kenny Traving This is nothing new. All nations in the EU have to do this.,0

So was I. It was awesome,0
cool! i really wanna see them  maybe i can someday in the future at roskilde :),0
That wont be released until sometime in june. They will release the DAYS the artists will play next week I think.,0
Mattias i think they will release it all together. No point in releaseing the days with out the time...  ),0
That's what they did last year though. Play DAYS  no times and then a couple of months later  a complete schedule with times on it too :),0

What?,0
Hey RF - care to explain this?,107
Hey Mads   We cannot open your picture. What are you asking?,0
Hey Mads  For now we are merely making you aware that data is being collected. But remember: it’s like that at home  too. Your telephone company registers all your messages. Social media own your updates and photos. And search engines make money on your searches. So it’s not a Roskilde phenomenon – it’s just everyday life for all of us. Peace and love.,0
hahahahaha you guys already share all the data on facebook...so what...they will just gather a lot of   where are you?   ...  did you survive from yesterday?   ....  are you drunk now ?  ...  lets hear RhCP? ...,0
Well. after more than 20 visits to this great festival it's time to say FUCK YOU.   This is unacceptable in so many ways and a clear contradiction to The foundation on which The festival was build.   Shame on you.,0
So.. I haven't read the entire thread  but I did read Orange Press and I must say: Well done for putting focus on this subject. I often feel privacy and personal (Internet) security is neglected in the public debate. I can't wait until Tuesday to see/hear Snowden talk!,0
We've heard your concerns about the data policy  and we hear you.  We've now set up a data policy feedback booth in Rising City at the festival. It's open today between 17 and 19. Please come over and voice your opinions. Then we'll get back to you tomorrow.,0
The most impressive thing is that so few will bother to think about whether this is technologically possible from RF's side and ask the question of  how   or even the question of  why . Love the poster  the insulted festival-goers and the pokerface responses from RF fb managers. Looking forward to mr. Snowden.,0
Would have thought that's illegal in Denmark without court order or something.,0
If you want the picture  just search in your database for 'mads tinggaard pictures' ??,0

Hahahahha lets welcome them to reality hahaha ??,0
I had another  interference  with RF and I must applaud them for their work. This is purely a stunt to raises awarenes for data privacy and I sincerely hope people who read this and aren't on the festival think twice about the posts they publish and only share data they feel comfortable with the whole world is knowing - those includes personally data(selfies  and other).   Please think twice about who the intended recipient is!!!,0
Hahahahaha   We're Listening  ... And watching. Tak  big brother ??????????,0
Yes  I would definitely like to know why and how!,0
That's not what the sign says!,0
Point being: the poster should be seen as a provocation  raising a discussion on privacy through targeting the individual festivalgoer. RF is not gathering your data. Go see Snowden. Have a great festival :),0
Why set up a feedback booth? You can just listen in while people call or text. Can't see why you would like to go through that hard work..,0
Beg to differ. By working with telecompanies and the masts they have around RF  this is possible  and more so. The reason the information is gathered  is mainly for development and research purposes. RF is by far  the largest temporary gathering and  city-like  festival environment in the world. Making temporary surveillance points  gathering non personal data and analysis this gives valuable insight to big companies about festival goers  youth and how temporary infrastructure can be used to support and aid the world in many different ways. It can also be used to improve permanent infrastructure in cities.  An example of this  is IBMs information gathering from RF 2015: http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/cloud-data-rocks-out-roskilde-festival  This is just ONE partner and possible use of the data gathered :) So hope this clarifies the questions in your comment =),0
But after reading the thread  this specific post might be trolling advert for Snowden interview... lol. But data (albeit non private!) is being collected at RF =P,0
Interesting! That's the kind of information I was looking for. Do you think the content of text/phone conversations are included in this type of data? As far as I can tell the link you provided is an opt-in application for iPhones  users would install in order to share information  not a programme where all communication through masts was shared. http://www.slideshare.net/HenrikHammer/roskildefestival-big-data,0
Lukas Bjørn  This might be the case. I haven't looked at it so closely. But still  the point remains  that if they get the cooperation from the telecommunication companies  it wouldn't be a hard thing to do to collect all the information (non encrypted of course  as someone on the thread comments that encrypted communication would be the way to go to avoid the data collection). But it may not only be the  cell mast  communication used. GPS and WiFi relayed communications and positions  how many cellphones were in a given area at a time with WiFi  and so on =) The possibilities are endless  and pretty much all of it will be non personal data gathered  otherwise it couldn't be used for research purposes :),0
Indeed  those possibilities and issues are super relevant  and the access to the masts would be the main point of interest in this discussion.,0

The Roskilde Music Festival  a huge week-long rock concert starts this week in Denmark. In 1992  the Columbus Quincentenary  Roskilde honored the American Indian by inviting a large group of Indian dancers  musicians and artists to be part of the festival. It was a blast  wish I could go back some day.,0
oh! If only...,0
what a worse !,0
fun idea but too obvious,0
oh yes its the first of april....otherwise this might be an excellent income for roskilde festival makers.,0
Well  you should!  -),0
Nice try making a april fools' joke  guys! For one moment I thought you were serious...,0
Well  you should...stop giving out those plastic pocket ashtrays  they are everywhere  We do not use!,0
this money should pay tobacco corporations  and not visitors smokers who pay the tax on tobacco,0
I actually like the idea  though the logistics would be impossible...nice one :-),0
I was expecting you to announce Bob Marley  Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix as acts  but this is much more fun  ),0
Haha April fools! You certainly got me!,0
Too bad its the first of april would be awesome if it was implemented,0
Close but no cigar.  -D,0
very good idea for a sustainable Roskilde,0
very sad to find out this is april fools... even though it would be impossible to search everyone for cigarettes  it would be great if something in this direction would be done.,0
Hahaha nice one - 1. april love that day!,0
As also Roskilde Festival proudly presents Michael Jackson and freddy Mercury singing  Nothing else matters   from Metallica in duet with Rammstein:-) ...of course live on orange stage:-),0
... yeah  it's april 1st  but(t) actually a good idea (naaah)  since every cigarette-butt has to be removed by hand during clean-up after the festival. So the smokers (including me!) should be more disciplined about this. :-),0
 Butt tax  Hahahaha :D:D,0
Put out more ashtreys!!,0
10 euros per pack of smokes? That's harsh  but I get it  they can always get it back. No? They have to give up at least 5 euros  even if they pack all of their butts in little trays and carry them with them? This is a good aprils fools  but I really don't understand why people would want to double the price for smokers at the festival.,0

Well i guess it's a good way to put some focus on the subject. But anyhow i don't care because i roll my own cigarettes  ),0

All the more time to look forward and get excited.,0
Mathias Hoffmann  this is only done as a last-minute thing because people can't receive their tickets in time.,0
I'm well aware of that :)  I am just wondering why print@home tickets haven't been an option from the beginning...,0
You are missing the point! Why is it only done as a last minute thing? You should have made it possible from the begining. The ticket is expensive enough as it is. Now you are just screwing with the people that bought it months ago!!!,0
print-at-home-tickets results in more fake tickets..,0
Well  hopefully the money we spend on having the tickets send  will go to the danish post office. Which we all know is having a hard time making  since nobody is sending letters anymore. And whats 40 DKK to support a good course?,0

I've been in a lot of festivals but never saw one where people run to get the best spot for camping. It doesn't even get any shade so the  I'll try to get that spot because it has shade in the morning  isn't even a thing.,0
The amount of trash just dumped on the ground. Y'all need to encourage better treatment of the land.,0

Can you tell us which day Lamb of God are playing? Several months ago  they announced that they were playing on 3 July so we bought our one day ticket then. Later  they announced that they will be playing on 27 June and if you look at their website  both days are listed. It might be possible that they're playing both days of course  but it's a little bit confusing so we would appreciate a confirmation. Many thanks.,0
Thanks  that's what I thought too  but this is copied from Lamb Of God's website just now:,0
There aren't ANY bands playing the 27th June. 27th June is the very opening day of the festival. Unless Lamb of God are willing to soundtrack a drunken horde racing over the campsite Oklahoma land rush-style  it's the latter date of the two. Theoretically they could be playing any day between 1 and 4 July  but since they say 3 July themselves  I'd count on that.  Roskilde has stated that play dates will be announced after Easter  so you'll have it set in stone in a week or so from now :-),0
This is the 2015 poster!  Who is your favourite act from the #rf15 line-up? Tickets: http://roskil.de/rf15ticket,93

19PM is probably optimistic. They don't let anyone in until the queues of those WITH entrance booking are cleared and 10.000 people at each entrance takes a little while even if each person is through in ten seconds flat  -),0
But in theory  it would be possible?,0
If all the queues are cleared  yeah. I think they take their time to reconfigure the entrances also though.,0
Nope I did'nt. But now I have.  I understand you need a bank which can handle your specific kind of activities (festival) but I am surprised if Danske Bank is the only Bank capable?   Well  its good to see you are taking all this into consideration and we are looking forward to the evaluation next year where you come to the conclusion that other banks are! capable :)  If not so - you are all forgiven.,0
No answer last time so we try again :)   Hey!  How much of the B camping area will be  off limits  to those of us NOT traveling with festivalbussen? Which areas in particular?  Just 3 more days!   The question is: Will we be able to get a spot on camping area  B  or is the whole area booked for  Festivalbussen ?,0
Found out right now:  We're simply talking about one camping square - so there'll be plenty of space for you.,0
You bet!,0
Yesterday we revealed the line-up for Roskilde Festival 2015!  Now you have the chance to ask our bookers about the line-up. We will be ready to answer as many questions as possible between 11.00 and 13.00 on Twitter. Only two rules to go by: 1. Only one question per tweet 2. Use the hashtag #AskTheBookers,3
Should we use @orangefeeling as well?,0
Why no Daft Punk?,0
Hi there   In lack of Twitter-usage  I  too  will be asking (and hoping for a reply) on Facebook: Now  I haven't been throughout the ENTIRE lineup yet (it'll happen soon enough)  but I can't seem to find any real post-rock. And obvisously  I'm thinking of Godspeed You! Black Emperor (who's playing ATP Iceland during Roskilde  having free dates around the festival)  will they be booked  or was it just not possible to make it happen? Will any other post-rock band get booked? Other than that  you've got some stellar names on that poster!  Thanks  and with kind regards  Mikkel,0
#AskTheBookers  Hi. Did you concider booking the british band Alpines? If no  have them in mind for next year. They are amazing and upcoming.,0
#AskTheBookers Are you going to get one more headliner before the festival this summer ? you will make lot of people happy if you will book Blur  new album and festivals shows this summer :),0
Martin  you don't have to. We will find your question using the hashtag.. But if you can fit everything into one tweet  you're more than welcome.,0
Try to ask your question on Twitter - our bookers are ready to answer all your questions!,0
I no have Twitter :/,0
Jonas  they have been pretty clear about the fact that they aren't playing live. Time will tell if they will return to playing live.,0
Thanks. I hope you do whatever you must if they change their minds  ),0
Hi Mikkel. No  we haven't considered booking them. Try Warm Graves  Deafheaven - and perhaps Einstürzende Neubauten :) Thank you!,0
Thanks for the answer! I'll surely be watching Deafheaven (literally cannot wait!)  still warming up to Neubauten. But I haven't made my way to Warm Graves yet  will do so ASAP :),0
Hi Mikkel. We know them  but we haven't considered them for this year's line-up.,0
Så meget system of a Down!!!!! ??????????,0
SOAD  make it f*cking happen!,0
Nicolaj M. Reugboe,0
Ok. Danm but still i can not wait for my Roskilde Festival nr 16 in the row :),0
OH GOD SYSTEM OF A DOWN,0
OMG System of a Down!! :O,0
The Roskilde Festival 2015 line-up in numbers.,32
What is the male to Female ratio?,0
When you say  acts have been announced so far  does this mean that us people listening to rock & metal may yet be satisfied?,0
76% have never played at Roskilde before? Respekt!,0
How many people disappointed with the line up? (% or numbers),0
Rachael  and Malky- good things to know about Roskilde Festival this year ????????????????,0
Malte  we still have a few more acts. Can't say anything about genre yet.,0
Roskilde Festival It's more than I knew 5 minutes ago  thank you very much for replying! I'll stay optimistic :),0
Yeah the rest were announced earlier,0
Hi Marttis. We will have to do some counting and get back to you.,0
 52% are announced when the poster is revealed on March 26 ,0
You guys will never be satisfied  ),0
are there any bands that sound heavy in other ways than just using a lot of digital distortion and gargling  screaming ?  (the lineup is awesome by the way  i don't really expect and proper hard rock at roskilde so don't worry!),0
The wording is maybe a bit confusing  so let me clear it up  since I am the guy behind this: 48% of the 166 names were already announced before March 26th. The remaining 52% were revealed today. My apologies for any confusion I may inadvertently have caused.,0
Martin: Fossils might tickle your fancy. They're a duo  bass and drums  and they're heavier than your mum.,0
Are you serious right now??? Who gives a damn? It's Roskilde  will you enjoy the festival more if you know there are more females playing? Please sod off,0
24% has .....,0
I'm glad you're asking this question  and it's really quite funny how people are reacting so negatively just to the question being asked. Like really. Calm down people  take a deep breath.,0
Ulrik* This has literally been asked like the last 5 years  there is always some feminazi getting there panties in a bunch  instead of picking up a fucking instrument!,0
Sex  race and age doesn't matter  I couldn't give a damn about any of those matters as long as they can get on the stage and play their heart out.,0
Muse and Florance and the Machine. What's to be upset about?!,0
Malky Bee Check it out xx??xx,0
Why do people get so defensive when a question about gender comes up?   Roskilde is all about the music  the genders of the musicians isn't important  the feminazis has gone far enough!   Do you think it's equally bad that they show us statistics about what countries the acts are from? Or the age?  Has Roskilde sold their soul to the  internationazis  and  agediscriminazis  because of this?,0
Hi Marttis. The numbers are: Male bands 69% Female bands 18% Mixed 13 %  These numbers are based on the following: Solo artists are defined by the gender of the (yeah you guessed it) - solo artist (not the backing band). Bands are defined by the gender of their members (either all male  all female or mixed).,0
Thank you Roskilde Festival! I think the trend of a more diverse lineup is going in the right direction. I know for a fact that It's more diverse than the average since 06 on arena&orange.  Have a nice weekend!,0
elle som jag frågade tidigare:  Has Roskilde sold their soul to the  internationazis  and  agediscriminazis  because of this?,0
isn't Nicki Minaj some sort of trans?,0
Martin*  Yeah i think it would be completely stupid to put music into boxes of age  gender  ethnicity or sexual preference! I actually think that it demeans women  and people of other race  to start putting artists into boxes like that  it treats them like some sort of handicapped  that need extra help!  Diplo has been picking obscure music genres from South America etc  for the last decade  but he is white?! so what if the quota is not met  do Roskilde then have to say no to him? and get a native Brazilian instead?   Imo its far more racist or chauvinist to do things like that  instead of just listening to the music  and let the fucking music decide!,0
Note that my numbers aren't exactly the same as Roskilde Festival's own numbers. That's because I counted myself and included acts with a male singer and a mixed backup band in the mixed category. Roskilde Festival put those in the male category.  You're welcome.,0
Why do people care? Music is music  doesnt have anything with gender to do.,0
Clearly it does. Eventhough it souldn't.. How else would you explain that only 16% of the acts are female? Is it because women are bad musicians? I think not.  Im not saying that RF are aware of the discrimination  Im saying that they haven't been  but they should.,0
Who are the trans acts?,0

If you ever trust weather forecasts  this one predicts pretty good weather next week.,244
perfect! not too hot  but some sun. very little rain  which is good 'cus some is needed to keep the dust down and the air nice. hmm  hoping for this one! :D,0
It's been  overall  very good since 2008 where my brother and a good friend started going with me :),0
It will be great if Roskilde has decent weather  it makes the festival even better.,0
I do not hope i'm jinxing the forecast by leaving my umbrella at home! :),0
Actually - that looks like PERFECT weather. A bit of rain is nice - then you don't have to blow dirt out of your nose a week afterwards.,0
Christian Pawlowski: Nooooooo! Don't do that to us!!!,0
I'm looking forward for saturday just The same Way i used to when christmas was near :D Hope that everybody gonna have a fansastic week. Looking forward to see all of you beautiful People!!! :),0
What a Jinx!,0
Best of all its cloudy  which keeps the nights warmer! This way you dont wake up in a 70 degree tent  with all your clothes on!,0
That forecast have been changing every other hour for the last few days. Just two days ago it was going to be all rain all week long. I'm going to wait a few more days before I go fully woohoo,0
http://www.yr.no/place/Denmark/Zealand/Roskilde/long.html this says something diffrent.. atleast thursday,0
Looks awesome! :D Hopefully it will hold up.,0
Maria Steen seee! :-D,0
Jinx of the fucking century...,0
yeeey Tuva Rønning:D,0
A bit too early to tell but its looking very good. Around 20 degrees is perfect. Not too hot and not too cold.,0
100% of the people voted  more rain please ...,0
Wouldn't mind a few more degrees of heath,0
No burns  no rain  no wind. Perfect!,0
Knock on wood!,0
forecast is like rolling the dice.... just wait till next week ...,0
I just bought a damn rain-kilt! Show me some dark clouds,0
Kom så vejr!!!! You can do it!,0
#orangefeeling #RF2013 hope you are right about the weather!,0
Never trust the forecast!,0
Yeah  two days ago DMI predicted 16mm rain across the two first days of warm-up. This is a reoccurring thing... Each year DMI will say about 1-2 week before warm-up that it will be raining  then less than a week before warm-up DMI changes their mind to sunny weather. Usually then at first day of warm-up they tell us it's gonna rain either Wednesday or Thursday.  The pattern is there.,0
I recommend Accuweather. They are right like 80% of the time  whereas DMI is more like 35% :P http://www.accuweather.com/en/dk/roskilde/125902/weather-forecast/125902,0
I recommend looking out the window.,0
Daniel  that's what we're going for as well :-),0
We know. Couldn't help it  though.,0
:-) even if rain would be fallin  Roskilde Festival has the everlasting sunshine in it's heart....,0
That's how it works. If you don't bring it  it WILL rain.,0
Frederik Bøgel Hansen  nope  it's the real thing. Check yourself if you don't believe us: http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/til-lands/byvejr/by/vis/DK/4000/Roskilde Danmark,0
is it possible to trade tickets with friends  even though there is a name on the ticket?,0
Rage Against the Machine  Kellermensch  Slime  EaggerStunn  Malk de Koijn.,0
http://soundcloud.com/djmarbeck1/set-march-2012-by-marcelo free download.. enjoy..,0
Soundgarden is still possible on the 6th as far as I can see:  - Chris Cornell is not playing with either Soundgarden or solo.  - Matt Cameron is not playing with Pearl Jam. He plays in Berlin on the 5th and he is going to Stockholm on the 7th.  - Soundgarden is playing on London on the 13th  and have not played since June 10th. They surely need a warm-up gig!   Roskilde July 6th!!! ,0
Now that Sonisphere is cancelled: KISS and Mötley Crüe!!!!! Bring it on  bitches!!!,0
Chase and Status igen <3,0
Hi all! This year I will go to ROSKILDE I am looking to meet people who travel to Roskilde this year. NEW FRIENDS! SOMEONE Available this year :) ,0
Dates will be announced after easter. The complete program is usually released in june a few weeks before the festival,0
We'll let you know after Easter.,0
Yes  you can bring a bike. Keep an eye on it  though!,0
It already exists: http://clashfinder.com/s/rf13/ A guy on the forum made it. If you find any mistakes let him know: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/lineupartists/clashfinder_make_your_own_schedule/,0
Since you havn't answered yet i'll try again: Roskilde Festival I was one of the lucky winners in the competition aranged by Ants  so now i just wonder  will my parkingticket i won be able to use in the Park N Pay at East or where will the parking for us with Ants-vouchers be?,0
There will be a special Ants parking area in the Free Parking Zone closest to the festival,0
Roskilde Festival: Just to make sure and not throw my money away  I will still be closer to the campsite if i decide to pay and use the  Park n Pay  next to Entrance East instead of useing the Ants parkingspace cos' that's still on the other side of the Caravan Camping.,0
Looking forward for Roskilde 2013. But have hoped yazoo have been there this year but sadle not.,0
Don't think they're playing much together anymore  unfortunately.,0
They was reuned in 2008,0
Dear Roskilde. We're aiming for a camp in the upper part of G  but if our own music and talk will be lost in the music from the Apollo Countdown stage  we'll move further down.   How will the sound of the stage affect the upper part of G?  Will the stage and crowd be located in the direction of the camping area  or in the direction of the Bridge?  Thanks!,0
The stage faces East and is backed up against the treeline along the railroad. The map should be updated to reflect exactly that.,0
Okay  I've only been looking at the map in the app. Do you have any idea how loud this stage will play? If facing east  it's sound waves will hit the food area from 5 pm - ??  each warm up day  right?,0
As far as I can see in the app  there will different food stands  fx Brazil  Aladdins kebab and Delleboden. So I'm not thinking about city center west. If we don't want to be bothered by the music (bad Roskilde-spirit  I know)  should we move down to G67-72-ish?,0
Yes. It usually takes some hours :),0
Ruuuuuuuuuun for your life,0
Its a stampede!,0

 In a statement of their own  Queen have revealed that they are looking for an alternative venue for their set with Adam Lambert:   We are disappointed to hear of the cancellation of the Sonisphere Festivals as we were very much looking forward to performing with Adam Lambert and particularly as the venue was Knebworth  our last stand with Freddie. We apologise for the disappointment to all those who were looking forward to seeing us. We are working to see if we can redress the situation at some other venue.  -   Så er det fandme nu!! Samme weekend!!,0
Soon Roskilde Festival opens. Watch the live Facebook stream at 4PM.,20
http://www.safeconcerts.com/news/2012/mar/7104-sonisphere-festival-cancelled.asp This festival was going to be in the same weekend as Roskilde  now more chance to get more rock bands to Roskilde :),0
Please get something of these bands to Roskilde :),0
or all of them...,0
Yeah that will be cool but Marilyn Manson will play Copenhell in Copenhagen but i hope the Roskilde booking team are booking these bands :),0
Cypress Hill  Incubus  Katatonia  kvelertak and Faith No More! that would amazing!,0
I would like them to get some of the goth metal  especially Within Temptation  which was great at RF in 2004 and even better in Falconer last year.,0
I think we have to get more metal/hard rock this summer  last Rob Zombie cancelled his Roskilde concert,0
and Mastodon!,0
Mastodon will play Copenhell in Copenhagen,0
The big release is the 19th of april,0
and after that date about 20-30 more bands will be added to the lineup,0
Not touring during Roskilde.,0
Hope ya like this too!,0
Wolfmother and Flogging Molly  please :),0
Hopefully not  this festival doesn't need any more dinosaurs.,0
Hahahaha.... Juicy J can't!!!,0
I saw White Stripes at Roskilde in 2002,0
Out of juice? No  problem. We have four good options for you:  1. GET VOLT: Buy or rent a special mobile battery from Volt. When it’s out of power  you can exchange it to a fully charged battery – again and again. Buy before the festival at a special price - DKK 99 (approx. 13 euro - normal price 27 euro) + a deposit of DKK 200 (approx. 27 euro) which you will get back when you hand in the battery again. Volt has booths at Apollo Zone and in CITY Center East & West. Go here for the special pre-festival offer -> http://getvolt.dk/en/  2. RECHARGE FOR FREE AT 3 If you’re looking for a free recharging service  head towards phone company 3’s stall  located in the Apollo Zone at Roskilde Festival. They’re open all week.  3. RECHARGE AT THE LUGGAGE STORAGES We offer several possibilities for recharging of your phone at the festival. At all luggage storages you can have your mobile recharged for DKK 10 (approx. 1.5 euro) – you just need to bring your own recharger.  4. Lose your phone and get lost in the kindness of strangers.,24
Does volt charge ipad 4 ?,0
Cant find Xperia V (not Nero V) on the list of supported Sony phones?,0
We build our own - recharge everything! ,0
screw phones im on festival. take a break and be offline for a week wont kill you,0
@Per you can charge your Ipad  its a batterypack - so just connect your cable to the unit and Ipad.,0
Yeah.. But some iPhone chargers do not have enought (milliamps) ? To charge the ipad. Just like some USB ports can't run a USB only hdd or charge iPads.,0
I'm quite certain that it can actually charge it. The problem is more likely that the battery doesn't hold enough juice to actually charge your iPad sufficiently. And considering you can only swap your battery twice a day  I woulnd't be too sure if it's the best option. It might get you some of the way but depending on how much you'll need your iPad  I would give it some thought.,0
 Volt battery has a capacity of 2000 mAh at 5V.  Volt homepage.        In the iPad's case 2100mA - 2 1 A.   –  info from a forum post. So no it does not charge iPads.,0
OK Found it - f*cking brilliant!! http://getvolt.dk/saadanvirkerdet/,0
We made it a couple of years ago. It can recharge everything that uses USB.,0
Our battery will not give your iPad a full charge! It will give it between 5-10 percent maybe more maybe less depending on use  iPad version and so on :),0
Louis: Nope. Only if you have phone that needs a really rare type of charger,0
Kasper A. Rasmussen: As long as your phone is charged via a micro-USB  mini-USB or iPhone connectors  it will work with the Volt battery.,0
How about ipOds then? =) Would I be able to charge my ipod Classic? My phone isn't an iphone  so I'm not sure about this but they use the same usb cable don't they  so I'm asuming that's a yes?,0
Its USB in the other end.. So just bring your own cable.,0
Never mind... on your web page when I have to pick my phone model I can actually pick  ipod ... however! Even if I order for my Sony Xperia this means I can still bring my own USB cable for my ipod and use it to recharge that as well  correct?,0
I think so yeah,0
Option 4. Find Camp nQrd (the quys in silver/astronaut suits). We have a 12 car battery charging station (primarily for our sound & light).  You'll find us at  P . 8am: go for the sound of Coal Chamber - Rowboat  1pm gummi bears/bubbibjørnene in 21 different languages  23pm-? the funniest technoparty in East/P.,0
For people with Windows Phones  a roskilde app  ,0
I have a ticket for the full festival for sale! Any takers ??? :),0
Awh Yeah! This Spotify playlist is hosting the FULL Roskilde Lineup as of March 26th! Go listen to your new favorite acts right NOW! Well  at least every act present on Spotify  that is! Tell me if something is wrong (wrong tracks) or if something is missing (new releases after march 26th?) and I'll try to correct it! Thanks  ) ,0
Thank you so much for DIE ANTWOORD! so foking excited!,0
Hva me nået kpop? :D :D :D,0
Will be good party @ Roskilde Festival this summer :) ,0
I think its better this year than last year,0
i found maybe 4-5 bands i wanna hear... rest is either shit that doesnt fit in to roskilde or not my kinda music..,0
I went through all the posters throughout the years  and yes  I concur  it's the worst in 7 years. I'm cancelling my ticket purchase.,0
Its a music festival for all genres. Like its always been.,0
Thx for the answers :),0
Simon is not entirely correct. Usually you can get in later on Saturday evening  when all the queues have cleared and the entrances have been reconfigured.,0
Please note that without entrance booking you enter through the normal gates at the festival  not through the entrance booking waiting area.,0
Never lose a call or a tweet again.  Yep  we're calling it. This year's mobile and WI-FI coverage is going to blow the roof (in a good way  that is).  Say hello to a fine-tuned FestivalNET Wi-Fi  and a massive increase in mobile coverage and capacity compared to last year.,46
That's just sick... (in a good way),0
Wicked! Which operators will have cell phone coverage?,0
Those cell masts  are they used by all Danish cell providers?,0
But remember: With great power comes great  emptying of you cell battery  (but we might have a few solutions to that in your stream later today),0
Wi-Fi is not free? Come on...,0
Tried wifi last year. Didnt work at all. Waste of money.,0
Will it be free to log on? or do you need a code?,0
Is there no Wifi at the Caravan Area ?,0
No coverage on caravan?,0
Whats the price?,0
So where to pay For this service?,0
Get-a-tent downtown should get free wifi access as compensation for replacing it to the shitty place.,0
So  if you camp on the other side of Køgevej (like Caravan)  we're still as f***** as last year ??,0
Do I need to logon every time I'm close to a hotspot  like in most airports  or is it automatic like a home wifi?,0
https://www.festivalnet.dk/buy is not working? I cant pay?,0
The beers aren't free either. Sorry. We have great costs setting this up.,0
3 worked great last year for me.,0
It's be much better this year. Promise.,0
So... maybe it's HEALTHY?,0
All of them.,0
It'll cost you a little (DKK 35). And you will need a code  yes.,0
I guess I'd rather see the costs for services covered by the ticket. But that's your call of course.,0
What's the price then?,0
35 a day  or the hole stay?,0
35 - for the entire festival.,0
We’re offering Wi-Fi – wireless internet – for all festival-goers. The price is DKK 35 (approx. 5 euro)  and then you’ve got internet throughout the festival week. However  you need to be close to our hotspots to go online.,0
Yeah  no love for us... :(,0
Ronni: So you suggest raising the ticket price for everyone so that those with smartphones can get free wi-fi? Yeah  somehow I'm not seeing that happening.,0
Morten: There'll be coverage (mobile). Both from some of the larger mast at P fx and from some of the masts postioned outside of the map (normal masts being there all year).,0
Maybe I should have been more specific. I was thinking about the wifi.,0
Andreas Uhlmann: You just log on to  FestivalNET  when you're close to a hotspot and a logon/payment screen will pop up  or you can buy a voucher at the Information at Gate 10.....or you can just get it here right now -> www.festivalnet.dk,0
Sofie: 35 DKK for acces the whole festival,0
I bought it last year but couldn't log-in so a waste of money :(,0
Johnny: That how they do with a lot of other stuff  music  toilets  camping. So yes.,0
Joost Boschman  just been to the place. It's actually a GREAT place. You'll see.,0
Morten: Unfortunately not this year. The cost of supplying it  all the way  over to the caravans  and make it work on the large area  was to high. This year at least :-),0
Well at least you considered it... Let's hope for next year (and that the mobile network will provide sufficient 3G coverage),0
That will depend on how your phone is set up.,0
Janus G. Öregod: No Wi-Fi for caravan this year unfortunately. The costs of building it and setting it up to cover the caravan area was to high. Maybe next year.,0
Claudia Jäger: This year the volunteers that build it have been polishing and testing it all winter  so it will work. We promise.,0
Carina: No Wi-Fi for caravan this year unfortunately. The costs of building it and setting it up to cover the caravan area was to high. Maybe next year.,0
Kai: No Wi-Fi for caravan this year unfortunately. The costs of building it and setting it up to cover the caravan area was to high. Maybe next year. We still love you though :-),0
Björn Andersson: We just tested it and it works in this end. With what and from where are you experiencing problems? What happens?,0
after I have completed everything and press the completion payment  it will see a box that says payment was declined,0
Björn Andersson  are you using a VISA or Euro card? (and do you have money on it),0
i am using visa and yes there is money on it,0
I´ve got probs to pay with eurocard aswell,0
I'm sure the terrain will be fine  but the location is isolated from the festival. Last year's and the originally intended location allowed for some daily 'disaster tourism' through the other camps without taking detours...,0
Mirco and Björn: Thank you guys! We sent some techs into the machinery  and found a bug in the system handling transactions behind the Wi-Fi setup. Non-Danish creditcards seems to be the problem. They're working on it right now  but it could take some hours  since it not in our systems (but in the payment systems). Thanks to you we found this bug now  instead when the festival was full on :-),0
All of which is a necessity. You don't need to be able to update your facebook with pictures to impress your friends  but you need to able to take a dump and sleep.,0
Rikke Jonasson: Through festivalnet.dk (note: Not working with non-Danish cards at the moment  due to a bug. Working on it)  or just by logging on to  FestivalNET  when you're at the festival,0
Also some music would be seen as a necessity I guess :D,0
Its in a much better location this year than last year. Thanks for moving it,0
The 3G signal at the caravan site worked flawles last year... maby you cen get 3Mobile to sponsor a bunch of 3G Routers for the caravan site  as most og visitors here from outside denmark. for us danes this is not a problem...,0

Should be possible to find your tent with these designs  ),0
When is the t-shirt competition finished.....or is it?,0
We've picked our favourite sticker design. Congratulations to Jens Appelberg whose design will be a real sticker.  But we loved all of them. Thanks for the submissions. Here you can see 30 of our favourites.  Which one do you like best?,14
When does the winner of the Sticker design competition found? :),0
Roskilde Festival presents the 2015 line-up! 166 acts from 32 different countries in all kinds of genres.   Do not miss the party of the year. Get your ticket here: http://roskil.de/rf15ticket  … and a few more acts will follow before the festival.,926
any live streams on announcements or something?,0
One hour guys!!!! I am counting the seconds with my bottle of redwine! Today is a party day :) :) :),0
Hey Roskilde Festival. From when can I change my ticket to a wristband..? Is it possible already this coming Saturday? If so  where..?,0
Ok  so Sunday might be better for me then. Is it at the normal entrances or at the building at Davrupvej? Or both? Roskilde Festival,0
Just go to the main entrances at East or West.,0
Me and my friends bought the ticket to the festival along with 2  tuborg summer packages  each  and we've all got the ticket for the festival sent home to us  but none have seen any proof that we have bought the beer. Neither any emails  except that we have to show ID.  So how do I get my beer?,0
u should most like recieve a pdf-file with the beer tickets which u have to print out urself... at least that's what I did  if u havnt recieved that file I am afraid that I cannot help u m8,0
thanks  then I really have a problem. Cause they sure havnt sent me any pdf about that!,0
No less than 14 acts have been announced for our Pavilion Junior stage. Go check them all out.  Meanwhile  we're working hard on preparing the lineup release (along with this year's poster) for 19 April. Live video stream at 16:00. Can't wait!,9
You are really holding back on the  real  line-up this year. But if the idea is to make the event on the 19th even bigger and more interesting than usual  then you're succesful :) Hoping for an amazing presentation  so the festival can get sold out and surpass this years great result  and RF will be able to support even more great causes.,0
Dennis Erichsen  with a lineup as huge as our (approx. 200 acts) it's important to give the smaller acts time to shine as well because upcoming music is an important focus at Roskilde Festival.  That being said  we hope to present small and big on 19 April.,0
I completely agree Roskilde  and I'm usually not the impatient type  just feel that less  bigger/normal  acts are presented than usual  but I may be wrong. I love the Pavilion Junior koncept so I have no dislike towards todays announcement in particular.,0
I hope for Waldo & Marsha  Darling Don't Dance and Den Fjerde Væg as the final Pavilion Junior acts. Would make my festival.,0
Philip  the Pavilion Junior tent has capacity for 2000 people and even more outside. It has never been a problem before. It wasn't a problem when Jooks or Slagsmålsklubben played. So come and dance those worries away.,0
Well  I recall the handicap ramps got smashed during Slagsmålsklubben  because people were jumping on everything!,0
thanks a bunch for BÄDDAT FÖR TRUBBEL - i've been wishing for them for a couple of years now. oh and girlseeker makes me happy too. now  can we have new the First Flush?!  http://soundcloud.com/first-flush,0
French Films! Kiitos  tusind tak  thank you!,0
Mikkel Gulmann Madsen  that's not a capacity problem. That's an construction/attitude problem  I'm afraid.,0
Elli Furuholm  glad you like them. French Films is a very cool band!,0
i love your replies Roskilde Festival  always so calm and sensible and danish.  ,0
Katie  that's us! :--),0
If you want to repeat all the good things from Slagsmålsklubben-concert. You really should consider booking Trio Tetris from Finland. Kinda same kind of music with live drums and bass. And they´re very good live.,0
Wallu Valkama  this year we have other kinds of good things to enjoy.,0
Ok  that´s fair. Maybe next year then  ) And thanks for French Films  they´re a good live-band too.,0
thats super awesome! however  you should also consider booking M Ward. since he is touring europe around roskilde and has a free spot after the 30th of june..  DO IT!,0
Well  if it hadn't been so crowded people probably wouldn't have been on the ramps anyway.. btw  would love to see SMK at Roskilde again sometime! Looking forward to Klumpen og Ras Money this year,0
Hey you said that you would also announce an icelandic artist for the pavilion junior stage ! Please tell me there's more coming !,0
Where did they say that? I only think they said they would announce an Icelandic artist a couple of weeks ago. That was Dead Skeletons.,0
If case you missed it.. 5 hours of Roskilde - The Experience 2011 has been released on YouTube! :),0
NOO  not what I need now! I just decided to sleep!!!,0
Oh btw.. it's in 3d  )    but you can turn if off by pressing the 3d button :P,0
Ey Roskilde  Leftfield has a new album! If you book them I promise I will buy a ticket!,0
Watch this piece of smile-inducing ROSKILDE LOVE!  We're jumping the gun: Pede B & DjNoize are playing Roskilde Festival 2015.  Further 84 acts will be announced tomorrow at 08:00.,91

Roskilde Festival I was one of the lucky winners in the competition aranged by Ants  so now i just wonder  will my parkingticket i won be able to use in the Park N Pay at East or where will the parking for us with Ants-vouchers be?,0
 Scandinavia is a sanctuary for many of the good things in life  and Roskilde is one of those institutions which embody that spirit at its fullest ,0
please  you have to book the black keys!!! ,0
They aren't in Europe during Roskilde  unless they extend their tour about a month backwards from August.,0
BOOK SBTRKT! they're in europe during the festival and they have no concerts on the 5th or the 8th!,0
but that was some sort of dj-set and sbtrkt wasn't the main act then. magnetic man was.,0
Just listen to Malin Garhem.,0
you heard him ^,0
Also SBTRKT is one guy. not  them . Very unlikely he'll play this year  even though last year's performance was a DJ set he was billed as SBTRKT,0
same shit  different name röv... bla bla.  and no  it's not impossible :),0
Foster the People are touring USA during Roskilde. Black Keys similarly aren't in Europe until August  where they're playing in Copenhagen and at Way Out West amongst other places. Who are Rage Against? Do you mean Rise Against or RATM?,0
mean rise against offcourse  sorry,0
Searching for parking ticket east!!! Please write ASAP!! Much needed!! :D,0
We've got a little greeting for you from our booking committee ahead of tomorrow's line-up release!,16
Nicolaj D. Sørensen,0
So it begins... #RF15,0
I am very pleased that you have booked the devil.,0
What an amazing message. At least you care  win  lose or draw tomorrow after the line announcement  you have a believer in me. SO LOOKING FORWARD TILL TOMORROW.,0
TL DR Livestream @ 08:00 tomorrow - DK time.  Definitely didn't need to read about all the emotions you want me to experience. Thanks though.,0
Blur  Black Sabbath or Judas Priest and The Who :),0
The chemical brothers,0
Daftety Punkety here we go!!!,0
Malte Lykkeberg Ringström imorgen !! cant wait for it,0

Sophie Laframboise Nicklas Rønning Stine Måseidvåg Adam Rusnak Anniken Sunde Frich  LINE-UP RELEASE!!!,0
i won a roskilde festival ticket for traveling by joinants  and i'm just wondering if it's possible to order entrance booking to this free ticket? ,0
In case you don't receive your ticket in time  bring your receipt + photo ID and you'll get a new one on site.,0
Can I get my ticket printed out at billetlugen in Parken ? :),0
I have ordered without entrance  since that was booked :),0
You can NEVER be sure that a ticket is real or not if you buy from a private seller. Buy from www.billetlugen.dk instead if you want to be sure,0
refill these!!,0
They're all gone. Sold-out.,0
that's why i said refill :(,0
I'm sorry to say but your festival app is P.O.S. which force close shortly after start. I have Samsung Galaxy S2.,0
True on some Android versions. We are trying to flush out the bugs atm using the crash reports we get in from the many  many different Android devices. Android's never a smooth birth (for us at least). Sorry for the trouble. Hopefully we have it fixed by the next update. If all fails  try to uninstall completely and reinstall. If it doesn't work in the next few days  send us hatemail :-),0
I've already tried that. My fingers are crossed. :-),0
Can someone explain how I get that free transport sms? Never got it to work last year..,0
Please get Jack White....he is in Hamburg july 5th...:,0
Line-up release tomorrow at 08.00 (CET),22

Frankie goes to Hollywood ??,0
Celina uha uha :O,0

The Libertines  Tame Impala  Blur  PJ Harvey  Super Furry Animals  Foo Fighters  Beck  Elbow  TOOL  Perfect Circle  Radiohead  Witchcraft  Graveyard  The Strokes  Death Cab for Cutie  Arcade Fire  Dinosaur Jr  Soundgarden  Pearl Jam... please!!,0

Seriously? Who did this?,0
That is exactly what this means.,0
Splendid then!,0
Captain obvious strikes again (y),0
The full line-up or??,0
Christian. Almost. Like past years we might add a few more acts after this date.,0
Hi June. The schedule isn't ready yet. We'll start by announcing the line-up. Afterwards we will let you know who will play when...,0
No,0
Hi Morten. Why not? The line-up is ready  and we are super excited about sharing it with you guys. Why wait?,0
So you can spend your well-earned March money on the ticket instead of a night out in town,0
...which I'd gladly do if I hadn't already bought the ticket :),0
Don't count on The Horrors. They played last year.,0
Anders they had a gig in copenhagen in december but they had to cancel so i think there's still a chance,0
Som 100 new acts or so?,0
That's not the gig I am talking about – they played Roskilde last year and haven't done anything new since  so there's zero chance they will show up. It wasn't a particularly good concert either – massive sound problems and a band that hardly looked engaged  sorry to say.,0
When are we getting tickets????,0
Yes i know they were at ros  but they said they would come back to denmark soon enough after they canceled their copenhagen gig so.. They were still good  probably just high as kites.,0
pretty sure it's 8:00 AM..  Roskilde Festival..?,0
haha. You're pretty right Eva. Missed the PM part of the question. Sorry. Will correct the answer.,0
Hi Morten. Not quite. But a lot.,0
Jenny Death now,0
Noel Gallagher was announced a while ago,0

Well  what do you know... yep! Sal bietjie môre check! :),0
sooo stoked  tomorrow is gonna be a good day all round ) ),0
Thank you Roskilde....Awesome lineup!,0
Somebody jizzed on that poster!,0
Is this the final release?,0
Coming to Denmark  Chris?,0
Anna plan is to be in Europe the whole Month of July.,0
One can dream.,0
Friday is ALMOST sold-out  If you're planning on visiting Friday 5 July  you should buy your ticket NOW: http://ow.ly/lDLxw,29
This year I pass Roskilde.Been visiting since 92 but this year Swedenrock had a better line- up.(Rush).I think it's sad that much money is spend on Rihanna but what do I know I am 40 and like Rock.:-) See you next year(I hope),0
Why the frown? It's not sold out YET - go buy while you have time.,0
The thing is that  my friends Siyemay Abraham Ping Go Si and I  are travelling the 4th of July  so im not gonna make it the 5th and i im gonna see Rihanna..  And thats why its sad!!! :(,0
Feel free to think so - and go see something else instead. Good thing we have lots of stages.,0
I think it's sad that you can't see that Roskilde spend money on Airbourne  Turbonegro  Metallica  Volbeat  Queens Of The Stoneage  Kreator  BRMC  Suicidal Tendencies  Hatebreed  Devin Townsend if you are into rock :) But what do I know  ),0
Johan - I've been a regular since 1985 - this is the closest I've been to pass Roskilde - only - and this I emphasize - only because of tradition I bought my ticket. It is the worst line-up EVER.,0
Rihanna is not good quality music.It is like fabricated fake music.It´s like Roskilde would book One direction,0
Awright  Johan. But the festival has also housed people like Aqua and Robbie Williams  who both arguably are just as 'fabricated'. We still lived. As Peter Kure above you says  go see The Blue Angel Lounge instead.,0
I love Roskilde for sure.I will be back next year with hopes for a more rock line-up. -),0
Roskilde Road Trip's first stop turned out to be a great success!   10 creators  120 co-creators and 1200 participants transformed Oslo into a fourteen day long creative mecca.  At the final party  where Deathcrush (N)  Nelson Can (DK) and 120 Days (N) treated us with sweet music at the concert venue Blå  over 250 people participated.   The Showcase displayed Roskilde Festival inspired skateboard prints  paintings  graffiti and not to mention a fish made of wire!   Can't wait to see what Lund  Stockholm and Berlin decides to create!,5

Hey Roskilde! Do I need to print out my ticket? Is it at all possible for me to show it on my mobile phone? I currently don't have access to a printer and I'm on my way to que up! Hopeful regards,0
Here are the organizations who received the profits from last year’s Roskilde Festival. YOU made this possible.  Thank you so much for being a part of Roskilde Festival. See you at #RF15,71
What exactly does  Chill As A Cucumber  do?,0
Why ticket prices rise every year? To collect more money to be donated?,0
My heart jumped a beat when I saw a Roskilde poster with the words  rage against  in the top left corner.,0
great thank you for the arrogance  ) If you had googled the name yourself  you would have noticed that there is no reference to the charity among the results  not even if you add the word  charity ,0
It´s a local event crew that organize chill out events.,0
^Exactly. It's a small place in Roskilde that organize a chill event in the summer.,0
The name is kinda cool.,0
Because every thing gets more expensive over the years. You might have noticed this when you shop for groceries and such. In Denmark the cost of living generally rises about two percent a year.,0
Well they don't rise EVERY year either. They have been stationary the past two years and in 2010 it even took a slight dive.,0
You are not alone,0
IF there's a treasure at the end of the rainbow  where would this be at? Better bring a shovel.,34
Hey!  How much of the B camping area will be  off limits  to those of us NOT traveling with festivalbussen? Which areas in particular?  Just 5 more days!,0

Roskilde Festival i hope Blur will come to Roskilde this summer :),0
Hello Roskilde! On the map on your site  I saw this thing  which to me looks like that it has something to do with fishing. Can we fish as much as we want in this sea  and which kind of fish do you have in Denmark or in this sea? Hugs from Bosnia,0
I don't know the exact rules or what kind of fish that reside in the lake  but yes  I think you can fish as much as you want. You can bring your own gear  but you can also rent fishing rods on site.,0

After many years of regular camping at Roskilde I am concidering trying a Get A Tent this year. With the weather in mind  I wonder how waterproof the tents are. Do you have an answer for me? E.i. infomation about the water column preassure (vandsøjletryk),0
@Ane That's a good question... Not quite sure about that. For other info on Get A Tent see here: http://www.billetlugen.dk/product/26/get-a-tent-downtown/15/,0
Well  I have already visited that site. Not much info there. Doesn't it say so on the tent?  I'd really like to know  so I don't drown in an eventual storm flood  ),0
There wont be any flood. Promise! :),0

PLEASE GIVE US JUSTICE (the french elec-duo  of course)! As far as I know  they still don't have anything booked for the first days of July..,0
They're playing the Northside Festival instead of Roskilde. I don't think they'll be able to play other Danish festivals  probably due to contractual clauses. If they all of a sudden were announced for Roskilde  it would fuck up Northside's ticket sales massively  so usually in countries the size of Denmark the festival work in clauses that the bands won't play anywhere near.,0
Schedule is usually made public a couple of weeks before the festival. There is an unofficial forum thread of play dates here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts//roskilde_2012_play_dates/  Unofficial as in: Dates posted by the artists themselves or their booking agencies.,0
When do you announce new names? :-D,0
When is the next act announcement  Roskilde Festival? :) Soon I hope! :P,0

It shouldn't take more than a week for the ticket to reach you  but if it doesn't you simply print out your receipt which you should get via email and bring that along instead.,0
Forgot about that  yep!,0
Dropkick Murphys have free dates around Roskilde. I hope we will get them this summer :),0
i would like them or flogging molly,0
Design a Roskilde sticker and win two tickets to the festival! Here's one contribution.  Follow the link for rules: http://bit.ly/wZVtpw,11
Jonathan  that's up to you.,0
Mads  I think it says more about your imagination than the design  -) ,0
Maybe it does  let's hope people can't see it !  ),0
Will you guys be posting the other entries as well?,0
Følger lige op på Mads' kommentar ang. hagekortset. Sakset fra reglerne:   •Orange. The more  the better. Pantone 151c / 151U is the festival's official orange colour. The secondary colour is white  and black is only to be used in very moderate amounts.   -),0
Emilio Bernard  we plan to do a 'best of' gallery. Katrine Lyck  feel free to submit as many designs as you want. But we recommend that you put your creative energy into one design. Jonathan Mastrup Nielsen  we prefer vector graphics  but the depends on the idea. Plus  not everybody knows what vector is.,0
On it ! :D Is it allowed to use anohter nuance of orange (or another color)  if the ones described still represent the main color ?,0
Michael Andreassen  you can use other nuances but we prefer the official colour. It all depends on the design.,0
I want to come and see Paul McCartney with Sam Wilkinson and Sean Henderson,0
Hello! Can't buy ticket from Russia for a week. Is it ok with your ticket-site? May be there are another ways to buy it?,0
Use the official ticket site only. Clear the payment with your bank.,0
I can't open the site from different devices,0
When do You announce which days the artists are performing? I can't find it on your website yet  or am I just looking the wrong place?,0
It used to be a couple of weeks before the festival. Last year it was in May  but they changed it more than they used to do up until the festival.,0
Hej Per. We can't say yet. But hopefully around the same time as last year.,0
See ya soon! Much love to Danish Sugstuge & Politi =),0
When do you expect to put camping tickets on sale? I have seen mid March in a comments  but they are still not available?,0
They will hopefully be available around the 1 April. But keep your eyes on our Facebook - then you will be sure to find out,0
Den Sorte Skole [officiel side] played Roskilde the very first time in 2008. What a party!  Catch them (again) on 5 July at 20:30 on the Arena stage.,7
I can t be there,0
I really hope they'll be playing their Lektion 1 and 2  their Lektion 3 is good but it's not as  party minded  as the others. In my opinion atleast.,0
working at arena this year  this is a treat,0
Insane! What a party! Roskilde bring it on!!!,0
Expect a LOT from Lektion III and much less from the other two. Their latest shows have been based around that:   http://soundvenue.com/musik/2013/05/spot-festival-den-sorte-skole-global-a-go-go-47860  http://gaffa.dk/anmeldelse/72265,0
Yeah I have seen them twice since the release of Lektion 3 and have been kind of underwhelmed with it live. But I think that's just me  because my friends seems to have been enjoying it.,0
I'd be more than astonished if they hadn't made a special set for Roskilde and the Orange Feeling - I really don't think there is any reason to be worried  ),0
Tried to post in the forum (I was logged in) but when I pressed publish the system wanted me to login again... Anyway here's my question. Is there a walkway / underpass from Westside to the Get A Tent Downtown area? There is a marked road on the map that crosses the Holbaek highway just North of B34 (Street City)  but is that the way to go? Also if I arrive by the festival train  can I get my wristband at the festival station?,0
There is a tunnel that connects GAT Downtown to the rest of the camping area  yes. If you look at the map  it looks like a fork of Darupvej (keep on going straight north instead of taking a right and walking towards Odeon). I guess that's the exact road  you're talking about.  If you arrive by train you will receive your wristband at the station  unless you arrive already during Saturday the 29th of June. That day people who go by train will be directed along a path across the camping area to wait at Entrance West 1 or 2.,0
Super! Thank you for your rapid response Anders Cold!,0
Hello Roskilde Festival!  Does anyone here know about a job at this years festival for a person under 18 years old? I'm looking for at job for my brother  he's 17 :),0

So here it is Roskilde - due to the worst line-up ever  Next year I'll do both Glastonbury and Rock Am Ring instead. Here is some of RaR's line-up: Paramore Bullet for my Valentine The Prodigy Papa Roach The Killers Biffy Clyro Green Day Simple Plan Bad Religion,0
Hahaha those were all shit. Get with the times  bruh.,0
only band worth seeing among those are the prodigy. roskilde this year is going to be the best  also it´s not all about the music you know,0
Live there for seven months. Turkey amateur artist. plays guitar and sing. I want to make the festivals. Thank you for your interest ,0
Cloud Nothings and Jack White please  that is all!,0
How about Gramatik? I guess he has to come to Europe sooner or later,0
Thats what I call  pitching a tent !,0
Here's some trivia for you:  Orange stage consists of about 1 100 m² tent and of 1 378 m² stage floor  incl. loading ramp and more. The two big screens on either side of the stage are 54 m² each. On the stage  there are screens covering 100 m². There is 350 000 watts of light on the stage  and 175 000 watts of light among the audience. Additionally  there are 98 so-called moving heads on stage and approx. 100 among the audience. The sound system has a total capacity of approx. 300 000 watts including delay.,0
Great  a flat screen bigger tan my apartment -.- ,0
My old Apartment could fit more than twice in one of those flatscreens...,0
I have nothing else to write than this: countdown has begun! In six days we depart from Aarhus. Two cars. Five  maybe six guys. THE event og the year coming up. Grannylove! <3,0
The orange canvas is aprox 1900 m2 and covers about 1100-1200m2 ground as mentioned. its weight is 3 5 tonnes.,0
Isn't the screens upgraded to 65 sqm this year  someone told that on the message board.,0

Hej Roskilde Festival - I'm starting to look very much forward to this year's highlight - a week+ in your company!  I just looked through the Cinema programme  as I'm usually very much into the great movies you pick out every year - but the programme itself struck me a bit odd - Are you planning on running every movie just once  or will some be played more than once as last couple of years? I really hope the last  because once again you've got some great movies! ,0
Just once. The difference is that there is no Cinema tent this year but rather an open air cinema. This requires darkness so the films don't start until the sun sets.,0
Schultz And Forever is one of the rising stars playing Pavilion Junior.  Check out his new video and go to the new Roskilde Rising site for more exclusive material from our upcoming bands -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/roskilde_rising/,12
Love it <3 Lookin' forward!,0
I'm betting on this to be the best show at the orange stage. Ever!,0
Be aware of unofficial Roskilde competitions like the one B/dope Clothing has posted. It hasn't got anything to do with orange feeling and we haven't permitted it. Facebook competitions where you have to like and share to win aren't legal!,23
Have you already purchased your festival ticket and dream about arriving to a pitched tent or even sleep in your own caravan this summer? Not to worry. It’s possible – along with other options as well.,4
Hello  I have TWO tickets to sell. Had a rather unpleasant accident today and maybe one or two of you want to enjoy the concert instead. Please PM me asap if you're interested. I live in Odense,0
Do anybody want to change ticket? I have a south entrance  and need west!,0
Im interested in 2 full festival tickets. Send me a pm :),0
Hello people from Denmark  we need some information from you for our study project. We would be thankful if you support us with this short survey: http://www.studentenforschung.de/web/survey/505691 Thank you in advance!,0
We want Blur to play Roskilde Festival 2015 :),0
Lets hope for Blur @ Roskilde this summer :),0
Or at least a Blur but all four even better!,0
Option 1 doesn't exist in our universe. Cannot guarantee anything about option 2  but option 3 is a definite.,0
If you're serious about this you need to send an e-mail to info@roskilde-festival.dk where you explain this in greater detail,0
hi  will it be possible to see any of the Euro 2016 football matches at Roskilde  ?,0
No  rights issues prevent it AFAIK,0
Hi Gavin  As Anders wrote  rights issues prevents Roskilde Festival from showing material like the European Championships and the season finale of Game of Thrones :)  Mvh Rikke,0
Does anyone have tickets available for camping? Would need 2 tickets and prefer tenthouse or rockwool shelter.,0
The tenthouse and rockwool options are sold out. Normal camping access is already included with your ticket.,0
Hey! It's only 7 days left! If you don't know how to get to Roskilde  I have something to offer. We're leaving from Vilnius  Lithuania but feel free to join us from other places as well (for instance  Poland).  So if you have any questions  just let me know :),0
Testing the water in Swim City #rf13,5

Weather update:  The Weather forecast for tonight is very heavy rain. If you haven't already left  we recommend that you stay at home (and stay dry).

For those of you about to swim we salute you!,0
Oline Hyllested Madsen to ben i jorden,0

Kat Austin-MckennaFrankie eek! Feeling better about this one too!,0
I was there and i can not wait to hear this song again live this summer @ Roskilde :) ,0
Kate Tempest is touring the World  and we are really  really psyched about a certain show in the beginning of July.,1
The answer is no. We are working on different solutions for transport.,39
Music helps the homeless!  Roskilde Rising presents #rf15 act Wangel along with Förtress and Velvet Volume in a free triple concert at Koncertkirken in Copenhagen tomorrow at 8pm.  All profits from the bar will be donated to the homeless.   https://www.facebook.com/events/327162374139438/,13

When are you going to announce Chet Faker? He's all over in Europe in June and July. Please!!!,0
Blur are going to play festivals in july. I hope they will come to Roskilde also :),0
Do my eyes deceive me  or have you pushed Sigur Ros forward so that they start 1½ hour after Metallica  causing less of an overlap? THANK YOU!,0
It's true. Sigur Rós are playing at 00.00,0
I'll try again  Hi Roskilde Festival  Will there be luggage-storage and cell phone charging at Get-A-Tent downtown?  Ann: And a shop to buy breakfast and coffee?,0
Hi there. We're on it !  :) -Didn't forget about you,0
Casper so now we got an answer for you. Sorry about the wait. There will not be shops or luggage storage in the Get A Tent Downtown area because it is very close to all the shops in the skate area  so you should use these. There will be a shower area at Get A Tent Downtown though...,0
This is a mistake. I'll correct it.,0
Here is the winning Tuborg beer can design!  The design is made by Louise who is 25 and from Roskilde. She is a newly qualified media graphic designer  loves beer  and this summer her beer can design  which illustrates everything from condoms to tin cans  will decorate 3 million Tuborg beer cans!  Go to http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2015/here-is-the-winning-tuborg-beer-can-design to get more details on the design.,45
Start focusing on the so far poor Music programme and forget the can.,0
actually  it's not that poor,0
can I volunteer?,0
Yes you can. But can you kick it?,0
Hi Eduardo We will link to the volunteer application form on Facebook when it is ready. In the meantime you can follow @RFvolunteer on Twitter for updates.,0
I've seen some volunteer  jobs  on the page. I wish i had danish lessons but will it be chance for international workers? :),0
Are the tickets electronic or physical copies sent out by post? If they are sent by post  do they come as soon as you buy them or closer to the time of the festival? Thanks!,0
Hi Stuart The tickets are electronic.,0
Thank you! That's awesome,0
Acoording to your snap some news on saturday :) ?,0
Anyone have 2 tickets for the rockwool shelter or tenthouse for roskilde 2015?,0

Edit: All Get A Tents are now sold out.  Last chance to buy a pre-pitched tent at Roskilde Festival 2015.  Get A Tent East (medium) is sold out  and we have very few Get A Tent East (small) left.  Buy your tent here: roskil.de/rf15ticket,15
Where Can i see information about how much rain the small tent Can hold?,0
Will you be putting more tents in Get-A-Tent East for sale?,0
Hi Mads. The tent size is 2 10x2 10 meters and the tents look like the ones in the picture.,0
Hi Cecilie. It probably won't rain at #RF15  -). But we will be happy to look into it if you need technical details.,0
I sure dont hope so  ) it'll just be Nice to know if i need to have a  plan b  in case of a new '07 experience,0
Cecilie  unless you need very specific technical details you shouldn't wait to long before buying the tent.,0
Let's cross our fingers and hope the 2007 weather will never return,0
Jaaaa O.o,0
Hi Ida. It probably depends on how good a friend you're bringing into the tent. It's 2 10 x 2 10 meters,0
Bring a tarp.,0
That's not legal :) due to safety Roskilde need to be able to see all tents,0
Hi Stephanie. At this moment the answer is no. But we will do a waiting list that you can put your name on. Then you'll be first in line if more become available  or somebody decides not to use their tent and want to sell it.,0
Here's the link: https://www.billetnet-media.dk/tools/ventelister/show.php?event=UPSRF03-2015&l=en,0
Thank you Roskilde Festival I have already signed up for the waiting list. I am crossing everything that I can and hope that you decide to expand the get-a-tent area and put more tents for sale :-),0
Tickets for Saturday have sold out. Didn't get one?  Now is your chance. We have two one day tickets for Saturday left to give away.

Arne Juel Larsen   my Daddy ??,0
I would absolutely love to bring my dad Steen Christiansen. He is 74 years old  and has never been a visitor at the festival. (I can't tag him here  because he doesn't have a facebookprofile) But the real reason why I want to bring him to the festival  is because he is the best  the most coolest  and the most devoded festival dad you can imagine :-)  It all began three years ago  when I went to my first festival ever  at the age of 32. I was a bit nervous about going  but he told me  to go  relax  and have all the fun in the world  but also to check in with my parents from time to time - just so they knew that I was still alive.? And I did. On sunday - before the music began  I was at my civilian work  and he called me  to hear how I was doing. I told him how fun it was  and about the people I had met  but then I complained to him about how heavy all my gear was. My dad just listened to my complaining and when I was finished  he just asked me this   well sweetheart  how about I come and pick you up  when the festival is over. I could have kissed him.? in stead he got a really smelly hug the following monday morning  after the festival was over:-) poor dad :-) Here is why he is the coolest and devoted festival dad I know  and why he deserves one of the tickets for saturday. Ever since that monday morning in the beginning of july 3 years ago  every year  when I am getting ready to go to the festival site  he asks me if I have everything I need for 10 days in a tent on a plowfield. when I say  yep  he says  cool. I will pick you up after the festival  see you then. And so he has ever since. And so he will. He still calls me a few times during the week i'm away  to hear how I'm doing  and He loves to pick me up after the festival  and listen to my stories. He calls it  to experience the festival  second hand . And i would absolutely love if he would be able to get a real sense of the  true  Orange feeling  first hand  finishing his day at #RF15 together with me  and Sir Paul  while having the time of his life :-),0
My father Börje Iborn. Simply because he's sure that Roskilde Festival is for crack addicts.,0
I would bring Maliina Boassen. She's a hard working mother and we deserve a little girls night with the lovely Paul!,0

My husband Adnan A. Akçay,0
My wife Emma. My first festival was 1999 and I have been there every year since. My wife went for the first time in 2005 and since 2006 we have been going together every year. This year we can't go for an entire festival because we have a little daughter to take care of. But a one day ticket for saturday would be awesome so that we can go see the old guy that is playing  get some drinks at GringoBar and eat at Spagetti 45! :P,0
I would like to go with Sebastian Castellanos We will enjoy ... Is our chance to see him ??????????????????,0
I would bring my boyfriend  because I think he hasn't yet completely realized what makes Roskilde so special. So maybe the second time would do the trick!,0
Mum & dad would get both tickets from me! <3 They are both big fans of McCartney  but just told me they didn't manage to get day tickets in time. My mum has been sick since Jan 14  so they couldn't go see the Stones last year and this would be the ultimate summer holiday experience for my parents  with my mum getting better day by day!,0
I would bring my wife to see McCartney. As a big fan of him and Beatles it would be the perfect set-up for a first-timer on Roskilde (which she would be) and it would be a perfect 50-year old birthday present. I'll keep my fingers crossed :-),0
i would bring my girl friend for her very first visit to roskilde festival and danmark :),0
Paul mccartney is my favorite human being on the planet. And I am not just saying that for this post. I've read all his autho biographies  I've studied every song he has ever written  I've taken a 4 unit class on the Beatles and I know everything from how he met john Lennon to what cigaret he was smoking when he wrote Helter Skelter! I've been wanting to go to Roskilde since I found out about it 4 years ago from my Danish friends who were exchange students at my school! This year we've finally decided to go and I would hate to fly out from the USA and MISS seeing paul mccartney ?? I would take my friend Kristina Natalia because she's been introducing me to everything that is Danish over the years and she's the one who introduced this festival to me... And I'm sure she's the one I'm going to be crashing her apartment for the festival! PICK ME PICK ME ?? I would sing my lungs out from the very first song to the end without missing a beat,0
I would bring my dad Jørgen Uldall-Ekman (no facebook)  because if it wasn't for him  I wouldn't be such a big fan of The Beatles. I'm dying to see Paul McCartney and was so unfortunate that I didn't get a ticket..,0
Coming all the way to Roskilde from California with Amy Katzman to get that #orangefeeling !!! Pick us .,0
My dear friends Mette Løwenstein and Morten Kofoed Løwenstein are the receivers of the 2 tickets. They would love to be in Roskilde listening to Sir Paul McCartney.   Hoping for the best. ????????,0

Marie Fasmer my true love,0
An summer adventure with Anna !,0
My wonderful daughter,0
I would love to bring my dad  Arne Lauritsen (who doesn't have Facebook)  as he is a huge beatles fan  especially of Paul McCartney. He had several opportunities to see him live  but life always seemed to get in the way. This probably is the only chance he will ever have to see Paul. He is in the beatles club and is one of their top members  but has never seen any of them live. He would be overjoyed to see Paul and to come back to Roskilde after 42 years. I hope he will win a ticket! He would cry throughout the concert??????,0
Solveig Korsgaard Roseth my daughter!,0
Would love to bring my grandmother Wenche Thorstensen,0

I would like to bring my kid Minni Klein with- first time for her in life and for me after 25 years again for the 5time in life ??,0
My dear friend Miia Ojala because she's never been to Roskilde and I know she would love it! We have both experienced huge difficulties last year in our personal lives and we have decided this year is ours! ????,0
My mom Liselotte Olsen - She is a die-hard The Beatles and Paul McCartney fan and have been so for years! And I'd just like to show her a bit of Roskilde Festival and show her just how amazing it is to me as she has never been to a festival before - and certainly not THE Festival  as I have called it for 4 years now and counting.,0
I want to bring my father because he is a surviver - he has survived both cancer and a heartattack  with a positive spirit  and with an intention to live life to the fullest. He has always supported me going to the festival and last year he finally came for Stevie Wonder but McCartney is someone from his youth and I know it would be the time of his life. I dont need a ticket since I work as a volunteer and have done so for the last 3years.,0
Oliver Dust :D,0
My husband Nicki Jepsen,0
I World love to give it to my husband Lasse Nybro and hos father. It would be the experience of their life. And they so deserve it.,0

I would love to have my best friend  collegue and 'brother' with me in Roskilde. He will be 64 in July  and when I was 64 some months ago he and his band had recorded their version of 'When Im 64' to me so there is a lot of Beatles in our lives,0
I would bring my friend Johann! :),0
20 years ago my lder brother Chris Soleng was considerate enough to bring the seventeen year old me to my first Roskilde festival  am almost life changing experience for me  that I am forever greatfull for. I don't think we actually went to any concerts together  our taste back then differed to much  amd after that I started my own Roskilde traditions. Come to think of it  I dont think he's been there since. Anyway  he loves Roskilde festival  I love Roskilde festival  and maybe it is just about time for a reunion. He ain't heavy  he's my brother  and we've spent hours and hours of our early childhood in the bsck of our parents car listening to Paul McCartney's Tug of war  on pur way to summer holidays in northern swedish camp sites - McCartney is our musical meeting point. A sign  if there ever was one  that my big brother and I - The Solengs - need to get two tickets to the danish countryside this summer. We miss the place!,0
Would love to win and take my dad Tommy J P Madsen so he could experience his first Roskilde festival with me and our favorite musician!,0
Katrine Hansen because she has never ben to Roskilde Festival. I believe this ticket would change that for ever and she would be a returning gest after trying it!!!!,0

Because they know they can sell all the Saturday tickets with just that name. He's that legendary.,0
Some  educated guesses about the schedule can be found at the Roskilde  Festival Forum here: http://roskilde-festival.community/topic5356.html,0

Appetite for...?  Our food app is ready to guide you through a world of flavours. Download APPetizer (for iPhone) here --> http://bit.ly/APPetizer  Made with love for Roskilde Festival by Hello Group and Appbuilders,28
Any chance us windows phone users are getting some sort of app from you guys?,0
APPetizer for Android will be available soon.,0
What about windows phone?,0
What is THE most metal meal you can offer?,0
Yo RF  any chance there'll be an app up n' running during the festival  equivalent to the one you guys had last year - found it rather helpful being equipped with maps  schedule etc. on my phone throughout the whole week! See you next saturday - it's been a while <3,0
...Destruction! By Guns n Roses,0
excellent app :D,0
destruction!  Appetite for destruction! love that record (GnR),0
Gonna Dixie it so hard up in this,0

Cool! RF  is there by any chance a setting of the app that helps you find the cheapest meals? I'm poor  but can't live on mackarel alone.,0
9 to go :-D,0
I thought you added feed me to the line-up for a second. Damn you Roskilde festival..,0
When is the official Roskilde 2013 app coming?,0
WE DONT CARE ABOUT THE FOOD GIVE US MORE BEER VOUCHERS,0
Hi there.  You can buy your parking tickets here http://www.billetlugen.dk/products/search/15/?pcatid=12&catid=125 or on site when the festival opens.  And you are able to park south of P. For more info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4236,0
Cinema City has chosen to prioritize in a different way this year and will have a greater focus on audience participation and involvement. Therefore there might be slightly fewer movies on the programme this year. Try to have a look in our app (iphone – android should be ready tomorrow) where you will be able to see what other interesting stuff Cinema City has lined up for you guys this year.,0
Another explanation is that the films play in an open air cinema. It needs to be dark for it to work.,0
Done ... I am Dreaming big :),0
Delt! :D ,0
Do not sleep on this!!!!!!!,0
Keep an eye on this thread: http://roskilde-festival.community/topic5356.html at the Roskilde Festival Forum.,0
Ghost to Roskilde Festival 2015! Make it happen  please!,0
how many tickets left? Do i still have a chance?  ),0
Hi Jessie. You can still buy your ticket  but hurry up ! :),0
So do we take that as you are confirming that you are close to sold out?,0
Hi Roskilde-people. I was wondering  could you possibly start having some gluten free stuff at your festival? Like  bread for hamburgers  or anything? I love your festival heaps  and the only frustrating thing about it are those days when I either have to eat just a slice of meat  dig out some food from a breadroll  or just go with a side order cause there's nothing I can eat. Pretty  pretty please? I promiseI'll buy it  so it won't be a waste of money! :),0
Hi Desirée   All food stands at Roskilde are required to have a list of their ingredients so ask in the stands if you have gluten allergies.,0
Hi! Yes  I know. And that's super! Thanks for that. I was just thinking you'd might be able to get some bread at the festival  or in the campsite? The bread I sneak in from Roskilde city tends to get quite disgusting after some days in the tent  hehe. :) But thanks for making it easier already! : D,0
What's your favourite festival food?,47
Mayonnaise  only mayonnaise.,0
lol  nobody else than me eats bacon? weak.,0
Bacon to everything else ratio in this picture is way to low!,0
Find it with our new official Roskilde Festival food app: https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/appetizer-roskilde-festival/id535581564?mt=8 #hellogroup #cooljob #roskilde #roskildefestival,0
How many eggs?,0
Hvidløgsbrød! >:D,0
Big mama's veggie pandekager!!!,0
how abut the beer ?,0
Mikkel BeerGeek Samberg Actually we don't have that number. Take a wild guess - we will try to find out in the meantime...,0
But roskilde how much does shower cost?,0
Brynjar Go here for shower-facts: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4216... Good egg-guess by the way... We will find the correct answer soon. More guesses anyone?,0
A shower is usually 30-40 kr  if you need hot water. Cold showers are usually free :),0
Alexander Aleg-One Kolby That is kind of weak. How does everybody else get the energy to headbang their way through 8 days of music????,0
Mikkel BeerGeek Samberg Drumrole... And the amount of eggs consumed at RF12 is 3 tons! How many eggs is that  really?,0
Exactly! The food pyramid of a true metalhead is basically just bacon soaked in beer!,0
About 50.000 eggs  assuming one egg weights 60 grams.,0
Morten Hvass Jensen That might be a mistake - or maybe 2011 was a really poor year for coffee-loving festival-goers  -),0
At least there's more cheese than salad!,0
Never too much eggs tho:),0
Is the app at all available for windows phones?,0
I just found on your site that an app for windows will be available from the beginning of June... I think we're well into June now but I can't see any links or info for it..,0
It's a mistake. The correct amount is 4 tons of organic Fair Trade coffee. And that's just the dryweight. Imagine how many cups that is  -),0
what about android!??,0
I'm certain that *I* drank more than 4 liters of coffee in 2011...,0
Don't worry. It's there - and we'll never run out of it.,0
see you guys on exotic food  Camp M  ),0
If you... a) Need a ride to Roskilde Festival or have free space in your car b) Are not afraid to make new friends or talk to strangers  ...then Roskilde Rideshare with Ants might just be the thing. Lots of trips to the festival just now.  Check out the link for trips + extra goodiness -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/special-parking-for-roskilde-rideshare-cars/,33
or use gomore.dk,0
How about a ride back  from roskilde to holland??:D hihi,0
So some of the parking tickets are still available? how do we know when there arent anymore left?,0
doesn't seem to work,0
Jj Holst: Yep. But with Ants you get reserved parking and a chance to win Roskilde Festival 2014 tickets for everyone in the car  -),0
sounds jolly :D,0
Tobias Morgen Rye Hansen: Yes  there are still  Park'n'Pay  tickets being sold for DKK 365 - (http://www.billetlugen.dk/products/search/15/?pcatid=12&catid=125). Apart from that there is a free parking some distance from the festival grounds (http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2013/map/Roskilde_map_2013_Final_11.06.13.pdf). The latter doesn't need reservation  but are just filled up until there's room for no more cars. The Ants reserved parkings spots are situated in a closed area in the free parking spots - in the areas closest to the festival grounds,0
Martin Pagh Ludvigsen: Well  let's not hope that's the kind of hitchers you'll attract :-) Good eighties movie btw,0

Hi Paul  if you post a ride to Roskilde from iPhone  Android  Windows Phone or web we'll contact you when you are more than 3 in the car. /Ants,0
I signed up at ants  but isn't working..? :l but I'm interested in the ride hahh,0
Are there still free parking tickets available? I filled up my car this morning,0
It should work :-/ Get the app for iPhone  Android og Windows Phone. Search for rides to Leeuwarden. If you're on web: sign up and search for Leeuwarden. Then you'll find it :-) /Ants,0
That movie singlehandedly destroyed a long  proud tradition of hitchhiking in most western countries  including Denmark. It's very important that we don't forget that!,0
Kat Pertola: Yep. Ants should send you a mail,0
Nope  only 95. But still good news.,0
Haha  you're right. Silly me  just consulted the countdown at the website,0

In 7 hours there is less than 100 days until Roskilde Festival 2012.  Who's excited?,33
It's the stars of Roskilde Food!  It might not have Metallica and Kraftwerk - but it does have Mackerel and Roast Pork. The Food Poster is out!,54
not to be a hater - but shouldn't you proof read your posters maybe?? By ecology - don't you mean organic food?? Ecology is maybe (??) not the correct word choice?,0
I really hope you do not allow any tiger prawns to be served this year! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw0tkYK7oEM,0
what about gluten free food? :),0
We stand corrected.,0
It's all love! I just want you to be perceived as pro' as possible!! <3 :*,0
Give me a couple of free tickets each year and I'll proof read the hell out of your materials #dayjob,0
I pointed this out after last years festival  here on FB  and you answered you would look into it. Did you?,0
Emilie Nadja Skygebjerg yes. It's almost done and looking really nice. Stay tuned. We will post a link when it is done...,0
Daniel KM Lindström We encourage all our food-vendors to act ethic when buying products for their stalls. We focus on working with sustainable products that are used a lot on the festival to achieve as large an environmental impact as possible.,0
OK  last year your encouragement did not suffice as there were several places serving tiger prawns  both the sushi place and also Rocknrisotto. Let's hope for a better result this year as they are both present this year according to the poster. And if not  a more stern statement for next year.,0
Would love some sort of list covering where/what is gluten free. :D,0
Gluten: All stands are required to have a list of their ingredients so ask in the stands if you have gluten allergies. ^Taken from their own homepage,0
you can actually say both. Organic only means that it is all biological based  unprocessed/unmodified  while ecology is about growing the foods with care and respect for the ecological system  which they are a part of. I would say ecology is actually more correct  while yes  organic is widely used in the UK/US. It's also just what is easiest to say  since no one would want to say - e.g. all organic and ecological friendly coffee.  Organic food  probably just sounds better  ),0
Will it be possible to buy 24x33cl beer near the G-tower or the Apollo-area? Or do you have to go across the bridge to the west center? :-),0
Hi there. You can buy beer at CITY centres East and West and at the Get A Tent site. More info can be found here http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4220,0
I think Simon likes my answer more.  ),0
It was also more accurate than RF's answer,0
Roskilde Festival  can we use the beer voucher at the trailers as well? :-),0
Really? Is this how you treat your festival goers? No security? I'm never. Ever. Going. Will be publicizing widely.  cc Sade Pilot & Kendalle Fiasco,0
did you fall?,0
We're very sorry to hear about Kendalle's experience  and we've let her know as a reply to her blog post.,0
It's a terrible story  and I have heard stories about the security being slack before (There's a thread about it on the official forum  if my memory serves me). But coming to the conclusion that Roskilde Festival is a xenophobic and bigoted place is downright absurd.,0
Roskilde Festival is the place in the world I feel most safe.  It is very sad what happen to you  but more security is not what Roskilde need  more security would kill the freedom of Roskilde  and you were just very unlucky  it is sad  but that was what you was.  And it is a lie when you say that the was no one to report it to  yes the might not have some guards to stop it  be this is a lot of Police and officel Roskilde people to report it to. And what happen to you is a job for the Police.   Bad things happen all over the world  the only way to make it better is for all of us to keep on being good ppl  not by making the world full of guard and surveillance.,0
I have replied to this blog.. Roskilde does have a lot of people at it and there is bound to be some assholes... I am from Ireland and have been there seven times and can say 100% that it's not full of racism or bigotry... I have walked around ALL the camp site and NEVER saw Swastikas or anything like it... You got slapped in the ass  I know it's wrong but you should have ignored it... Simple as that...,0
Being a free country with free rights for people ultimately means equal rights for douchebags  who pick fights with people. Roskilde Festival is not responsible for other people's actions.  I am truly sorry for what happened to you and Brett  but that is not solely the responsibility of Roskilde Festival. This could have occured anywhere with a lot of people and alcohol/drugs involved. This happening to you  Kendalle  is a tragedy  but could've happened even if the security was better.  You'll see murders in top security prisons with staff educated in making sure it doesn't happen. You can never have a zero percent crime rate  especially in a place with 130k people on the loose.  Once again I am truly sorry about what happened to you  but your anger is directed in the wrong direction and as other people say  it is a police matter and should be treated as such.,0
A bit of a short answer the first time around. What I mean is you can't base accusations like this on one piece of anecdotal evidence. It's akin to saying all muslims are terrorists because one dickhead blew himself up in the name of Allah. At Roskilde Festival there are 130k people  and drunk at that. I bet you can go down to your local pub and pick a fight more effortlessly than at Roskilde Festival. And you've only got a handful of people there. You need to actually ask a big group of foreigners attending the festival to hear their views on it. And then maybe you'd be able to say if Roskilde Festival is indeed a xenophobic or bigoted place. I really doubt it's the case.,0
I've come to Roskilde every year since 2004. And I have not seen one single fight.,0
I have replied to this blog.. Roskilde does have a lot of people at it and there is bound to be some assholes... I am from Ireland and have been there seven times and can say 100% that it's not full of racism or bigotry... I have walked around ALL the camp site and NEVER saw Swastikas or anything like it...

A community is absolutely needed. But  for example  at festivals like Burning Man there are rangers available when needed. There's also a community that cares about the people who attend its' gatherings. This kind of security breach is absolutely horrible. Not even the COMMUNITY was available to defend against this mob? cc: Kendalle Fiasco,0
No  she and her boyfriend were beaten up by a group. She was thrown to the ground.,0
WHAT!? Are you serious? Just ignore harassment? And not stand up for yourself? This isn't about racism or xenophobia. It's about stupid young people with no one who regards others in this festival. NO ONE was there to help. Not even police. Is that really what you advocate? Consider other festivals like Burning Man who have 1000s of people and 100s of rangers & police  too. This shouldn't have happened.,0
Erica you have never been her. You have seen one bad story. What you are doing is wrong. You dont know what you are talking about  Roskilde do not need more police or guards.,0
@martin - it's all well and good for you to say  the only way to make it better is for all of us to keep on being good ppl  but alas that is not reality and not everyone is benevolent. so since we don't live in a dream world and there are unfortunately assholes living amongst us  there must be forms of protection for the good ppl to not only report crimes  but also be protected from them occurring in the first place.,0
First of I am pretty sure I can´t beat up anyone. In your blog you say that 1 volunteer said she could throw them out  and no she can´t. But that don’t make it true when you clame the is no one to report it to. You DID´T go to the police. I am right? Good then you are lying. Roskilde has the lowest rate be cores it is the most safe place  not be cores you can’t report it. It is easy to report  And stop only look for think to misinterpret. You just want to pick a fight online and hate? That don’t make the world better,0
Hi Martin. Please come back to reality and recognize that a fight (and even worse a fight that starts with sexist attacks or abuse) is horrible and Roskilde both the community and officiel festival should seek to prevent.  The solusions is up for debat  not that something went wrong.,0
Thank you  Anders!,0
I am terribly sorry for what has happened to Kendalle. I am not sure that a massive police presence or on-site bouncers (not the volunteer safety personnel we know from Roskilde) would have prevented any of that though.   And while this is clearly an example of horrible sexism I don't think it's fair to pull the race card at all and try to paint Scandinavians as a whole as bigoted or racist – the arguments that support it are very vague and it kinda weakens Kendalle's other points. Racists at Roskilde would seem very out of place since the performing artists at the festival are all over the map culturally. I don't think they'd feel at home at a festival that takes world music so seriously as Roskilde does. I've attended the festival 15 years amongst other with an Iranian several years and have never witnessed any racial bigotry at all.  Violence and sexism ALSO occurs at Burning Man. Here's a pretty good read about it: http://eplaya.burningman.com/viewtopic.php?t=31982   Statistically every time you gather up thousands of people  you're bound to also attract some nasty elements. It sounds cynical  but it's reality. In Burning Man's case people even carry loaded guns there. People also die at BM  from drugs  accidents and even murder. If you feel safer at that BM  that's perception playing your rational mind a trick. It is not safer than Roskilde or many other festivals.,0
Kendalle -> you don´t read most of what I am writing  so I will drop the debat. I am sry that the police man on the ground did´t have time  but there is a police station.  And again I will say what I start to say  what happend to you was wrong and sad.,0
I've been going five times now (going again this year) and I've never seen a single fight at the festival. Or swastikas or  Heil Hitler -tags for that matter (not that I pay attention to that kind of crap)  I don't know why you brought that up anyway.,0
Being a WOMAN  and a short  fairly helpless one at that  I feel 100% safe at Roskilde. This will be my third year at Roskilde  and I have never had a negative experience of such a kind. Sure  there are some sexual comments etc every now and again  but I usually brush it off to people being drunk. One time did I comment back that something was rude and obnoxious  and I got a very sincere apology back. So no  I do not believe Roskilde is a dangerous or terrible place for women. It's terrible that this happened to you  and I think people have a hard time believe it  because most have never seen anything similar to this happen at Roskilde! And I must agree - There should be more voulenteers/guards who have some idea about first aid and helping out in situations as this. But attacing all the men commenting  based on the fact that they are men  is equally as sexist as what you say happened.,0
Let's remember this isn't about racism. It's about assault. Doesn't matter what language you speak--beating someone up is BAD. And the fact there was NO security and police couldn't assist. UGH  CHANGE is necessary!,0
Sure there's violence on the Playa. But there are people to turn to for help. There are many rangers and police that will help when needed.,0
No one is disagreeing with regards to violence being bad. And no one is condoning it. The fact remains that Kendalle said that Roskilde Festival is a xenophobic place and that the volunteers need anti-racism (and anti-sexism) seminars. None of us brought up ethnicity.,0
Well maybe that's a solution. Or maybe something else is a solution. But a problem was had here and the root of it is assault.,0
I agree that the problem is the assault and the way it was taken care of by the volunteers and police officers. I can't see how said seminars would help prevent that in the future.,0
Agreed. How else could this problem be solved then?,0
The police officers could start doing their jobs. Honestly  it's hard to answer as the problem is very complex. I'm sure it's something considered every year by the festival. How many police officers do we need? etc.,0
That just simply won't fly. Are you going to wait until a law suit strikes you? Why not have a better system of community policing? Offer SOME kind of solution! I'm sure you've heard other complaints of assault happening.,0
Free societies have the responsibility to care for folks who've been assaulted. There was no reason for this.,0
Hold on now  Kendalle.  Everyone needs a seminar on racism . All this racism you're talking about. I can't for the life of me see where it enters the equation. And the sexism. I know drunks can be rude and you're very well within your rights to tell them off (or throw a beer in their faces for that matter) without them resorting to violence  which they sadly did. Again you can't equate one instance of sexism (I know there'll be more than one if you ask around the campsite) to Roskilde Festival having a big sexism related problem. Lastly  how are two instances at Burning Man less significant than one instance  your own  at Roskilde Festival?,0
Kendalle Fiasco  feel free to express your opinions  but please watch your language.,0
Kendalle: I just cannot fathom why you keep on bringing the racial issue up since it has nothing to do with the assault you suffered. I am just saying that it muddles up your essay  because it seems that the root of the assault stems from sexism and not racism  which is an extremely minor problem at a place like Roskilde Festival as opposed to sexism.  Good point about the police  but that's a general problem about Denmark and not Roskilde Festival per se  lazy cops  who don't do their work  like Thomas Maagaard says.   I did in fact read the post thoroughly. I could maybe have dug up better examples. This one is indeed a scary read: http://burners.me/2012/09/19/the-dark-side-of-burning-man-rape-on-the-playa-sf-weekly/,0
You're both missing Jeppe's point in the last paragraph.,0
And festivals are filled with festival goers  some whom are giant turds and like to play bongos on female behinds. Looking at your incident isolated  I can only disapprove and disrespect their cowardly actions  but again  you can't hold Roskilde Festival responsible for this.  It is a police matter and should be treated as such. You can contact them here: https://www.facebook.com/politi  Erica  you are right in there being no reason  that's unfortunately the human condition. That doesn't make it ok  but it's a fact that people in large groups act like animals  especially when you add alcohol or drugs.   I understand and hope that your crusade to improve security pays off  but Roskilde Festival is still one of the safest festivals in the world  but unfortunatey we still see rape  deaths and accidents every year  regardless of the safety meassures taken.,0
you can't really sue the festival because the police failed to their job.. sorry that this happened to your friends  and yes someone should have stepped in to help them  and the volunteers should also have done a better job  but assault is a police matter  and regarding the rangers.. then that is really not the danish armed forces' area  therefore police is mostly to blame and your anger is directed towards the wrong people?,0

Cool  didn't know,0
Normally I dont like hiphop  but it was quite good IMO.,0
One of the things I really love about Roskilde  is the way the names are released. I know a lot of people have been (and continuously will) complaining about the names  saying that they're not 'big enough'. Now  I think the way the names are getting released give people some time to listen to the individual bands  and getting to know some new names. If Roskilde just released a full band list  where Tool and RATM and so on would be on top of the bill  close to no one would take the time to listen to the smaller bands. I just wanna say thank you Roskilde for giving me a great opportunity to find new amazing bands  that I would never have heard of it wasn't for you :) I already got 20 names on my list of bands that I wanna see  so for me this is going to be a great festival already.  And don't worry  the bigger names are going to come later!,0
Thank you for the kind words  Mathiaes. We still hot some ground to cover and I bet most people will be satisfied in the end.,0

They're meant for a phone  so our guess is that they will run dry pretty quickly if you use them for a stereo. But ask here: http://getvolt.dk/ - they ought to know,0
For a normal stereo at reasonable listening levels. About 30-40 minutes is a good estimate.,0
hey! my friend Maiken Austinat ordered her ticket for 1 and a half month ago  but she havent got it yet. We are leaving for Denmark in 11 days so she kinda need it before we go. she live in Kleistsgate 4.,0
Very cool. Feel free to post it to their Facebook page Dream City - Roskilde Festival,0
Is it correct that you will be announcing the full lineup before the end of March? As stated at the end of this article: http://ekstrabladet.dk/musik/intlmusiknyt/mccartneys-roskilde-show-bliver-laaaaaaangt/5470636,0
Yup. That is correct.,0
But is it the full as in all bands  or like the poster we normaly get in April and then get around 20 names after that?,0
Martin  we still can't say how many bands we are going to announce after the line-up release. We will have an answer for you after the line-up release.,0
 RATM and Tenacious D! ),0
http://youtu.be/AibePtkjAd4,0
Do you reply by e-mail when you have received ones tribute to the 'sticker' competition?,0
Undortunately no  but rest assure that it's received,0
Sorry to say  but I really think the program is getting worse year after year ..   this fact doesn't match the prices whose only become higher .. the artist are more and more unknown ..  ,0
Who are  well known  in your eyes then?,0
Foo Fighters  Radiohead  Disturbed  Rammstein  Pearl Jam  Coldplay  Lenny Kravitz  Metallica  Volbeat  System of a down  The whigs   Lifehouse  Anouk  The Cranberries  Chris Cornell/Audioslave  Roxette  KOL  Guns n' Roses  AC/DC  Creed  U2  Guano Apes  Red Hot Chilli Peppers  Snow Patrol and Lars Lilholt of course..,0
and for those names you got a spot for 8 of them :) This year we got like three of those for now with Springsteen  Cure  and Bjørk.. :),0
At least one of those bands don't exist anymore and at least half of them aren't really touring Europe this summer. It's easy to dream  harder to be a realist.,0
Well  still loads of bookings left. Let's see what they'll release. Would be pretty sweet if RHCP or GNR got booked.,0
RHCP and GNR!? WTF?? They have played the two worst concerts in the history of Roskilde!,0
I don't thin you'll see either one of those two anytime soon at Roskilde. Both underperformed vastly  when they appeared at the festival five and six years ago  respectively.,0
Springsteen and the Cure are obviously no match for Lars Lilholt......,0
Pavla Schlägerova  we can only repeat ourselves: no one's forcing you to come if you don't like the lineup.,0
Thanks for not booking Lars Lilholt!!!!!!! Pavla: he's playing at Jelling  and I think there's still tickets!,0
Doesn't bother me much if GNR or RHCP doesn't get booked  but from Pavlas list those are the 2 bands that I found most interesting. FF and Rammstein would be pretty awesome  but not sure if they are gonna tour this summer.,0
What a discussion .. :) .. I know it depends on which kind of music people likes.. I just think there is an opportunity to make a better line up ..  Coldplay is going to play in Denmark in summer  Lenny Kravitz is going to play in Middelfart  Snow Patrol at NorthSide  Pearl Jam right after Roskilde (of course I totally understand if they don't want to come after what happened) and the same with Chris Cornell who's actually going to play during the Roskilde Festival ..,0
Just a to name a few ...,0
and Lars Lilholt --> that was of course just for fun  ),0
Pavla: Just took a little look around on the internet to check. Realistically speaking  only three of the names you mention are actually an option.  Foo Fighters – not touring EU this summer Rammstein – not touring EU this summer Volbeat – not touring EU this summer SOAD – not touring EU this summer Lifehouse – not touring EU this summer The Whigs – not touring EU this summer (and  let's get Afghan Whigs instead.) Metallica – not touring EU during Roskilde Guano Apes – not touring during Roskilde Coldplay – touring USA during Roskilde  Radiohead – touring  but already booked up Lenny Kravitz – touring  but booked for Rock Under Broen in Middelfart instead. I can understand why – it's been a while since he made an album worth listening to. Snow Patrol – toruing  but booked for the Northside Festival instead.  Disturbed – not touring at all U2 – not touring at all Kings of Leon – not touring at all (and played Roskilde last year!) Audioslave – doesn't exist anymore  Chris Cornell – only plays solo shows this summer as an 'extension' of Soundgarden's tour. Playing elsewhere in Denmark  so he won't be booked. Pearl Jam – touring  but come on  be realistic. they DON'T want to return to Roskilde. They play elsewhere in Denmark instead.  Cranberries – touring – might be possible. They'd have to do four concert days in a row to pull it off  so it might be a longshot. Anouk – touring – entirely possible. I haven't heard a single thing from her in years though. Is she still  big  outside Belgium and the Netherlands? Roxette – touring – entirely possible  Guns 'n' Roses – won't be booked again  is my best bet – disappointed greatly last time at Roskilde Red Hot Chili Peppers – won't be booked again  is my best bet – disappointed greatly last time at Roskilde,0
You seriously need to get better/bigger artists  Peace & Love is kicking your ass in artists right now,0
They're having a big artist/band release on the 19th of April  like they always do.,0
I'll take Roskilde's headliners over any of the P&L ones. They have a couple of strong subliners though. Other than that  well  I think I'm not swedish enough to really dig their lineup.,0
After the poster release Roskilde will have a superior lineup to Peace & Loves  pretty sure of that :),0
I hope you are right,0
Well  it's not too hard to top P&L lineup  Rise Against  Hatebreed  DK Murphys and Dahlbäck are the  best  bookings imo. Men alla är vi olika haha! :),0
Rise Against is awesome and Dropkick Murphys to :),0
I dont see anything on P&L that matches Springsteen.,0

Calm down  angry person.,0
We Would like to but tinkens for the Day of Paul McCartney - but my husband has severe handicaps and ned a safe place. Is that possible?,0
Hey Roskilde Festival can't you get Katzenjammer to come and play this year? They released a new album not so long ago and they are fucking awesome live! You can ask anyone who has ever been to a concert with them!,0
René  sorry about that - but the areas wren't ready as we had hoped. They new location is really not bad at all. Have a great festival!,0
Treat your camp to a cold one!  Pre-order 24 Tuborg  6 Tuborg Summer and 6 Tuborg Ultra. Only DKK 149 (incl. refund).   Order our Tuborg-package here: http://bit.ly/TuborgPackage,364
Can you pick up these once it starts on saturday?,0
As a norwegian  and a 4th timer - the prices still give me goosebumps!,0
how much does it cost without preorder?,0
For how long do you offer this ?,0
ITS SO FUCKING CHEEAAAP!,0
If you buy 5 packages  can you pick them up regularly like 1 pack monday  then tuesday etc.?,0
Can you pick them up on other days as well? For instance on monday tuesday  wednesday  etc?,0
Only at the Service Centres? Not at the beer sale at agoras? Or are they not there anymore?,0
YES! THE BEEEEER!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I just bought 5. The Price is 149 x 5  so the price is the same if you buy more. And you get a voucher per  box  of beer you buy  so you can pick 1 up at the time :)   (1 = 36 beers),0
Some definitive answers would be nice.,0
Do you have to pre-order  or can you just buy it for the same price on-site?,0
What if you got excess vouchers after the 5th Roskilde Festival?,0
Do you skip the normal line or what? Cannot see everyone else having asked this (sry if I'm wrong)..,0
What is Tuborg Summer? Isn't that like light beer 2.3% or something? Is there any way to exchange those with Ultras or normal tuborgs? (Ain't anyone gonna want to drink light beer :D),0

Is dream if we could have The Who back  last time in 2007. Blur  last time in 2003 and Alice Cooper. Cooper have never play Roskilde before. Could be awesome to have these 3 to Roskilde this summer. But thanks again for Sir Paul McCartney :),0
Thank you again for Sir Paul McCartney. This weekend is going to be awesome. I hope we will also get Blur to Roskilde Festival and if Alice Cooper can also come  then it will be awesome also :) By the way Blur are getting ready for some shows :) https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153642883480744&set=vb.7151355743&type=2&theater,0
Hey Roskilde Festival!  Is there absolutely no chance of getting in to 'get a place N' any longer? We were 2 hours away from purchasing (gathering money to buy as 1) A waiting list?,0
næh :D,0
What happened to the discussions on the former web layout - is it gone  moved or...??,0
You can find the forum right here: http://roskilde-festival.community,0
So... McCartney? Confirmed?,0
Talking about timing. Woah!,0
The legendary Paul McCartney is playing Roskilde Festival 2015.  We feel extremely honoured to welcome Paul McCartney to the iconic Orange Stage on Saturday 4 July. Tickets: roskil.de/rf15ticket,1152
Sir Paul McCartney to play in France in June. Please book him to Roskilde Festival :) ? https://www.facebook.com/266327946760944/photos/a.274109732649432.64549.266327946760944/842689215791478/?type=1&theater,0
Hi there. Nop  there are still south entrance tickets for you. Have a look at http://roskilde-festival.dk/ticket/question_and_answers/entrance_booking/ to see how you switch your entrance booking.,0
We LOVE it.  If you have a hi-res version  please do send it to us (ahr@roskilde-festival.dk). With your permission we'd like to re-post it.,0
This photo wins the internet,0
It has been sent to you :) And we're of course staying in Nibbleton  home of the Hobbits of Roskilde.,0

Hahahaha :D,0
Dixie  I'm coming home! <3,0
Does this exist in a veggie version as well  :-),0
Jesper Check this link: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/food/practical_food_info/,0
The  vegetarian  meal in Mummbai in City Center East was vegan last year. I suppose it will be again. ^^,0
From last year's experience  I can recommend Mama's Corner (festival grounds  near Pavillion)  Mummbai (City Center East)  Haché Gourmet Burgers (L) and some restaurant inside the stables of Gloria. Haché even have two different vegetarian burgers  and Mama's Corner have the most delicious  food pancakes  with coleslaw and other things on the side! You'll have to try out these places. :D,0
You'd better hurry up if you want to camp at Get A Tent Central or if you want a reserved camping space (Get A Place N - buy 10 tickets and get a reserved space). We've only got 9 Get A Place N tickets left.  More info: http://roskil.de/rf15getatent  Photo: Khanh Gia,12
Both Get A Place N and Get A Tent Central are sold out.,0
:O,0
Hi Oliver   The area is called Get A Place N and is located next to the East 1 entrance. You can't book two areas next to each other. You will just have to get there early to make sure you get the areas you want. See map: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ra78q6nud5blsxu/map-2015.pdf?dl=0,0
Is it possible to arrive the 28th of june and still have the 10x10 meter in N waiting for us? Roskilde Festival,0
Emil  if you book the Get A Place N  there will be an area waiting for you when you get to the festival.,0
Today we announce DEAD SKELETONS (Official page)  Sivert Høyem  Niki And The Dove and :Of The Wand & The Moon: Official who add Nordic darkness and magic to the Roskilde 2012 lineup.  http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/nordic-music-acts-to-play-roskilde-festival-2012/  Thanks to everyone who played our little guessing game yesterday. The songs we mashed up were:  Dead Skeletons:  Dead Mantra  Niki & The Dove:  The Fox  Of The Wand & The Moon:  Absence  Sivert Høyem:  Blown Away ,10
(Y),0
Ååh sivert høyem:-D,0
sivert in my <3,0
Why even bother with teasers? ,0
Rasmus Uhrenfeldt  what are you talking about?,0
Rasmus - then don't participate  if you're that cynical.,0
Peter: Dan Turell was a genius :)   Yeah  !!! plays punk-funk. Folk noir makes a great deal of sense to me as a genre. You have brighty  poppy folk – stuf like Fleet Foxes springs to mind – and then the darker  broodier stuff. Folk noir seems a fitting label to that.,0
Peter Andersen  back in those days genres were more clearly defined. Today everything melts together  and I'm sure Dan Turell would have loved it if he were still among us.,0
love the haters,0
I'm not protesting  just smiling quietly ) Anyway  Fleet Foxes are simply folk music to me  not  folk light  or  happy folk   and the noir-thing just sounds a little pretentious,0
Dead Skeletons! Niki & The Dove!,0
Of The Wand And The Moon <3 Thanks  Roskilde :),0
Steve Gode and Daniel Isbjørnen Adrian  may I suggest you go to sleep instead of telling us you're sleepy. Go find that positive energy :-),0
Niki & The Dove one right! awesome band!! thanks!,0
Cecilie  may I suggest you go there if you prefer their lineup,0
I will  but please! Been going to Roskilde for years  and i'm not planning on stopping  bring on some headliners!,0
With about 200 acts in total  they can't all be major,0
YEEEEESSS !!! Niki & The Dove !!! So gooood ! Missed them at the last Iceland Airwaves festival ! Now there are two bands playing that I missed at earlier festivals (Missed Friendly Fires in Roskilde 2009),0
i'm starting to feel real sorry for the guy who lost his field to this.....,0
OF THE WAND AND THE MOON!!!! Endelig åbner vi vores øjne herhjemme.,0
Dead Skeletons is a really great booking. I don't know Sivert Hoyem  but he sounds very very nice! Looking forward to discover his music later today!  Thank you  Roskilde <3,0
:Of The Wand & The Moon: FINALLY!!!!!!!! <3 Thanks Roskilde!!!,0
Dennis Eckhof  we've missed your cheerful comments.,0
Yep i'm back. More cheerfull than ever!,0
I guess what annoys me is you announce Springsteen  we all get excited about what may follow  then its 80% bands only the most diehard fans would know then a couple of more  headliners  who would be playing mid afternoon at Big Day Out. I was just looking forward to a great festival full of great bands that I know. The line up so far is like our Laneway Festival where the bands are very good  but not really catering to the mainstream indie fan.,0
Only one Canadian act so far. What about another - Crystal Castles mabye? :):):):),0
Which time will you release the bands? ,0
The big show is around April 19th  other than that  they release new bandnames every once in a while :),0
so cannot wait for Roskilde now roll on summer :D please bring deadmau5 back also some skrillex ,0
I think 3LAU will be a good dj'ish artist for Roskilde Festival like Deadmau5 last year! :),0
Have you any more info on Camper Van tickets? We are going on a one day ticket and ideally want to camp within the festival at the end of the night. Thanks,0
Hi Simon.  Add ons such as caravan will be available sometime during March. Sign up for our newsletter or keep an eye on our Facebook page to stay up to date.,0
New service  only for German visitors:,0
There is no refund on any pavilions/gazabos.  We had it back in 2011 - but it didn't really work out as intended.,0
Don't worry... our tents can withstand the most rain. Not that it's needed  of course :-),0
Do I have to print out the ticket  or can I show it on iphone/ipad?,0
Hello Roskilde. Since you write everything on facebook in english  and ever answer people who writes in danish in english  why not make the news paper available in english?   I remember a couple of years ago  the paper used to come in two versions  one in danish and one in english  and that was very appreciated!,0
I would buy it,0
You're right  we really should. And hopefully we will again. Unfortunately  it won't be in 2013.,0
That really sucks.. Not even a summary in english on the bigger articles?,0
that would be weird when it is free,0
sense when?,0
One way to spend a Friday night at Roskilde...,22
Catch me on the opposite side of the festival area.,0
Ooooor ... not.,0
Such a fucking awesome gig at Wacken 2012!,0
but crystal castles is playing on arena!!,0
Crystal castles is where the party will be :D,0
Weird day for musical genres on Orange Stage that day with both Rihanna and Volbeat! Awesome!,0
Hell yeah! :D,0
*The best way to spend a Friday night! :D,0
W:O:A / Roskilde <3,0
Mirco will be there!,0

OMG they un-tight  guitars and drums are so off and far away from each other!,0
was there too  one of the best gigs of the festival,0
you too,0
yes i will be there as well,0
You should ask them yourself. Who knows  maybe you'll have your request fulfilled...,0
i have.... but i am just a member of Camp Wolfpack.  i have very little power!  :)    although if they don't ... it is still going to be awesome!  see you in 13 days!,0
Last year our most musical festival-goers recorded this true 80s-band-aid-style song. With a CLEAN message.  Wanna record your own music at Roskilde 2013? Visit 4Sound's Demolab in our Sonic Zone and release it through WiMP.,11
Wuhuuu  Orange stage opener right there :-),0
Where can I download this?,0
hey roskilde would you please ask rihanna play this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kv3BkWnhIc  thanks <3 xoxo hunnie,0
Would you please ask Rihanna not to play?,0
when will you be able to enter the festival without entrance booking ?,0
i can tell you that mr. freyr! The booking process is only necessary on the first day of the festival  i.e. from Saturday 29 June at 18:00 to Sunday 30 June at 08:00. Afterwards we reduce the number of entrances to three (entrance Easat  West as well as the entrance by the festival train station)  and everybody with a valid festival ticket can get access through all entrances.,0
Hi you. It's not sold out yet  but it's close. So go and get your entrance booking asap!,0
Yo! Will there be a place where the EURO 2016 will be shown? ???????,0
Sorry  no,0
 Rikke is always willing to pitch in extra hours in the kitchen  even when she's off duty. She is always in a great mood and creates a super spirit amongst our team.   Roskilde Festival and Tuborgfondet celebrate the heroes who make an extra effort for others and make Roskilde Festival an even better festival. Among all nominees we will find five people whose name will be carved in orange-coloured stone and placed in front of Orange Stage.   Nominate your Roskilde hero - take a photo  share it on Instagram along with a description of that special deed using #RFHero.   2016 will be Rikke's 12th year as a volunteer. She was nominated by René.,0
I did the useual 36. Then 54 more hours last year ?,0
Hi I was wondering about this years charity  can you be more specific then on your website. The reason I ask is becuse a dare friend past away this weekend. He loved Roskilde festival and this year would have been his eight time in nine years. His parents wanted us to find a charity we could donate to in his name  something he would vauch for. He always talked warm and supportive of your non-profit work  so I am hoping you could send me some information. You may send it to me in a private message if you will. Thank you,0
Dear Roskilde  I would love to see Triggerfinger at Roskilde. Check out their Rihanna cover!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXtb4El_aws&feature=youtu.be,0
Skrillex on Orange stage! please!,0
Groundation should come!,0
Take a look at one of the oldest restaurant at the Roskilde Festival! The Golden Bean is one of the best vegetarian restaurants on the festival because we make almost all of our food from scratch!,0
Where do you plan to camp?  View the map in hi-res (pdf): http://ow.ly/lUmh2 For more practical stuff: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/,73

Please add Sleater-Kinney to the line up! :-),0
Sub Motion are a band not to be missed check them out,0
When will you put up the application form for volunteer duties at the festival?,0
Longing for the Orange feeling again!!!,0

Hey Roskilde Festival here is one more to your collection:  Ps: it's Tuborg of cause!,0
Pleases book Paul McCartney and Blur please :),0
Hello  is it a problem if there is a very slight typing eror on my name for my ticket? bought my ticket and accidentally added a 'q' to my name so it reads dawnq. oops.. help! :),0
Yes  what Anders said.  Dawnq may be your new hip-hop moniker?,0
Put a Dawnq on it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckMvj1piK58,0

Alice Cooper will be in Finnland few days before Roskilde. Please book him to Roskilde this summer :) ,0
Not gonna happen,0
Have a great breakfast everyone!!!,0
dlaczego to jedzenie nie przeszlo przez Instagram? pytam sie!,0
What is orange feeling to you?,37
The best feeling in the world  its music  alcohol  sun  friends and raging endorfins,0
Death & destruction... The end of days...,0
Not a care in the world! Just hanging out in the sun listening to good music!,0
A temporary - but luckily - a regular beautiful utopia on earth.,0
Not giving a fuck for a whole week!,0
My ass  my ass is feeling orange right now... Also  oranges feel orange  but that's just because I associate the texture with the color.,0
This http://youtu.be/5EiEUxWwB3M,0
Everytime i hear that song.  Goosebumps.,0
Being with my Vikings who I only get to see once a year at Roskilde. Our camp life is the best. With Jens Olsen  The Black ninja  Pernille Stanley.  The Nillo . VB Thommo. Jacob Anhøj. And the whole week of fun. RF13. Get ready.,0
It (well  most of it) sounds great! Keep it coming...,0
The orange feeling to me is freedom  tolerence and love... That we for 9 days can be who we really are and be accepted for  exactly that. That you can enjoy life  your friends and the great experiences that always will come to you at Roskilde!,0
I promise not to throw orange tear gas at Roskilde. But perhaps I will dress up as an orange penguin.??? :D <( ),0
 How is Roskilde for you outside of the season?  51 weeks of loneliness  existensial fear and depression.  Lingering for the grave... But!!! Just. One. More. Roskilde! That's pretty orange right there :O,0
Nikolaj  that's more like it.,0
Being yourself and a part of something bigger at the same time <3,0
..and certainly better than lemon  -),0
many miles from Argentina to go to roskilde!,0
Peace  love and harmoni = Orange feeling <3,0
My life for 20 years?,0
Lying in the grass somewhere around the orange stage in the afternoon listening to the soothing tones of some great band and get hammered on Tuborg!,0
Sex  beer and rock n' roll !!!,0
Okay. Okay. You guessed it. Yes yes yes. I can't live without the Orange feeling. Waiting and looking every day. Only 364. That was the day after now only 19. I crave for the sight and smell of. Scream for me Martoskiplanderviking Roskilde Cook,0
The first hour of my arrival to the festival.,0
just to be there ..is the greztest Orange Feeling    to be your angel..The word <Here and <<<now ...,0
Feeling safe and loved.,0
Hi there. As soon as possible  we're working on it! :),0
Please book Blur to Roskilde Festival :),0
Hello when will the schedule be ready ??,0
Thanks for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. I hope you will also book Blur  Alice Cooper  Paul McCartney  Black Sabbath or System of a Down  Scorpions and The Who. Yeah could be awesome to have these to Roskilde this summer :),0
We're just luring you in :-),0
I know !! and its working...!!! :D  but I cant go to roskilde this year and I want to die !!! :'(,0
How about NO?  -),0
I swear I will be back!!! I loved working as a volunteer!. Ah those memories building this place   sniff sniff :(((((,0
What is orange feeling to you?,37
How to spend Friday night at Roskilde...,26
An alternative way to spend it is first to go and see Devin Townsend Project  then Kreator  and finally Volbeat. :-),0
I will encourage everyone to throw things at her.,0
What the heck has happened to my dear  old rock n roll Roskilde?? :-(,0
Metal is fine! But when artist like Rhianna appears...Glad I experienced Roskilde before this tragic anti-music came to be.. :-/,0
I have not even looked at the bandlist BUT Rhianna drags it way down. My personal opinion.,0
Suck Donni... You know exactely what I mean  but go on  for the sake of God :-D,0
Mads  you're out of here! Encouraging people to throw stuff at a performing artist is just not cool. We'll IN NO WAY tolerate such behaviour in here.,0
We found this one because it shows how she can pull off a festival gig plus it's in HD. Feel welcome to post other clips.,0
Well Anna: I am glad that I still get to experience this excellent festival. The good thing this year that if you are a bit fond of music and different genres  there are so many nice bands to go and watch. Be it Rihanna or not I will for certain not get bored during the festival (actually I almost get stress by looking at the  my schedule ). In addition to the already extremely nice schedule Roskilde Festival also gave  me  my favourites from Metallica. Oh that orange feeling.,0
Okay  -). THANX by the way for headlining her. Gonna be awesome.,0
Sounds like a plan to me!,0
I actually planned to go seeing her ... but this video made me change my mind - sorry - but this was dead awful  boring and embarrasing really ... you need to find a better clip guys :/,0
Its not really in HD is it?... and for me this shows the exact opposite that she sucks at a festival gig,0
Tinderbox has The Prodigy you need to snap up The Chemical Brothers  Sigma and Faithless  -),0
Wishes for artists  Daniel Romano and Phosphorescent,0
http://youtu.be/-wFnfd_ODkk  Wouldn't mind seeing Death Grips.... or Hella.,0
I just saw (the full  whole and complete) wu tang clan is coming to Oslo in summer. Roskilde  if you wanna attract the hiphop crowd  book wutang!,0
They're already booked to another Danish festival and thus won't appear at Roskilde.,0
How come i can't choose entrance when i try to order with flexpay?,0
Hi Lasse  You can't choose an entrance when you order a Flexpay ticket. You will be able to get your entrance booking later. We can't give you a date yet  but sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date:  http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2015,0
Ok. I was told that i couldnt choose entrance as soon as i completed the full down-payement.. Is this correct  or is it going to be available some time soon like you say?,0
Mastodon  Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds  Kygo  First Aid Kit (SE) OFFICIAL and 20 more to play #RF15. Press play to see them all.  78 out of 169 acts announced so far.  Get your ticket here: www.roskilde-festival.dk,162
KYGOO Thea HS :D,0
disaapointed  what's with all this metal?,0
Thx for Mastodon and First Aid Kit,0
FUCKING BIKSTOK!!! :D :D :D,0
Roskilde Festival I understand know why you did´t want to bet that beer yesterday,0
91 more bands to be announced  calm yourselves. I'm sure there's something for everyone.,0

Beyond Pink better not be the 'punk' name promised. For starters they're not even part of the genre  secondly they are absolutely terrible. Bring back NOFX please. Or Lagwagon. Or even Millencolin. Or how about A Wilhelm Scream? Rancid? Mxpx? New Found Glory are also touring? Thrice has reunited as well. Please stop ignoring this genre!!!!,0
Ina Dannesboe Larsen Katrine Svendsen Stine G. Stryhn KYGOO!! :O:D,0
Sha Ne kygos playing this year....,0
Simon Hjetting FUCKING TOLD YOU BROTHER,0
First aid Kit :O Carla Juhl Mathilde Pedersen Thilde Barfod,0
Hail the Great Mastodon??,0
MAD FER IT! Tak for Noel  Roskilde. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzQYtpjMjSo,0
Esben Holdt Rude KYGO! Jonas Petri FIRST AID KIT! :D,0
Excellent! Fossils at Roskilde at long last! :D It's shaping up to be another great year!,0
Underwhelming is properly the feeling I'm left with after half the names are puplished - There is maybe 3 acts or so in there that I would buy a ticket to go see - Realy hope for something good in the 2nd half or this might be the first time since 04 I'm not gonna go - can't even beare to think about that :s,0
Sign up RIDE for f**k's sake!!!,0
I think an oldie such as Kiss would have a huge applaud if they came  considering they are an old band whom most have heard of but not heard that much.  Otherwise I'd be very happy to see more danish metal / alternative rock bands such as Raunchy or Mercenary.   At the very least  please invite The Unguided (even though they're swedish  but you get the point),0
No Rob Zombie??,0
Have we seen the biggest names yet?,0
That was a bullshit announcement. Hoping for better next time around. That said looking forward to seeing First Aid Kit and Jamie xx.,0
Thanks for a lot of exciting acts to look forward to  by now I can see that I'm gonna get a really busy schedule this Summer. However  I'm stuck with the desire to see Mötley Crüe at their final tour. I see that they have a   gig hole  between June 14 at Donnington Park (festival gig)  and July 22 in Oregon - so it might be possible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo8B5bv6V8U,0
Well there's a whole lot of bands I've never heard of. Those are usually the best!,0
Emilie My  klar?,0
Ed Sheeran  Faithless  J.Cole  Stereophonics  The Chemical Brothers  Blur  Paloma Faith  Sigma  Kaiser Chiefs  Childish Gambino would do nicely  -),0
This tent canvas is in fact white - the lighting makes it blue. Back in the day the canvas WAS green (and the stage name was Green Stage)  but when the canvas broke and the new one we got was white  the time seemed fit for a name change.,0
Oh give in and Hire Me !!!    I loved my few hours there last Summer  Got to see the Kings Of Leon...Now I'm a fan BUTTTTTTTTTTTTT I'd Love to be on one of your smaller stages there...My whole point in coming to Denmark last summer  was to score Festivals in Denmark & Europe !!! Smile MB NYC  ,0
I m hoping for some big rock and metal acts :),0
You will get Mastodon... which according to Roskilde is a big metal act (headliner last time),0
I remember Mastodon headline last time in 2011.,0
It was weird then and would still be weird if they headline again.,0
True. I want big metal like Judas Priest  System Of A Down and Black Sabbath.,0
hi  looking for italians guys for camping and enjoy festival i'm newbie....bigupppp,0
I think that Kenton Slash Demon is rather unpleased by their music-example in your iOS-app... Unless ofcourse they really enjoy german schlager...,0
Dream City Weekly Challenge #3: City Hall Event. Plan an event for the Dream City Hall! The Dream City Hall must have content that moves  debates that stretch the limits  and presentations that open eyes!  What would be a great event in the Dream City Hall?,6
TENACHIOUS D,0
Those bands will probably not fit in the Dream City Hall! We are looking for people who have great ideas for events  and who want to contribute to Dream City!,0
I know  i just love them,0
The Dream City Hall could host events such as:                                        - Juggling Sessions                                                                                 - Debates on how to improve public transportation                                                                                                - Capoeira dance lessons!                                                                      - A workshop on embroidery                                                                    There are no limits - what would you like to do at the City Hall?,0
Street art workshops - new innovative ways to make a small contributions in your city by small means.,0
Debatehour - set up a board where people can write down different ideas and let a deabteleader start a new debate every 1 minutes or so - everything goes!,0
What about a small art-exhibition? With pictures of your favorite spot in your home town...,0
Eduardo Alarcon Klein Alexander Aleg-One Kolby Those are really great ideas. And probably more realistic! In Dream City everything is possible so go to http://dc.roskilde-festival.dk/ideas/25 and upload your ideas - and help make it happen! Maybe you want to host the event your self or somebody else will pick up your idea...,0
it could be fun to do an event where you combine some of the awesome chemical reactions  that chemistry show (from Aalborg university)  make with a dj so that we time the music with eksplotions  color changing liquids  fire and foam eruptions  but it would take a lot of worke to do,0
Roskilde Festival http://dc.roskilde-festival.dk/ideas/26 there you go  vote it up and maybe we eachother there=),0
So it's today we're gonna see a new teaser. Let's see if you guys are making it harder this time around  ) ,0
Make it happen. We're ready for you!,0
At 17:00 the challenge will be online,0
buuuh! :) What the hell am I supposed to do up till then?? Work?!?!,0
Exchanging creative ideas  listening to Amon Tobin and wearing a Norsestore beanie is kinda work?,0
Aleg - pumping weights to get ready for the fight at Norma Jean tonight maybe?  ),0
I'll just be wearing an armor. Just in case. I'm kinda frightened....,0
Fair enough. I have a couple of hours to kill by then :),0
Get swedish house mafia and de lyckliga kompisarna to roskilde,0

Ain't touring.,0
Before people ask for act it s always good to check it out if the band or artist is touring or not hehe,0
well  again: any news regarding the h&m reboot camp 2012? last year it was announced in march i think....,0
Yes  this week! Keep an eye on the website.,0
Finally a new song out from The Tallest Man On Earth. He plays a Scandinavian-exclusive festival gig at Roskilde Festival.,2
Yes! See this: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4224,0
I was born that year. Oldschool :-),0
Hi Pernille. That's a good idea! We'll find out and get back to you.,0
Hi again. Street city will not be showing X Games  sorry.,0
Okay. But thanks for looking into it:-),0
Hello. I won these two tickets to roskilde festival.   I just cant figure which entrance they are for?   It's  The make an even bigger difference ticket  where can i get information of the entrance?  Daniel,0
You should have a stand alone ticket if it has a entrance bookning,0
when will the cinema program be announced to those of us who were not in Grand yesterday?,0
Hi Michael   We will look into it. Thanks for your inputs.,0
If we come down on Tuesday around 15 pm and want three mediumtent next to each other  do you think it works or is it a high risk of ending up at a distance from each other?,0
I wouldn't count on it.,0
Too cool! Can we re-post your photo?,0
When will the free parking areas open?,0
Will the Apollo stage be moving around during the warm up days again this year  or will it be in one place? I've heard both  not sure which is true. If it stays  where will it be?,0
Dear Roskilde - The band program is really awesome this year  but the band schedule is really really bad. I don't know how to say this  but I've been coming at the festival for 15 years  and this is probably one of the most complicated and overlapping band schedules i've seen.  It's the big things like Dislosure  Mykki Blanco and Animal Collective at ones  while nothing is really playing at 00 hours that thursday. Then on friday you have El-P and Den Sorte Skole at the same time  which I bet a majority of the same people would like to see. Saturday is the worst  where it's like kenton-slash-deamon vs efterklang  Indians vs. the national and angel haze vs. chase and status vs. when saints go machine. Yes this is a status of my taste which yeah is around electronica/hiphop/indie stuff  but what I find evident is that there are so many holes in the program  why I simply don't understand that the time division is so thin. One hour makes a hell of a lot of difference  if you like me try to get to see at least half of the bands u want to see + the band/artists that always comes along as surprises. My request is just for you guys to make  at least some sort of evaluation of those time schedules in the future  to avoid too many overlaps.  ,0
Chinese man vs. Kendrick Lamar Orgi-E (F1RSTEHOLDET) vs. Queens of the Stone Age Rihanna,0
Orgi-E and Queens of the Stone Age are two totally different acts from two totally different genres due to that you can expect acts like these don't clash.,0
Ha ha Kim Elberg you are sweet <3,0
Devin Townsend Project will play Roskilde Festival 2013.  Prepare for a hard-rocking show full of edge  humour  quirky genre meltdowns and corny pop music.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/devin-townsend-project-to-play-roskilde-festival-2013/  We have also made some small adjustments in the band schedule. Download fresh edition here: http://ow.ly/lIIJL,65
I don't understand WHY you have chosen to close Roskilde Cinema. Watching movies in the cold tent was the best cure against hangovers  and often there was a big line outside to get in. WHY!!,0
1995: Ice T 1996: Cypress Hill 1997: Wu-Tang Clan 1998: The Beastie Boys  A Tripe Called Quest  1999: The Roots 2000: :i 2001: Mos Def 2002: P.

Hey! When will there be the big release of artists? Some wednesday in april?,0
I've heard the 19th of April.,0
How about booking Radiohead for sunday or thursday? :),0
I think Radiohead has those days reserved as  off  days in their schedule. If they were to fill them out  they'd have to play either five or six days in a row  which would be kind of unusual for a band of their size.,0
You're probably right. Would be awesome to see them though. Missed them in 2008.,0
Imagine having your name carved in stone in front of Orange Stage (Hollywood Walk of Fame-style). Now you can!  Together with Tuborgfondet we're looking for the heroes of Roskilde.

Hi there. We hooked up with Ants who facilitates rideshares. Go and have a look. http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/travel/roskilde_rideshare/,0
To all of you Volbeat and Airbourne fans. I can promise you one thing: They will not disappoint after their respective live shows at Rock am Ring in Germany! :) ,0
Get ready some summer SUUNS -- performing live on July 5th at Roskilde Festival!,0
The program was looking really disappointing a few months ago. You guys did a completely awesome job of fixing that. Well done!,0
Am I missing something? or was anyone else expecting more from this announcement?,0
give me the 24 acts and give it to me now. :-),0
Book Richie Hawtin! He is in Sweden June 31!!!!!!!!!!,0
just wondering if roskilde is ready to take an different direction next time  im not critical but hip hop and metal is just not my cup of tea,0

We never encourage getting tattoos  but on this fine Friday we thought we'd make a little Roskilde tattoo gallery for you. Do you have a Roskilde tattoo as well - post it on our wall and we'll include it in the gallery. Have a nice weekend!,3
Always encourage! :D,0
that's how you do social media!,0
why not? and by posting that album you endorse it. quite contradicting imo.,0
Oh hello. I see my arm... ,0
Roskilde Labs is turning ideas into apps. The four winners of the idea contest have been found and Roskilde Labs is ready to enter the next phase turning ideas into apps. Are you up for a challenge?  Go to Roskilde Labs and release your inner app developer! http://labs.roskilde-festival.dk/,4
Morten Lund  see it as a service offer. Yes  you use battery when you use your phone. That's a given. But many many people appreciate these apps.,0
Morten Lund: There are other ways to recharge your phone  you know. There are battery packs allowing you for full recharges whenever you need it and solar rechargers. It all boils down to how practically minded you are about it.,0
Guess it's also about the cost-benefit-enviroment aspects of it?,0
Well  if you're using a solar charger  I don't see the environmental footprint getting any worse.   In fact  that would maybe be a novel idea for a piece of Roskilde merch. A Roskilde-branded solar charger for smartphones. Most use a USB plug of some sorts so it'll be pretty universal.,0
There's also the fitness bike chargers :),0
Klaus Kokholm Petersen  we're working on the wifi hotspots. And 3G coverage will hopefully also improve.,0
But Anders  have you ever tried these solar chargers? They can hardly be said to work... Had one that could hardly manage to keep to phone running while charging...,0
Morten: One of the guys from our camp ran one last year. Worked fine. I think he went to get his phone charged at the stalls once during the festival – probably the day the weather was  less nice  – the rest of the festival he relied on the solar charger afaik.   The  you get what you pay for  rule of thumb is relevant here  aswell as some looking around for the chargers that work well as opposed to the cheap shit  some vendors are trying to push.  Here's a starting point: http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/product-reviews/eco-friendly-products/portable-solar-panels#slide-1,0
Most solar phone-chargers are a complete waste of money. The technology just isn't mature yet.,0
Get something like this while waiting for usable & affordable solar chargers:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/TeckNet®-Dual-Port-Universal-Incredible-Blackberry/dp/B000NDQ92W/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1331914358&sr=8-8 All the usual tips for saving energy apply: turn off Bluetooth  wi-fi etc when not in use. And consider turning it off once in a while.,0
Hello  looking for 1 or 2 south entrance passes if anyone is selling them! please and thank you :),0

I think everybody bought their tickets just to see Ondatropica  who are actually playing Friday not Saturday. So there´s lots of people with tickets for wrong day.,0
You are acting weird now  have you had a Poison Apple of the Uncle?,0
They play Sunday.,0

I don't. But I want to see Sigur Rós! No clash for me. :D,0

Sad news: The Dillinger Escape Plan won't be able to make it to Roskilde Festival 2013.  More info below.,30
Hope you Are gonna måle up for this!!!,0
Well  I guess you'll have to book Gojira then..,0
Bahhhh... Damn shame  would have loved to see them live. So i guess that means you are going to bring in another metal act?,0
well.. you could say that their escape plan worked :D,0
Give us the only band that is crazier than TDEP. They call us  The Chariot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ermp7sY3UIY,0
Worst news ever. Fuck  I hope you find a decent replacement.,0
that really sucks,0
Daft Punk is not realistic. RODRIGUEZ - In Denmark  Touring and Ready.. !,0
Get Stone Sour to replace them. You've already half the band playing with masks thursday night.,0
Frende Steinsnes Ingvald RossebøJørgen DahlErik Stinson Nævdal :D<3,0
Make up for a broken hand?  We'll do our best to find another hard-hitting band.,0
http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn84/Wolf-Assassin/you-have-failed-please-die.png,0
That's what we aim at.,0
May i then suggest Gorod. They're awesome live  and have recently put out an excellent album :),0
This guy,0
Birds of Sulphur \M/,0
Gojira are having a break in touring around RF... however that does also mean  that they are not booked!,0
but yeah... get Gojira instead.. then you are forgiven,0
They're playing Warped Tour the entire summer.,0
Always hard to have a good replacement so near the Festival. Cause the new act gotta play at the same time during the festival. :/,0
I know  but fingers crossed :),0
Like you already - Meet you there Trine Maria Kaulberg ? :),0

Remember to cross-check with the cities the acts are from: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152510419011706,0
U had to ruin my hype didn't u? <3,0
Lets hope so,0
Nope  their #1 song is Freak on a leash.,0
Seems about right.,0
Nope  None with five or seven letters (Song 2 or Song Two  depending on how you choose to see it),0
Oh good. I didnt really wanna see Korn... Im not 17 anymore :),0
Isnt Killing in the name of?,0
Although it doesn't quite work if 9 across is  If I Had A Gun  by Noel Gallagher.,0
Then i hoping for  Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds,0
Anton Levinsen Eskild Cold Johannes D. Schackinger,0
I really hope the last comment is wrong about Nicki Minaj. That would be such a waste of stage  time and money. That might even push me closer to buying a ticket for Tinderbox instead. :(,0
Eight across could be Spooks  by Jonny Greenwood.,0
Same nok..,0
Fourteen across could be Danko Jones - Had Enough.,0
No fucking way!! :O,0
He's from Florida,0
I hope it is not Mark Ronson. One hit wonder crap and i hate this song so much.,0
Yeah I figured that out. Bummer :(,0
Damn it! ??,0
To be fair  dude has quite a few hits to his name. But he wouldn't be top of my list either.,0
Atli: He is definitely NOT a one hit wonder. If he was  you might have to reconsider quite a few of your own favorites too. I loathe funk and was thus very skeptical of the album  which completely convinced me. He's a very solid booking  if Aksel is right.,0
Jaaa taaak! But is Galvanize really the most popular song by the Chems?,0
Mari Berntsen lemme just pull a manager card out of my sleeve,0
The most popular song is Last Nite,0
The number 1 song is reptilia,0
on spotify,0
Yes it is,0
Fits with 14 Rush - Tom Sawyer,0
If you put it In 11 instead of 18! Won't fit 18 cause 21 is Mastodon - The Motherload  for sure!,0
Alright  I hope it's one of those,0
I just hate this song and i hope we will not play Roskilde this summer.,0
They are from Bristol. Would be awesome though.,0
But you are looking at Reptilia as the number 1 song,0
not on my spotify,0
Maybe hey boy hey girl.  They have so many classics tho,0
Number 12 are with 5 letters!,0
Hoping for Blur as well,0
But it isn't five letters distributed on two words. It's five letters in one word. The title isn't 'Song2'.,0
if this is true Lovisa Tryggsäter Cleo Boland Nermina Šaric,0
Peter Binne Larsen! :O,0
Please don't,0
I'm 99% on First Aid Kit. Their matching tattoos are mentioned in the hint video too.,0
dude I realy hope its Rush!,0

If you have any questions please contact  handicapservice@roskilde-festival.dk    Application form: https://roskilde.s3.amazonaws.com/1729/handicapservice-procedure.docx  FAQ: https://roskilde.s3.amazonaws.com/1730/handicapservice-faq.docx,0

dear roskilde people  this is a letter to you all both behind and in front of the scene. i was there in 2009. me  serpil from istanbul  a girl  all alone  in that huge festival. i was so determined to come to roskilde that finding no friends to go with couldn't stop me. so there i was. but not alone. not at all. every single one was so friendly that i didn't feel alone. that taking care of eachother philosophy  those people who are open to make friends  those people who doesn't leave you till they're convinced that you're fine when they see you down  all those jolly people that makes life jolly. i am proud of myself to find the balls to go there alone  because roskilde festival added so much to me. i remember thinking  this is a huge jolly crowd. a huge jolly drunk crowd. if this huge drunk crowd was in my country  it wouldn't be that jolly. because my people is high tempered  because my people is uncomfortable  because my people doesn't know how to be jolly   i thought. well i thought wrong apparently. maybe you've heard the occupygezi movement in istanbul. it's been more than 10 days that people are resisting. if anybody among you knows taksim square there are barricades now to keep police behind. this movement started to save the gezi park as a park because in name of gentrification they started to abuse the city culture  building shopping malls and skyscrapers everywhere and the plan was turning the park into a concrete building. this movement started to save 'a bunch of trees' in gezi park. this movement started to stand for people's right to have parks. but it went further. it turned into something bigger. and most importantly it awakened the souls that are free. it cracked the society walls. it cracked the stiffness. i was in taksim square yesterday. and i remembered what i thought when i was at roskilde. because yesterday taksim could be sized up for amount of people and for amount of drunkness at roskilde. and imagine even more cosmopolit then roskilde. yet it felt like roskilde. since we built up the barricades against the authority  we broke down our barricades against 'the other'. since 2009 i've been missing this roskilde mood. thank you people those who make roskilde festival as it is to be such a touchstone of easiness and contentment. i just wanted to share my feelings. have fun!  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=395081073943640&set=a.390123017772779.1073741828.390109394440808&type=1&ref=nf,0
All dressed up and SOMEWHERE to go (soon)  -),0
Taken yesterday on a roadtrip to Roskilde to scout the campsite and Dream City.  Taken at Gate6  looking at the Arena/Green-area.  There's a huge animal exhibition this weekend.,0
The smell was about the same though,0
Just book her. Just do it. Do it. It. (she wants to),0
Don't forgett to check out Benevolent. Awesome Gothenburg metalsludge. Next stop Roskilde-festival?,0
How about King Diamond Volbeat and D.A.D?Three danish acts who are actually good -),0
http://soundcloud.com/djmarbeck1/set-march-2012-by-marcelo free download. enjoy..,0
Gogol Bordello will play Rock In Rio in Madrid on july 7. I hope we will also get them to Roskilde :),0
Patti Smith to Roskilde 2012!!!,0
Probably time to book Napalm Death. New record out. And they're one of the best livebands i've ever seen!,0
also the loudest I've ever seen!!,0
have'nt You seen motörhead? They are loud!,0
Hello Roskildefest!! I was there last year  I would like to propose the idea of a 'Roskilde 5' street football tournament  I think it would be a pretty sweet idea for the warm up days....what do you think?,0
I think there's some kind of tournament but it's girls only for whatever reasons. I could imagine myself participating in a tournament like you're proposing.,0
That doesn't seem fair...I'd be happy to try and organise it properly if there was interest,0
I totally agree and i have already suggested that before  but i didn't get the best response on that idea i think.,0
You should ask your organisation to send us an application. Here's the link (in Danish): http://roskilde-festival.dk/om_festivalen/foreningen_roskilde_festival/,0
Whats wrong with it? It lists everything day by day in time order or by stage,0
We want Blur to Roskilde this summer :),0
You will make me and lot people happpy if you could book Blur to Roskilde Festival this summer :),0
Of Monsters and Men?Fits the tour schedule nicely ...,0
The War on Drugs kommer  så dont count on it ??,0
So what is it us  the fans  the attenders  will have to do for the arrangers to charm NiN into showing up this year?,0
I´m wondering a bit about the terms for the ride share thing you have with Ants. It says we will be contacted when our car has  more than three passangers   does that mean 3 passangers or more or does it mean 4 passangers or more? I dont think our car will fit more than three passangers.. And is there still free tickets to be claimed for ride sharers? We have a full car now anyway  going from northern sweden. 20 days and counting!!,0
Sigur Ros has to play at Orange  it's gonna come way too many people for the show to be any enjoyable if you're not up front. Please  Roskilde!,0
Hey! I have been looking for info about this for hours now  but can't seem to find any. Air mattresses. in 2014 i think I bought my tent with two air mattresses. This was not an option this year(?). Anyway  is it possible to buy air mattresses at the Special Camping East (where I'm picking up my tent)? Do you have many/few? Do you think I will be able to buy two if I arrive with the Entrance Booking-gang? Sorry for a complicated question! :D,0
Perhaps this is the offer you're looking for: https://www.spejdersport.dk/Pages/Search.aspx?search=festival%20pakker,0
Yes  perfect  thank you!,0
Does anyone have space for three people in a car? Willing to pay a reasonable fee :-),0
Have a look here (you can switch language in the upper right corner): https://gomore.dk/roskilde,0
Also new album from Blur. Please book Blur to Roskilde Festival :) ,0
any news?,0
If Blur will tour. Then book them to Roskilde this summer Please :) https://www.facebook.com/gigaddicts/photos/a.170948333113286.1073741828.164550977086355/333144673560317/?type=1&theater,0
When I add a favorite from the website or mobile it does not sync between the two. Is there a problem or is it just for me it does not work?,0
Is camping area H not available for regular camping this year? :(((,0
Well  those were some pretty odd replies. Is it? :S,0
Camping area H is Dream City this year  so a lot of groups are already out there building their camp  but there will still be room for guests arriving Saturday :) Check out http://dc.roskilde-festival.dk for info on which spots are occupied.,0
Thank you  Steen :D,0
The program is so good but the only disapointment is tha clash with Metallica and Sigur Rós concerts. The two acts I was looking most forward to see.  See you in three weeks!,0
This might just be the best Saturday of the year.  Download schedule: http://ow.ly/lIIJL Buy your ticket: http://ow.ly/lDLxw,73
No because I'm probably going to skip Kvelertak to see Metallica from the pit! :(,0
Also the biggest clash of this year... Sigur vs Metallica >.< ... seen 'tallica 6 times  once at Roskilde  so going with Sigur,0
prøv med d. 15/6  når kongen kommer hjem. Abigail must be nailed to her coffin with 7 silver spikes...,0
Metallica! Sigur Rós! (even though they crash..) Kenton Slash Demon! Ásgeir Trausti! Truls! When Saints Go Machine! Lookin' forward aye!,0
That's right  Janne.,0
Will be there.. METALLICA (l),0
Fantastisk lørdag! :-D,0
? Not bad:),0
but very expensive too,0
Hell Yeah!!! \m/,0
METALLICA!!! :D,0
lineup sucks this year,0
Yeah as people are saying. Don't put the biggest acts you got going up at the same time in the schedule  that's just whaaaat?,0
I'm a bit annoyed with Anaal Nathrakh and the National overlapping. It would have made more sense to have Anaal overlap with someone like Rihanna because those audiences are so different.,0
Hello Roskilde. I saw that under your music-category on your homepage  under NUMBERS feat. Rustie  ONEMAN and so on... There's a link to a Hudson Mohawke song  is he playing with them??,0
Should switch Sigur with Chase & Status and I'll be happy :),0
The program is so good but the only disapointment is tha clash with Metallica and Sigur Rós concerts. The two acts I was looking most forward to see.,0
me too :(,0
If they didn't  both bands would play for overcrowded stages. They did it intentionally so the audience will be spread out. The did the same thing the last few years (at least)  for example last year with Bruce Springsteen and Bon Iver.,0
Plaese don't switch 'em :p I intend to see both Metallica and Chase & Status.,0
That actually is an issue... Though with a bit of luck one might be able to just barely slip into the pit after Kvelertak.,0
If I'm not mistaken it's from 5 AM to 5 AM the next day.,0
Good point  actually. (Lasse) Before that it made no such thing as sense to me.,0
This might just be the best Friday of the year.  Download schedule: http://ow.ly/lIIJL Buy your ticket: http://ow.ly/lDLxw,42
This friday is also known as the big drinking day  still possibly the best friday of the year. Not much to see music wise except for Dillinger Escape Plan!,0
If you are in the 95%who couldn't care less for Rihanna  this day is horrible.,0
Because they are bloody awesome,0
Of Monsters And men are more than enough for me to go to Roskilde Festival this year  and they'll play Friday. If you like quiet storytelling songs with a lot of wonderful melodies  you should hear them. ^^,0
Yeah this was a huge disappointment.. hopefully they will come up with something remotely close to the intensity that DEP brings...,0
This might just be the best Thursday of the year.  Download schedule: http://ow.ly/lIIJL Buy your ticket: http://ow.ly/lDLxw,18
Might? Best day of the ever... Sucks Kendrick and Chinese Man are playing at the same time tho :(,0
If it wasn't because I had to miss Slipknot  it probably would be.,0
And Jake Bugg :(,0
I'm so sorry slipknot,0
Lol :D,0
Going to see Disclosure instead?,0
I've said before and I'll say it again.. Please get Keane!!,0
http://www.rocknytt.net/festival/5016-slash-och-eagles-of-death-metal-till-hultsfred Please i hope we will get Slash to Roskilde :),0
Eagles Of Death Metal - If you haven't already booked them  then do it now. They just got confirmed for Hultsfredsfestivalen. It's the best live act i've ever seen.,0
We're sending an ambulance to Syria!,39
Mick Vestergaard Andersen  as it says  There are wounded civilians - That's who you usually help with ambulances...,0
Amazing. Should be very proud of yourselves! :) ,0
Mick  use proper language in here or go somewhere else,0
Patrick Olsen  what an insensitve remark!,0
Morten Kaltoft  generally we don't want any personal attacks in here. Feel free to disagree with what we say but use proper language. And please understand that our profits cannot be used on music. They are to be donated.,0
I can't read most of the comments here  because a lot of people are being idiotic and aren't speaking English  but I'm assuming there's some hating going on  and I don't understand why. Roskilde is all about helping good causes with it's profits. Well done!,0
Markus Bruun Rasmussen  I see your point  but it could easily go the other way. We could have a so-called 'perfect storm' where everything goes wrong: bad weather  too few people etc. That would leave us with a loss. What then? Since we have to donate all profits we can't be that risky.,0
Liam: The gist of it is that some people disagree with an ambulance doing any good at all in Syria.,0
Well the way I see it  if the ambulance saves just one life  it's worthwhile.,0
Kim Pedersen  hmm we're not quite on the same page. But it's good you have another festival you like to fall back on.,0
One of last year's major volunteer-projects,0
two doors cinema club and incubus please!!!!!,0
No need for words. This will be epic!,41
Our light designer sends you a greeting. He says he can't wait to see you again - and yeah  we're gonna make your eyes bleed! ,0
Roberto look what you are gonna miss!!!  ),0
Ashley  Jade  Laura  Sara  Jake  David this looks a bit like that rave stage at Wildlife,0
Calvin bet your choking to go ??,0
Fuck yeaaaah  I want my eyes to bleed!!,0
That's one way to get us hyped I guess.,0
Henriette  lucky you,0
Is that Apollo? ??,0
couldn't get a ticket this year :(,0
Christoffer Don Dam Jensen,0
Virginia! :O,0
Clodagh O Driscoll,0
the lasers will look awesome shooting through the rain!!,0
Not as epic as old Apollo.,0
Roskilde  any good news for us? Foo Fighters in Europe and no official gigs between 26/6-04/7  ,0
Winter is almost over and we’re really longing for summer and that special Roskilde feeling.  What’s your most treasured Roskilde Festival memory?,22
Live Shows from 1996 - back when the music programme was awesome!!,0
Sneaking off to the pond as the sun came up or moshpitting to Adrian Lux Ian Memgard memories!!!!!!!!,0
96 best line up ever RATM  N.Young  N.Cave  Bjork  D.Bowie  RHCP  Cypress Hill and few newbies: Placebo  Skunk Anansie  A.Morissette  Bush. Music and festival was never that good any more. Keep on searching for t-shirt of that year :-),0
Odeon...we miss that stage!,0
meeting the one and only Maja Åkerman tihihihi,0
The arctic monkeys on orange stage #rf14,0
Last year when I sold a spray-painted megaphone for 700kr. 2 hours later I bought a new one for 50kr.,0
My most treasured memory is actually something my friends experienced. They were walking from some party through the L area when they approached these three men. Two of the men were together  walking towards the other man coming from the opposite direction. One of the two men carried the other over his shoulders because he was too blacked out to walk on his own. The  lonely  man  who had a Durum Kebab in his hand  started shouting at the two men:  HOW OLD ARE YOU? HOW OLD ARE YOU!? . The blacked out guy had just enough time to reply:  I have just eaten a burger  before the  lonely  man decided to hit him in the face with his Durum Kebab. The men did not know each other and left the scene afterwards. Weird but very funny.,0
Silvia!! :D,0
Haha  can't wait!,0
Spot on mate :-),0
Why would you ask us if we're above the legal drinking age in a country with no legal drinking age. There are only rules about selling and serving to people under 16 and 18 respectively! :),0
It is only allowed to advertise alcohol to persons over 18 in Denmark.,0
Then the ads on tv are a bit problematic... :),0
And asking the question  Are you above the legal drinking age  still doesn't mean anything :),0
Which channel? The UK based TV3 Danmark perhaps? And at what times? It is not allowed to advertise for alcohol on Danish based TV channels during or between programs dedicated to children and adolescents. Furthermore it is usually not acceptable under current law to advertise for alcohol at broad casting times where it can be assumed that a large part of the audience would fall into either of the above mentioned categories.,0
Will Nordic Race have an  expo  in West like 2014?,0
Hi Jacques  thanks for your inquiry. We are currently planning this year's festival and it's still too soon to say anything about the specific content.,0
Please have in mind that I will be the happiest guest at Roskilde if you manage to set up a treadmill somewhere in area West. A few days after the festival I will attend a 4-day running race in the Alps. I Would love to mix both festival and keeping up in shape if possible  Please let me know  //Jacques,0
Since the last  big group of announcements  were revealed on the 29th of January I thought that it might be a new strategy to reveal a big group of acts just before the pay-days,0
that's make sense,0
The Lake was at Roskilde Festival 2014 and recorded concerts with FIRE Orchestra  Julia Holter  Skammens Vogn  The Necks and  more. Check out their playlist from Roskilde Festival 2014.,3
baby don't cry  (,0
Yes  new acts are to be announced soon!,0
How soon :) ?,0
We are still working on clearing the names  therefore we cannot provide a specific date just yet :),0
I hope some big rock and metal acts :),0
The Yoga Sun,0
He played last time in 2001 and in 99 also,0
Then it's time he's coming back to Roskilde! :),0
More dates to be announced!  From Tenacious D homepage. Let s hope for Roskilde Festival gig later on :),0
Tenacious D would be the most awesome band to see live. Almost all of my friends know all of the songs  so it'd be epic!,0
Yeah i hope we will get them to Roskilde :),0

On the Map it just says 'Special Camping' where get a tent central was last year.  Has something changed or is still in the same spot??,0
Hi Philip Special Camping Central is located between the highway and Orange Stage. Special Camping East is located near the East Entrance in area M :)  Best regards Rikke,0
Will Freddie Gibbs still play or is he still arrested?,0
We're awaiting more info,0
Will you show Euro  2016  on big tv ?,0
No,0
Sorry  no,0
Why not  ? Iceland is playing,0
#4!! If any other design wins  both the beercan and the line-up (so far) will suck  But I'll be there no mather what.,0
Have you revealed ALL the headliners?  And when do you come out with more names? :-D,0
Could you guys by any chance push Chase and Status forward one hour (or a little more). That way they won't interfere as much with When Saints Go Machine  and I will be even happier :-)  (Or maybe I could get a reason for this decision),0
Dead in the queue...,1
Would you like to be on the cover of a swiss music magazine? Then write an e-mail to: coverphoto@zoho.com  Link to the website of the magazine: http://www.rockstar.ch/  I https://j-dubois.tumblr.com/ would take the photo of you at this year's Roskilde Festival  and it would then be on the cover!  xx,0

Where is the design with the guitar strings?,0
Why the fuck wasnt this nominated????????????,0
Roskilde Festival Forum Unfortunately it did not make the cut.,0
It should have.,0
They are pretty good :3,0
Too bad  but these final 4 design are great as well!,0
Jonas O. Nyfløt There were a lot of great designs - unfortunately this one did not make the cut.,0
Guitar strings desing was the best!!!  Who chose these four?,0
Liisa Lissu Lindell Roskilde Festival and Tuborg choose the four finalists in collaboration with each other based on specific criteria.,0
Ok. Just wondering :D,0
This one was better than the rest lol,0
I tried to find future dates for the festival but with no luck. During which dates will the festival be 2016?,0
We don't have that currently. Mainly because the dates aren't really fixed. But if you want something to plan from  the last Saturday is typically (no gurantees onwards  though) the first Saturday in July.,0
Thanks! I figured as much. :) I know you probably can't answer this either  but will 2016 end on a saturday like this year or will it be sunday as previous festivals?  ),0
Stefan  you're right  it's too early to say.,0
Who's ready for METALLICA?  This is how they looked in 1986 when they visited us the first time.  Filmed in a unique shaky handheld camera-style.,27
I am :-),0
<--- This guy right over here!,0
The badass days...,0
So freaking ready!,0
Can't wait! :D,0
It really sucks.... I can't go because I already ordered a minivacation to germany right ontop of the festival... :C,0
I'm ready for Sigur Ros...,0
Are Roskilde Festival ready to get sued after Metallica?,0
I'm not ready yet as i have not packed,0
goddamn i hope the 'the good the bad and the ugly' intro is there this year.,0
For 30 min of Metallica  maybe. Im in a bit of a hurry cause of Sigur Ros!,0
Always ready for Metallica  and i Will bring My children Jon Ludvig and Camilla Ludvig as Well this time,0
I m ready and i can not wait. I saw Metallica also at Roskilde in 99 and in 2003 :),0
I was ready  until I saw they clash with sigur ros,0
Please copy the setlist from this gig :-),0
i fuld dagslys. wtf :D,0
I'll come! 1300 km in 2 days only for METALLICA!,0
Can't wait! Hoping for lots of songs from the two albums recorded in Copenhagen back in the mid-80's  Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets!  And I hope they're in the mood for some AM I Evil? when we get to the encore :). No matter what  I think we're in for one special night \m/,0
So Ready. Day shift in the accessgroup saturday switched to nightshift between friday and saturday. Which also means that I get to rock at the gate I will be guarding with Volbeat who plays at Orange at 01.00 am :-) so yeah I am ready for Metallica :-) :-) :-),0
Bla bla bla... my dick > your dick... METALLICA ROCKS!!!!,0
My first Roskilde  i saw them and it was fucking awesome :-) been there 26 times since and can't wait to see Metallica again....  Roskildeeeee,0
When ecstasy of gold hits  me be like... Ashdiwjehdjcnfkeieridbfbfoepwjebdbdjwidifi Metallica is f**king awesome!!! :-):-):-),0
I need to make a remark:  When I look at the timeplan : Metallica plays at 22.30 and the next Band on Orange Stage plays at 02.00  so I bet this CONCERT is going to be SPECIEL / Lars Ulrich is coming HOME.. !! Hope for 3 hours LIVE ...,0
I WAS ready for Metallica until they were put on the same time as Sigur Ros :(,0
I now it. I stay here in 1996 the full time. But now: Job  Family and other things prevent this....,0
I AM,0
http://goo.gl/maps/eKxP0 This is my route to Metallica. Will enter the festival as soon as possible.. and then WAIT @Orange Stage.. 11h FOR METALLICA!!!,0
finally some proper booking... not able to go this year anyway :-( ,0
Ready for every second of it! I have my personal favorites of course  but as long as I get to watch them I am more than happy,0
with the legend cliff burton R.I.P,0
Voina Art-group the mother group of Pussy Riot is going on a Roskilde rampage on this year's festival.  Check out some of their early work  which includes a penis on a bridge.  It's going to be awesome.,6
Dennis  we're not promoting knocking over a police car - which they are not going to do at the festival. They are going to make a demonstration there  which they can't do in their own country without getting arrested. You can say we're promoting the freedom of speech by inviting them and giving them a free space to speak their mind. We don't necessarily have to agree with what they say.,0
know them already from some great action in Russia  great to have them on Roskilde!,0
Violonce is good. As long as its on the authorities.,0
Metallica When???,0
Our current website is too old for such things. But we promise that it'll be possible om our new one.,0
Nice see you in 3 weeks  can't wait :),0
Thanks for all the parties Roskilde.,0
Dear RF -- looking forward to seeing you again. One issue which is absolutely nor clear: If I want to get into Silenc and Clean on Saturday  must I ALSO have a voucher for entrance booking? There is not enought information on this point!,0
Imagine this: Queen rocking orange stage,0
Queen without Freddie Mercury isnt Queen. Especially since they havent written ANY new material since Freddie died.,0
I miss Freddie Mercury too Klaus  but Queen without him  is still a Queen I would like to see on Orange stage assisted by Adam Lambert.,0
We're definitely considering it,0
Could be so sweet! Greatest metalteaser you have ever made! Thumbs up!,0
cool tak (y),0
We've got a bunch of great apps to guide you throug the festival. Download our official app  Crowdsearch to find your friends and Heaps to find your next party.   We've also made sure that your phone never runs out of juice. Charge your phone for free with 3 Danmark or book a portable charger with Volt!,2
And will the data network actually work at this year's festival for this to work?  ),0
I have got a Volt charger from the 2014 festival. I was told it would be possible to exchange it at future festivals. Is this the case?,0
Is there no Food app this year?,0
Faithless are reforming for one last tour  to celebrate their 20th anniversary. Would be amazing to get them headlining.,0
Another vote for booking the  Shampoobar  Young danish musicians from Christiania making music that touches You  !!! And a Great Story behind that shows what music is able To do .... That Orange-feeling is able make the World a little better ....,0

btw  see you in April in Sisimiut at Arctic Sounds - Music Festival will be playing with 2 bands,0
I actually wont be there :( I've taken a break from ITCOM since I'm living in New York for a few months...,0
ok  damn didn't knew that.,0
Need to wash your clothes  go grocery shopping or take a trip to the pharmacy?   This pretty special city called Roskilde Festival got it all.,2
Yes you are able to pay with credit card almost everywhere on the festival site :),0
Yes you have to bring your own facilities  but there will be a collective fire every night,0
Apple Pay too?,0
You can use a credit card or mobilepay - not apple pay,0
okay cool  thanks! See you tomorrow!! ??,0
what is collective fire??,0
It is a bond fire that everyone at the festival have acces to :),0
When do you release the exact dates for each band?,0
We don't have a fixed date for that yet  but we need to book and announce all acts first. We have  only  covered 54 of 169 so far.,0
Ok  so you don't know which day The Tallest Man on Earth is playing yet? :),0
The full band schedule is usually released only a few week before the start of the festival. If you want to know the day of a specific band  you can usually take an educated guess by looking at the bands own tour schedule.,0

Elizabeta Lace: The first time we meet was at a Get Your Gun concert last summer  and now that you are back in Denmark I'm really looking foreward to seeing you again. And what better place to meet again then in the company of these beautiful guys and their music. Valentines Day will never look or sound so good! And even though I don't really care about Valentines Day I could not think of a better way to spend it then with you and these guys!! <3,0
I hate valentines day  kiss my ass. and  this whole thing is bullshit  but please pick my friend Christel and Linards Kalninš (he's not on FB)  cause they are good people and wanted to get to this show.,0
Congratulations to Synne Larsen and Rasmus Wang Kaa - you are the lucky winners. Please check your inboxes for more info (it may hide somewhere in the 'other' folder).,0
Hey is it possible to order a- Get A Tent- in small for two people? And is it possible to order that as well as two tickets for a week pass at the same time or do you have to do that separate? :),0

I think Bob Dylan will be your biggest name :-),0
Does I get a Roskilde ticket if that is correct?  -),0
Bug. We'll look into it. Thanks (map must have changed),0
Is the time for the Kraftwerk show in the programme correct? I was just wondering  because Kraftwerk has put 23:00 on their event.,0
Just a thought  but I'm guessing Kraftwerk has enough gig experience by now to inform correctly about their concert.,0
Trust our schedule - it's bern cleared with all bands,0
Kraftwerk got it wrong on their event. Its 2200.,0
I agree - but so does Roskilde have. And the problem is Kraftwerk is saying 23:00 and Roskilde 22:00. My experience tells me that Roskilde often is right  but as it is a special show  which I guess does require some darkness 23:00 could be correct.,0
In this episode of  Coffin Camp goes to Roskilde  we learn whether or not VisitNorway will help Coffin Camp get on the boat to Roskilde 2013.   Check out the first four episodes here -> http://roskilde-festival.tv/channel/7965781/camp-life,4

I was there. Will be awesome if you can book Paul McCartney to Roskilde Festival this summer and we can sing with Macca in this song PLEASE :) ,0
heading to roskilde for the first time this summer with some friends  and was just wondering if so called  party tents  are available for purchase at the festival area? Noticed this picture showing loads of these white tents that look fairly similar to each other.,0
Hi Lars.  Great to hear. You'll have a great time. You can buy the white tents in Spejdersport's shops at the festival site.,0
I just know u will get them  http://m.spin.com/articles/built-to-spill-new-album-untethered-moon/?utm_source=spinfacebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=spinfacebook,0
On Saturday a whole lot of people will arrive at Roskilde Festival. To make everything as smooth as possible  we've gathered some information for you.   Read more about entrance booking  pre-booked access for Silent & Clean and much more.,26
Where is south entrance?,0
What's the case about Freddie Gibbs  is he still able to perform at Roskilde Festival?,0
Cathal O'Reilly read this so i don't have to plz & thank you x,0
How will you be handling people who show up before 1600 on friday?,0
So just to be clear  we cannot enter Silent & Clean on Saturday via P?,0
Katherine Landy Michaela Rynne - we need to plan which entrance we'll go to!,0
Entrance South isn't marked on the map linked on that page...,0
I heard som rumors that said N doesn't open until Sunday at 15.00 pm. Is this true?,0
Do you need entrance booking if you work as a volunteer?,0
What do you do if you have booked access to clean out loud?,0
What about arrival and entrance to Get a tent Central  on Tuesday? Last year it was a hell's circus to get in line in the area behind Orange...,0
Bedste Roskilde-Festival.  I wish to inform you that we need to have a grand showing of the last episode of Game of Thrones on Monday 10AM on a big screen. I am not sure I will be able to last a full week without seeing it. Since you are showing no games from the Uefa Euro 2016 I think this is in place.   Cheers Viktor,0
I'm trying to make a profile to the carsharing service  but I can't seem to get it to work. Tried two different browsers and both the facebook and manual profile creator. What do I do wrong?,0
If you check their tourplan and put 2 and 2 together  you'll see that it won't happen. Not this year at least.,0
Not if 2 and 2 makes a 5  ),0
Mathias: That's exactly the problem and a funny reference to their song of the same name :)  If Radiohead were to appear at Roskilde  they'd have to play five or six days in a row to follow their schedule. It isn't entirely impossible – TV on the Radio did it last year – but usually bands of Radiohead's size have to have days off at regular intervals in their schedule.,0
New acts this week and teaser also :) ?,0
And headliner? maybe rock or metal?,0
foo fighters :D,0
Foo Fighters would be fucking awesome!!!,0
THE CURE!,0
Alice Cooper will be in Finnland on June 28 and in Sweden on July 3. Will be awesome if you could book him to Roskilde also :),0

There's nothing called  Roskilde  (step 6) when I look under keyboards in settings. Do I need to get a app first?,0
Same problem here ??,0
There's an issue with the emoji keyboard in the app. We've fixed it an a new version will be released (hopefully) within the next 24 hours. Sorry about the inconvenience,0
Are you going to show the Game of Thrones season finale anywhere at the festival? I can't be the only one watching that show..,0
Not even The GoT-camp is allowed to broadcast it. More likely that Euro 2016 will be shown somewhere.,0
No,0
Want your design on 3 million Tuborg cans at Roskilde Festival? Deadline is 9 February.   Here are some of the submissions we have received so far.  http://www.tuborgrf15.dk,14
Jesper Frederiksen  we know that there's still time. We just consider this a way of showing how it can be done.,0
Are there any other clean camp areas  other than Clean Out Loud  where you can camp when you arrive to the festival?,0
Peter: Is it hard to get a spot there? Let 's say you arrive either saturday evening or wedensday morning,0
Well  before last year  you could always get a spot at J. Last year it fillede up pretty fast though. But as with every other area  there is usually room for one more (small) tent. Just ask people nicely to make room for you... :-),0
Cheers! feel free to check out our band. Devil (Norway) is a mix of Black Sabbath  NWOBHM and classic rock. Listen to our debut album here and like our Facebook page. ,0
Klumben og Raske Penge played last year. It surprises me that they didn't book Bikstok Røgsystem as well - but we get to see them at Northside instead :),0
Sukkerlyn is not making dancehall anymore. Klumben & Raske Penge was there last year. But yeah Hasse could play  he got an EP on the way  or just with his label could be an awsome party. I have no idea why they didn't book bikstok  seems obvious  but perhaps because they are playing so many danish festivals. Otherwise there is Kaka playing this year. No other reggae/dancehall  except one reggaeton artist...,0
When is the program for the movies and art projects going to be announced?,0
During next week - it'll also pop up in the final smartphone app that launches in a few weeks,0

I want to come one day backstage please!!!,0
This song reminds me of the queue at Roskilde 2010. They played it on and on till we all knew it by heart. Talk about promoting. The song has been amazing ever since and a reminder every time I hear it! I remember the sky was dark by clouds. Then  SUDDENLY the sun came out  the fences were torn down  MUSE - Starlight were playing insanly loud through the speakers and everyone ran like h*** into the camping areas! I stood back keeping luggage safe while my friends ran in to get a camp. I was looking at everyone running  the music  the sudden sunlight. I will never forget that moment! It was magical! Roskilde for life! ? This will be my 7 year there! Can't wait to see you all again!,0
Seriously  fix this!,0
Dear Roskilde! What are the rules on bringing in beverages to the festival site  not the camping  this year?,0
Searching for south entrance booking. Can offer en entrance booking for East in exchange.,0

Henry Rollins Spoken Word on both Friday and Sunday  on Odeon and Gloria stages  its a mistake right???,0

Kendrick Lamar is at Open'er Festival on the 2nd and headlining Wireless Festival on the 4th.....any chance of a detour to Denmark??,0
How our poster looks now. 54 out of 169 acts announced.,105
So question: How far is it running from one stage to another generally? Orange  Arena  Odeon and Pavilion are the ones I'm specifically insterested in :) ,0
Depends on how many people are in those areas. Orange to Odeon maybe 5 minutes  Orange to Arena 10 if you move fast.The festival grounds arent that big.,0
It's 9 minutes of music and 1 man waiting to see you at Roskilde Festival 2013  Momme Nommensen - performing his world exclusive show  Triangle of hell . Wednesday  July 3rd at 9 pm - City Centre East,1
??? I thought  he was going to play Pavillion Junior... Anyway it will still be amazing (y)!!,0
I cant' believe they didn't give him a stage! Really annoying and so unprofessional. It's like letting Rihanna play on Cosmopol!,0

But he can still sing and also living Legend :),0

Not a fan of one night stands  huh? ^^,0
I'm going to buy a couple of tickets next month. Do you think it's gonna be a mess? When do you think to be sold out?,0
think it will sell out faster this yeer.since the 1 day is allrdy sould out  normal it is sould out at juni,0
Hello.I think that it would be nice with a classic metal band.It doesnt always has to be extreme just because it´s metal.Nasum and Behemoth for example.I really would like to see some real meat and potatoe metal like Iced Earth or Gamma Ray or Motley Crue for example.Have a nice weekend!,0
Spot on! Go check Red Fang http://blastbeast.dk/?p=2414,0
Sounds good.Retro metal.A little hip.This years Graveyard.,0
saw them supporting Mastodon on their Hunter Tour.. great band - you can look forward!,0
I am still listening actually.I like it.They sound a little bit like Mastadon.Or should I say typical american  metal .Good though,0
sounds like a mix of old school heavy  sludge and doom with a nice touch of cheap old school production-sound!,0
Saxon!!! It doesnt get more classic than that.,0
Motley Crue are a totally outdated band in my opinion  but it would surely be fun to see them  but i could find very many bands who are same size as them and way better.,0
Is anyone wanting to buy a full festival ticket? Contact me if interested please ??,0
PM'd,0

Those Missoires you put up last year were gross  so instead of weather your butt under trees you had designated ares to weather your butt  and you could even be looked at! Last year i discovered She-Wee and it made my life so much easier! I peed with the boys in the urinal stalls  no ass out in the open  no standing in line to the WC and no mess! Girls Get yourself one  its a life saver!!!,0

Will there be any shop with camping gear (tents  mattresses etc) inside the festival? Or at least somewhere near?,0
There always are  but its quite expensive.,0
Yes  Spejdersport have had at least 2 shops (service senter east + west in the camping area) the last years. They have all the gear you need.,0
The rise of the Orange Stage 2016!  Orange Stage fun facts: The tent weighs 3.5 tonnes It's 1 946 m2 big The iron construction holding up the tent weighs 120 tonnes Roskilde Festival 1978 was the first year the iconic orange tent was used at the festival In 2001 a new canopy tent was taken into use - 30% bigger than the original  See you at Roskilde Festival 2016 for yet another round of amazing music experiences in front of this iconic tent!,142
has the duck been placed on the Orange Stage yet?,0
When did the duck first appear?,0
Tobias Hansen you ready? ??,0
You cant just buy tickets for Glastonbury. You have to send in a request to buy tickets and then they will draw who gets to buy them.,0
Even better... Or worse  ) Hehe..,0
Yeah but GB also has a population of 50 million or so.,0
But still! When I started attending Roskilde Festival  you had to be quick to get a ticket. These days it feels like most people buy their ticket on the way to the festival :p Hehe..,0
Hasn't the camp been expanded in later years?,0
The full band schedule is out. See who’s playing when and where at Roskilde Festival 2013.   Download schedule: http://ow.ly/lIIJL Buy your ticket: http://ow.ly/lDLxw,244

Will action bronson  joey bada$$  flatbush zombies & Danny Brown perform simultaneosly at cosmopol? And if so for how long?,0
One does not simply make someone to choose between Sigur Ros and Metallica.,0
If there is so much overlapping ... it must be a good line-up??? Right?,0
Roskilde Festival  is it just me or where is The National??,0
flume and james blake is the worst clash ever.,0
http://clashfinder.com/s/rf13/ for better schedule,0
Why does the schedule not say when a concert ends? How can I know?,0
It's a shame with Unknown Mortal Orchestra right at the same time as Metallica (almost). One of the upcoming bands I've seen forward to all year  but I can't miss Metallica either :(,0
OUCH  National or Anaal Nathrakh?? breaking my balls roskilde  breaking my balls,0
I have a problem with saturday's programme - how on earth can U guys justify placing metallica and sigur rós at the same time ...??? Big mistake  huge HUGE!!!!,0
Tell me about it :/,0
+ The Lumineers,0
Probably not. Last year they did the same  but the artists had individual shows.,0
Try and read that on your phone  nor very reader friendly,0
Yup really annoying. I want to see Joey Bada$$  but probably not going to happen now. I can't go check all the time if he is on,0
It isn't really a part of the  official  music programme  but a schedule will be in the printed programme you get along with your wristband – and this year WITH the music acts plotted in :-),0
They're playing the Skate stage in Street City  which is outside of the  official  music programme. See the printed programme  when you get it  for a schedule.,0
Thank you!,0
Yes  it's super annoying that they're making this whole  curated evening  stuff because it makes it very difficult to determine when you need to come round Cosmopol. I hope the bookers will make it clear when each artist is supposed to hit the stage so that I won't miss the other artists I want to see in that time.,0
Agreed - that's the one that stood out the most to me as well. I have plenty of other clashes  but Flume and James Blake at EXACTLY the same time was a real kick in the nuts to discover.,0
... or bad planning?,0
Could also be :) I am a positive thinker! :),0
Upcoming? They've been playing together for more than three years and have released two critically acclaimed albums.,0
Kvelertak or Unknown Mortal Orchestra??? Impossible to choose!!,0
You don't have balls.,0
Most concerts will be about an hour  while those on Orange stage will usually be about 1.5-2 hours. Robert Smith (The Cure) seemed to indicate last year that there is a strict 3 hour max for concerts on Orange stage - it was one epic performance with a two hour show and a one hour encore set. Amazing.,0
http://clashfinder.com/s/rf13/,0
No it is not,0
i must say your respond has illuminated my day. Not only do I fell so much at ease but will be  pro-metallica saturday  untill the festival begins - of course it was completely insane of me to dream of experiencing both -metallica and sigur rós - live. I do thank you for opening my eyes with your excellent comment  No it is not ,0
Oh yeah  of course  but they're still playing on Pavillion  and are not particularly playing huge gigs. Well  still doesn't change the fact that they're playing playing right next to metallica,0
They basically do this every year to avoid too many people in front of one stage  especially on Arena  but in this case probably also Orange stage. Last year Bruce Springsteen clashed with Bon Iver. That's just how it is.,0
No worries! I can choose for you. Sigur Rós. You're welcome! :D,0
and Neil Young/ My Bloody Valentine in 2008 and RHCP /Tiesto in 2007 and Iron Maiden/PJ Harvey in 2011.. it's a classic! Putting a headliner on the arena stage will be way to overcrowded if they didn't play at the same time as another major headliner on the orange stage,0
There you go https://www.billetlugen.dk/buy/tickets/?token=ZBixHRJxbOdrjaL6vxwcW6HxHzp1XBWbhPjNQlU9qHsVposmYa2h%2fkxgtIW5FliNFM7vaDUeJPkyYy99TwqzM5qsMOHvPDfa,0

Here's the final poster for Roskilde Festival 2013. How do you like it?  For hi-res: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/Roskilde%20Festival%20poster%202013.pdf,221
A new Metallica? Prepare to get sued.,0
sadly its pretty obvious that sigur ros will not play Orange  and will most likely clash with either metallica or chase & status :-(,0
Volbeat should be in second section instead of first...,0
Is the national really an orange cat?,0
It's a disgrace that there are no british indie rock bands.,0
BAHAHAHAH Metallica? worst fucking boring music in the world! fuck! Could i have some fucking good hardcore? nope.,0
Okay  Okay but - I'm still missing NIEL YOUNG WITH CRAZY HORSE !! When are you gonna tell it ?,0
glad I`m going to Northside instead......,0
If you put Volbeat as a headliner instead of Turbonegro  you're doing something wrong.,0
I like it so much that I have to get a ticket somehow! Any ideas Roskilde Festival? :) Metallica was the deal breaker for me..,0
I don't presume to know  but wouldn't Drenge fall under that category?,0
Yeah... you just don't fuck with Lars Ulrich.. he'll sue the shit out of you,0
You have a big american indie rock band  stop complaining. :),0
In sense of nobility  yes. But it could be questioned if their sound wouldn't be served better at Arena!,0
No - every year is there a danish headliner  and Volbeat is without any doubts one of DK's biggest bands,0
I'll take Suspekt over Volbeat any day.,0
yeah  lots and lots of great rock bands and reggae/dancehall  too.....at a fair Price :),0
But suspekt doesn't plays? It's klamfyr with band  and klamfyr isn't suspekt he is a single act  who only has made one album.,0
I'll bet Bai-D  Jooks  Rune Rask and loads of other Suspekt family members will be performing at KlamFyrs apperance. Maybe even LOC.,0
It was perfect at Arena last time,0
Still rocking like its 1960. Get back to to now Oliver.,0
seems that the word  indie  does not exist in tne Roskilde program this year - it is not in any band description.....so it was probably decided that indie is not hip anymore  eventhough some of the bands would have had this description attached in earlier programs :-),0
jonathan wilson is laid back as fuck :),0
:-) I'm thinking Metallica will play at 22:00 and Chase & Status will play at 01:00 at Orange of course  and Sigur Ros will play after dark and at Arena so either during Metallica or Chase & Status I'm afraid,0
or maybe Metallica will play at 21:00,0
He isn't coming. His daughter is getting married the same weekend as Roskilde.,0
or maybe will Metallica play at 21:30 like Iron Maiden did in 2011,0
I think we rest our case - Lasse doesn't know Volbeat and has probably been livin in a soil cave. (Y),0
Birger: Lol The National is indie and is a headliner....,0
What do you mean   any ideas ? You have two choices: Buy a ticket or work there.  ),0
They already been there too many times... Good to see something new and refreshing on the poster,0
Bowie doesnt tour at all. Might never tour again.,0
You bet. They are right here! https://www.billetlugen.dk/buy/tickets/?token=ZBixHRJxbOdrjaL6vxwcW6HxHzp1XBWbhPjNQlU9qHsVposmYa2h%2fkxgtIW5FliNFM7vaDUeJPkyYy99TwqzM5qsMOHvPDfa,0
sadly I was right :-(,0
Could simply be the fact that Volbeat are Danish and hence playing a home game. If Barcelona comes to Copenhagen to play against FC København  they will still have their name second on the poster  no matter how many Messi's they put in the team. Quite simple really. :),0
I know.. I'm just hoping for a miracle  ),0
Joey Bada$$  acton bronson  Flatbush zombies  Danny Brown  Kendrick Lamar. C´mon son  its the sickest hiphop lineup ever. Im only missing ab-soul  schoolboyq and the underachievers.,0
They shouldn't be on the poster at all...it's like giving a shitfaced hooligan a the mic and put him on stage. but besides that cool headlineres (minus Rihanna) but who cares  let the craziness begin :D,0
Hello massive! Check my ragga-jungle dj set  hope u enjoy it. >> Author: Jungle Jessus >> Name of the dj set:  Vinyl lover inna di ragga jungle selection  >> Styles: ragga-jungle  drum'n'bass  reggae  dancehall  mash-up  dub Big up Roskilde!,0
Lay-down cinema in Dream City :) Great idea,1
Will there be any H&M reboot camp this year? When will the ticket sale start?,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51hivIB0yc.  Just to let you know what we're doing,0
Jamiroquai to roskilde ! ,0
More Lol Catting!  ) ,0
On Thursday at 12:00 we’ll give you some answers to what follows below (<10 million likes).  Oh yeah  there’s a map too: http://roskil.de/map270115,22
Rage Against the Machine,0
Come join the fun at forum http://roskilde-festival.community/post68016.html#p68016 and take part in guessing what bands are in the teaser,0
 It's five o'clock somewhere ... Slash maybe? He will be touring in Europe with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators in late June! :),0
Some metal and rock acts ?,0
Well James Dean is there. In the movie rebel without a cause his bike gang was called black rebel motorcycle club. So I quess black rebel motorcycle club will be playing at roskilde again,0
There's a band coming from Minneapolis. I really  really  really fucking hope that it's The Replacements!,0
Marie Hanssen Filip Andrè Digre Marthe-Lise M. Kristensen Tonje Lubinski,0
James Dean could be Eagles from LA. The Pianos could be Billy Joel from New York :),0
Jawbone Spanked A Road Geek is an anagram of Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwabs,0
Neutral milk hotel? :D,0
The watch I guess is Slash  since he made a record with Slash's Snakepit called  It's Five O'Clock Somewhere .,0
 That stuff was really sour!  --Biggus Dirkus: http://da.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chicha,0
Jacob Rancid o specials,0
This is picture 5: http://www.accordionsandkeyboards.com/indexintro.html  It mentions The Who  who are from London.,0
The Hold Steady / Snow patrol?  - game of thrones picture???????,0
Sigur Rós or perhaps Oasis (or someone associated with Oasis)?,0
Christian Any ideas?,0
Kristian Flatabø Maria Natasja Askim Ingrid Viktoria Kviseth  Wæææææææ  torsdagen!!! Who from Bergen?,0
Kygo is coming! It says a guy from Bergen is coming :),0
1st 1979.  Nick Cave released his first album (with The Boys Next Door) in 1979. At the map Australia is marked.  Nick Cave is coming! Or maybe not. I hope.,0
MAJOR LAZER. Because that is some MAJOR LAZER coming out of Supermans' eyes. And they come from Kingston.,0
Kwamie Liv was just added to the Spotify Roskilde 2015 list,0
I think the statue is an animation of the Colossus of Rhodes  which has given name to Meshuggahs latets album  Koloss.,0
is it 12:00 danish time you'll give some answers or...?,0
Yes go here!,0
One can dream...,0
Hahahahaha im dying of laugh here. I would like to know how many times  RATM  has bees guessed here on facebook.,0
How about every time :-),0
You tell us :-P,0
Could also be Atmosphere or Brother Ali  o'course.,0
System Of A Down  Faith No More  Slash  The Prodigy will be awesome :),0
Billy Joel would be awesome  but I think those are accordions.,0
Yeah you might be right :/,0
Thank you  I was too lazy to type :D,0
:D,0
This links to the  Peruvian cumbia (musical genre). On the map there's one from Lima in Peru.,0
Metallica and slayer,0
That band does not exist anymore,0
My longshot:  Los Destellos - they're from Lima  Peru and are mentioned on the urbandictionary site.,0
Roots of Chicha is an album with  Chicha  (pop) music from Peru...,0
I agree. Also fits with LA on the map,0
RATM  Beck  The Libertines  Strokes  PJ Harvey  Tool  The Jesus and Mary Chain,0
They Might Be Giants  possibly?,0
Vaffö sku d va rancid,0
:O :O :O :O :O,0
Unfortunately  you are mixing it up with Marlon Brandos The Wild One.,0
Slash has more than 10 million likes though.,0
Ahh shit  you are right. I need to re-watch my movie collection again,0
Martin  i thought the forum was moving to reddit?,0
Niklas Birksted - no  that have never been there plan. I know Roskilde linked to some reddit tread at some point  but as we post on the old forum before it when down there plan all the time have been to move it to that url and all the old post have been moved with it,0
They tour Europe at that time..so i think you could be right (y),0
Also  BRMC's drummer is recovering from brain surgery. They won't be touring anytime soon.,0
Just Tool and my life is saved!!! And if all the toget acts suggested are playing as well  it ok  ),0
According to their official page  they will be touring in June,0
AC / DC are booked,0
But they will play at Roskilde on july 15 but not the festival.,0
Will be awesome if this will be The Who. They are iin Amsterdam on July 1. They played awesome show at Roskilde in 2007. I hope the will be back :),0
Or sigur ros+,0
:O!!!!!!!,0
Just seen Slash a few months ago  fantastic show,0
Confirm it.,0
nope and nope.,0
No Europe tour sadly...,0
But Slash featuring Myles and The Conspirators only has 27.684.,0
Jesus and Mary Chain are playing Northside. Beck are playing Skanderborg.,0
Are playing Northside.,0
Sorry  no - they are not available.,0
Where?,0
We've tried  trust us. It just wasn't possible,0
I saw him in Iceland. He was awesome :),0
Fits with the 5'o-clock picture!,0
Sadly they are from Chicago.. and that city is not marked on the map .,0
And Meshuggah could be the name from Sweden  ),0
The Who?,0
The Kinks?,0
The Dead Weather?,0
Príns Plante R.I.P The dream....,0
Yes  so it must be 6 am Miami time  right?,0
The 'statue' is an image of the Titan of Braavos taken from HBO's Game of Thrones :-),0

Rock or metal ?,0
Roskilde cat is SO ready to party!,4
Slightly more old-school...,0
Regina Spektor. I beg to god. ,0
Is there map out yet for this year's festival???,0
Hello - will entrance south be equivalent to entrance east and west this year  meaning that you can get your ticket exchanged to a wrist band? As far as I remember  this was not possible last year. Thx ,0
Got an email from Billetlugen today that got me confused.  It said: Entrance booking is optional and free. If you plan to arrive after Saturday  entrance booking is not necessary.  If you have not yet booked entrance you can do it here. It only costs 20 DKK (approx. 2 5 euro) in ticket fee to buy an entrance ticket..  How is that free?,0
It is a mistake in the email from Billetlugen. Off cause something can’t be free and cost 20 kr. at the same time. Entrance booking is free when you order it along with the Roskilde Festival ticket. But if you order it afterwards or want to change it to another entrance there will be a fee on 20 kr. Billetlugen change the information in the mail right away,0
Very nice,0
So people... how fast can we get a Roskilde-lolcat up here?!,1

Finding the meaning of life Roskilde Festival From a norwegian newspaper.,0
If the Tate Modern can do it  so can Roskilde. Africa Express's new release Terry Riley in C Mali sounds like a perfect choice for a sunny morning in Roskilde. ,0
New act announcements any time soon?,0

I'm working on making the 'clockman' (orange shape) into circuit board style too,0
Next week we'll be back with more. We still have quite a number of acts to announce before we hit 169,0
The snapchat teaser that appeared earlier today shows an image of the Titan of Braavos taken from HBO's Game of Thrones.  It was recently revealed that a mixtape for the upcoming season 5 was to be released featuring Anthrax and Killswitch Engage. I believe those two are the only confirmed bands for the mixtape  so it seems reasonable to assume one of those will be confirmed for #RF15 soon. Thoughts anyone?,0

We're missing parts of beast coast and TDE and im kinda dissapointed.. So wish The underachievers would have been there. And the rest of PRO era. And Ab-soul and schoolboyq..  Other than that  sickest line-up of any festival ive ever seen. So stoked!!,0

It's this simple: If you know you're gonna go  get a ticket now.,0
Has anyone else experienced problems when trying to sign up to buy tickets? In my case the screen always goes back to the same form. Also does not send me an email to reset password  even though it says it did!!!!!,0
How soon will we get new acts ?,0
I want a party like this: with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike ,0
I would love to see a camp like this at RF13,1
PWhy don't you make a new poster with all the acts?,0
Why*,0
The probably will  they have done so the other years. So cheer up sunshine!,0
It's on it's way.,0

Does wednesday mean time for announcements?,0
Not this time around.,0
Don't worry - the countdown is on its way. We know it means a lot to many people.,0
If you haven't yet check out  this metal band DESTRAGE. Please  get them to play  they rock!   Also  get Agent Fresco once again  PLEASE. :)))))))))),0
Please book Guðrið Hansdóttir to Roskilde Festival  they'd be perfect there!,0
Totally agree! Check them out in soundcloud ?? https://m.soundcloud.com/gudridhansdottir,0
Any idea when the caravan camp tickets might be released?,0
We don't have a specific date for it yet  but if you sign up for our newsletter  you will be notified.  http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2015,0
What do you think of this new Mew song?,7
A good song  but it doesn't blow me away. Still very much looking forward to the album though. And besides  with all things mew  it takes more than a single listen to fully experience it.,0
The radio edit does not do it justice. The new live version boosting 6 minutes  makes 156 sound boring IMO. And I bloody love 156. Just for comparison.,0
Not the full version but I love it! I'm singing this already  so happy they're back with a new album :D,0
Katinka!! :D <3,0
Natasja :D,0
It's absolutely gorgeous. It had potential when they played it as the last song at Roskilde 2012  but this version is just stellar!,0
amazing  Mew will never dissapoint me!,0
After listening to this track grow and change over the last 2+ years  it is delightful to hear the final studio version. It sounds really good now.,0
Sounds like the band Yes in the 80's,0
Mew is amazeballs  as always  but we crave some new acts now Roskilde  )!,0
So good,0
like it reat music  sounds good to me maybe its my computer sound tone  give 100%,0

Den Sorte Skole [officiel side] returns to Roskilde Festival. Below you can see what they pulled off the last time they visited. This year's show will be something entirely different.  We also announce KLAMFYR  Drenge  Kirstine Stubbe Teglbjaerg Official Bandpage and WOODLANDS.  These acts complete this year's Roskilde Festival lineup.,81
When do you release the cinema program?,0
Is it possible to get in to Copenhagen city or airport by bus/train after the last band has played? Like around 1 o'clock?,0
According to an article in the  Orange Press  last year  you where planning a major reorganisation of the festival site for this years festival.  But due to the new map  there have been no major changes. Are the plans abandoned  or just delayed?,0
WHEN ARE YOU ANNOUNCING MORE ARTISTS?????,1
Doesn't matter  we will come to the party no matter what !,0
Slient as in quiet does not exist at any festival.,0
Area J is the silent and clean camping area. It tends to fill up two days before the festival ground opens.,0

Isaac Delusion from France. Great album and even better live (at eurosonic). Would be perfect fit for pavalion,0

Congratssss As long it will get its orange colour back in june  you can paint all colours in the world 0),0
Such a good initiative  so glad my favourite festival is leading the way whilst providing so much fun ??. Why do more food stores in Denmark not do this?? I watch bags full of baked goods get binned by the bakeries every day - what a waste  so sad we can't be more caring.,0
Arena could be Green Stage again  at least in spirit :),0
Congrats! Now you 'just' need to get all participants to clean up after themselves..?? Leave no trace! BM style.,0
You should also book Rise Against! They  too  work for a better environment - and they are politically active  all vegetarians and straight-edge  you and them are basically made for each other!,0
We are in Det Runde Bord / Stop Spild Af Mad  very proud and sends thanks to all who helped make it possible. We have great hope for the future and the effort in 2015 is already in progress.,0
Peter on stage last night receiving the award  -),0
And this is how it looks like!,0
Great! Now  when will you announce more bands?!?!,0
If you really want to promote your  greenness   why not show a picture of vegetables instead of meat? After all  you're doing a lot to support vegetarism for environmental reasons. :),0
That's so great! If you booked The Kooks to play this year  that would be even more awesome??,0
Yea... cooking that food took a hellofatime.... and what did we get from it? :D ....PRIDE!! ...thats what,0

Don't want to worry about pitching a tent  transportation and all of the other things that doesn't involve partying?  Roskilde Festival has partnered up with Festicket to provide excellent value ticket accommodation and packages.,1
how long do you think it will take for the ticket at saturday to get ripped off? My dad's first home in about 6 hours,0
Laura Marling would be the finest late booking. Her new album is excellent.,0
happy sommar all festiwhalers. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IJ8pEMQWa8,0
Eye Emma Jedi!! Book them! They're incredible and from Norway http://www.facebook.com/eyeemmajedi?sk=app_178091127385,0
i come from the same place as the vocalist  they are great  good choice   ,0
I couldn't agree more. I haven't seen them live yet though  I know they're touring so hopefully they'll make it to Copenhagen soon. They would be fantastic at Roskilde.,0
Can you please respond to the Freddie Gibbs questions that have gone unanswered so far? Should we expect him? Will you find a replacement if not?,0
We don't have that many details atm. We'll get back to you when we do,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQLCne_CGg&feature=related  Could be epic..,0

I'm gutted I'm not going! :(,0
it might have saved the festival. Slipknot & Metallica just sounds better than Slipknot & Rihanna :),0

Metallica + Orange = match made in heaven (or is it hell  -) ),0
Hopefully they open the show with  Battery  as they did in 2003. :D,0
Excited to know when they'll be on.  Any news on when the running order will be released?,0
I'm not a native dane (skånska is pretty damn close) but there's something absolutely special about a person speaking danish to a crowd when in a world famous band.,0
Last time Metallica played Orange  they threatened to stop playing inleds we out elen out phones! Fucking assholes  Bruce Dickinson did the absolute opposite!,0
WHAT? Are they coming this summer?,0
Can't fucking waaaaaiiiiiiiitttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-D,0
oh i much remember once i celebrated that in 2009.,0
They've took part in the history of rock'n'roll and they should have stayed there. BUT there is still the fantastic band Queens Of The Stone Age to get earfucked by! Go festival!,0
Who cares  the Queens are comin' :P,0
I was there and also in 99 when Metallica played also :),0
Me too :),0
Lots of good rock bands but Metallica are the best :),0
I lost my voice in 2003 after the Metallica show hehe :),0
Still for one band.. its a damn expencive ticket price to pay..,0
Airbourne queens of stone age  slipknot and lost of more. The lineup is awesome :),0
http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/metallica/2003/festivalpladsen-roskilde-denmark-2bd6900a.html How about that  Battery and Puppets as the first two songs....I call rape. :D I was there too.,0
It's long way ......,0
But  Liam you are one of our 'regulars'. Why is it that we have to miss your company this year?,0
I can't afford it this year sadly  by the time I've bought the ticket and flight and spending money it's at least £500. I'll save up for next year. Book Arcade Fire for next year and I'll definitely be there  ),0
Hey! I’m searching for the travel buddies from Lithuania. Maybe someone is planning to go to Roskilde with a car and has an extra place?:)))),0
It goes really well with convincing Visit Norway that Roskilde Festival is cool and Coffin Camp is very excited. You can still give your like to the camp -> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151970397584832  This is episode 4 in the  Coffin Camp goes to Roskilde .

I would still rather see a man with a coffin shaped bas (@The Nekromantix) on arena stage  than a coffin shaped musik box some were on the camp site....,0
Yes... Of course! As soon as possible.,0
Send an e-mail to info@roskilde-festival.dk after 25 June. Then we can probably work something out...,0
Thank you :D,0

Do we get to hear the No-Drugs campaign jingle this year? We are many  to whom the jingle is special. This jingle remindes us that the next concert is about to begin  and therefore gets the chils every time we hear it. We miss it! ,0
Of course. Here's this year's video: http://roskilde-festival.tv/video/8185163/roskilde-festival-against-drugs And you can download it here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2012/Against_drugs/roskilde_finger_musik.mp3,0

A bit of a silly question I guess  but I still need opinions. I'll be going to Roskilde alone  Thursday/Friday/Saturday. Since I'll be flying straight to Norway for work afterwards I probs can't be bothered dragging/buying a tent. Is it a horrible idea to go alone and with nothing but a sleeping bag? ?? Cheers!,0
Can you turn a bunch of fresh ingredients into a tasty homemade meal? Now is your time to shine. Compete with other festival-goers in the first Masterchef FoodJam edition. Chef and former Masterchef winner  Timm Vladimir  will be the host and judge.  Buy your ticket here: http://roskil.de/masterchef  Ready – set – cook!,7
Hi Øyvind. In 2014 we chose to open a new stage Rising - located at camping East. The acts playing the stage were the same kind as previously - Scandinavian upcoming talent. Actually  that's how the whole upcoming programme started  with a stage at the campsite. And we'd like to get back to that. So  it means that the entire festival site remains closed until the final four days  and then it's all about live music from 7 stages.,0
Does anyone know any sweet names playing on the saturday?? cheers,0
So far nothing's really official. Here's what's somewhat reliable so far: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/lineupartists/roskilde_2012_play_dates/,0
Isn't it time to get D'Angelo to roskilde festival? :3,0
Now is the time! :),0
You get your spot in the order you arrive  so it's not possible to pick your own spot. If you have several vouchers  just hand them all in and the chances are great of getting spots next to each other.  Entrance booking in not necessary unless you want to be sure to be among the very first who will get a spot at area N.  Hopefully that makes sense.,0
Are we talking concert recordings? We're looking into a solution for that atm,0
I'm talking schedule. Simple schedules to look up which year I saw what on which stage. Like on the old homepage... That stretches WAY back.   Was Jeff Buckley on Red or Yellow stage? And Biohazard? and which years was it? I have the books/FEstival guides... But they are Sealed in the air of their era  so that they may be preserved forever! I can not open such entombed treasures of memories  to settle simple drinking bets.  also: you should always show such data as handy Easily accessible info.   ...Also: to brag!,0
Perhaps also the actual festival books in PDF? Some info on everyband that has ever played.   Fuck it.. .Create a huge  Encyclopedia Roskildium . When was which scenes introduced? Why did red and Yellow stage die that fast? Why aren't all stages simply called by color anymore?,0
Thank you so much for the 200 000 likes. This is for you.,115
If you like these boys so watch this video  they are double danish champion and got a 5th place at the World Championships in 2010. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueySYmCjhdc,0
can they open the orange stage please!!!,0
That would be awesome. Unfortunately they are competing for the Danish Championship during the festival.,0
good luck to em!,0

Raise awareness Roskilde! If you ever want to claim you did something for humanity  help make Kony famous and stop him. It's 30 minutes of your time  but a whole life time for the victims of Kony. WATCH !,1

Maybe we should look at the Sonisphere festival in UK and France and think what will be possible to get from that festival :O,0

What will you spend your extra second on?  Roskilde 2015 will be one second longer than 2014. Apparently  a positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2015. The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be:  2015 June 30  23h 59m 59s 2015 June 30  23h 59m 60s 2015 July 1  0h 0m 0s  Thanks to Robert for the info!  Photo: Martin Dan Olsen,13
I am very happy to let you all know that this festival will be at least one second longer.  A positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2015.

Do you dare to dream big? This year Roskilde Festival can become exactly what you want it to be  when camping area P (East) is turned into Dream City. Whether you want to build something or show off your performance skills is entirely up to you. http://dc.roskilde-festival.dk/,17
What would you build if you lived in Dream City?,0
the leaning tower of piza in scale 1/1 built with empty beercans,0
Will this mean less camping space in p? A lot of people rely on this when the other areas fill up,0
DREAM CITY  WHO SAID  DIESEL HUMAN CARWASH !!!?,0
Liam Cross The capacity of the P area will be the same as last year. Dream City will only be a part of P and this part will of course be a bit different than usually.,0
Sounds very interesting  can't wait to find out more :-),0
I would build a  bed tower  with room for about 10 people. Then each day the tower would have new inhabitans  so perople would meet new people..  B-),0
great guy. you should invite him!,0

Haha  BY THE WAY.  Oh  I forgot to mention... . Nice! :),0
Dreams do come true now and then! Thanx  Roskilde!,0
HIT THE LIGHTS .... you have officially redeemed this years crappy lineup :-D,0

@Michael Cyberduck Wall: They're not at the Bråvalla-programme?,0
Fredrik Andersson.   The unforgiven   )?,0
Roskilde festival: I am sitting with tears of joy in my eyes! My colleges just Said: You can not work today after that announcement! You already had an awesome Line-up  but this... I am speachless!!! In 2003 when my love to you  RF  first started you also gave us Metallica. Truely deeply I love You!,0
Holy shit. Too nice I already have the ticket  ),0
Ok so that helped me make my mind up then- defiantly not going to Roskilde this year then.,0
When you say 12th album  do you mean  Death Magnetic  or are they already presenting the one they were working on? (I don't count  Lulu   which is no album for me...),0
By the way: Did the ticketsales go not as good as the years before?  -) Anyhow this comes too late for me  unfortunately. Holiday's planned otherwise.,0
Ill make sure and let all 7 fans know~,0
FFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!,0
Looks like volunteer for me this year too...!,0
 Just when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber  you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!!!! ,0
Hoooooly shiit! What a fucking name drop!,0
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEAAAAARRRHHH \m/,0
Eline Thon :D :D :D,0

Okay  so now my head just spontaneously exploded... This is beautiful!,0
see above: world's most casual announcement,0
Well. Fuck you guys. I had just come to clean terms with me NOT being at Roskilde Festival this year. Now I have to re-evaluate that. Damn it!,0
OH MY GOD  OH MY GOD  OH MY GOOOOOOD!!!!,0
Metallica say that they will be in Denmark the weekend of July 4-7! Which day will the gig be ????????,0
what day ???,0
One of the coolest examples of U.S. - Danish collaboration we can think of!,0
Finally some good music on Roskilde this year  Yay,0
I last went to roskilde 10 years ago. Metallica were playing then. 10 years later we are both back :),0
By the way... fuck you! now i have to come even though the money isn't there,0
any other surprises coming up?,0
This is so freaking amazing. This year I celebrate my 15 years anniversary at Roskilde  so Metallica also played at my first year in 1999. My camp has its 10 years anniversary this year. Also my wife is pregnant (she is still going though)  so next year we may not be able to go with the baby and all.  I knew that I might have to break my 15 years attendance streak next year so I was kind of sad that there were no giga-names for me this year but this really makes up for it. I will pretend that you did it for me so my love for you will grow ever greater if at all possible.  Thank you so much. See you in a month!  \m/ (>.<) \m/,0
Haha  I'm not complaining!,0
Hvilken dag? :D,0
Good job! You have redeemed yourselves from the shitty program :),0
Nese Baglama!!!!!!!! MY LIFE IS COMPLETE!,0
Fuck you Esben,0

So wish I could be there n ode to Has on this. Have a hoot guys :-),0
Nice ! :D,0
I don´t understand metallica  and was wondering during workout you played <3,0
This makes up for the rather poor headlining. Go to Roskilde since 1991±this year too  but the program should be more exciting  with bigger acts.,0
I'M SO HAPPY :') <3,0
this years Roskilde will be awsome vobeat slipknot and now metalica Fuck yir,0
Please book Megadeth as well then,0
searching  seek and destroy...their fans??? *,0
They should get a new drummer  then we're talkin..,0
So awesome!,0
have you heard about hellfest in clisson next to Nantes it takes place in our home town!,0
sorry guys   in which day will metallica play?,0
What day?! :D,0
OH. MY. GOD. finally!!! :D,0
Is this an ad for Ray-Ban?,0
I watched them last time they played at the festival and it was awsome!! Sadly I miss it this time!,0
Yes!!! :-D,0
Oh My FUCKING GOD!!!!!,0
MEGA OPTUR!!!!  :D,0

Looks like 3 bands  one for each Font. The first font is called superglue  the next is Zubilo Black and the last on i dont know. Any bands use those fonts for their albumcovers or somethig? The first one looks a bit like something Tool would use.,0
When will you do the announcement  Roskilde Festival?,0

Army of the pharaohs?,0

 Malcolm McCormick  I ask: Marry me! -Dominique Clark,0
They guy who said Mac Miller might not be all wrong. if you go to this page  where his tour dates are  you can see that a show in Copenhagen has been confirmed. Nothing about place or time though,0
Thank you very måch,0
its not rage against the machine haha,0
Alex  his real name  Malcolm McCormick  which seems to be produced by the first anagram.,0
Great! One down :-) guess I was wrong then..,0
This one is very hard teaser,0
@Anders Ah.. I found the name  but I didn't recognize it. Seems the anagrams are the real names of artist aliases. Two down  one to go!,0

I read that Freddie Gibbs had to cancell his european tour as a part of his bail agrement. If this is true will he be replaced by another hip-hop act? :),0
Do you have any idea when the program will be released? My mom would love to go for 1 day  but dont know which day.,0
You mean the full 'who's playing when' line-up? Expectedly in May.,0
We'll let you know later in the season.,0
What exactly are you having trouble playing? It works perfectly fine here.,0
Please give it a try on a different computer. We've tried on several and experience no problems.,0
Tickets are selling at a steady rate. We expect a sold-out Roskilde Festival 2015.  A good way to secure your ticket now is by using our Flexpay option - pay a little at a time.  http://roskil.de/rf15flexpay,57
Roskilde Festival are tickets selling fast ?,0
How many tickets have you sold so far? I mean - previous years you've sold out within days after a similar statement.,0
Laura Skyum-JensenEmilie Skyum-JensenKristina Hyre-JensenMelissa Stoklund HaldStine S. SchiøttClara Suhr,0
Hey Roskilde festival.. What is the price for children tickets? All I can find is info how to buy it in the entrance not how much it cost :(,0
Atli  they are. It's the best ticket sale in many years. It doesn't mean that we're sold-out anytime soon - but we definitely expect to be long before the festival.,0
Douglas we'll make sure that all Flexpay'ers can book all entrances come 1 May. But you have to be quick on the trigger.,0
Så in i helvete!,0
We're not sold-out anytime soon - but we definitely expect to be long before the festival.,0
Understandable with that line-up! Thanks for the quick reply. I'll buy my tickets in April if there are any left =),0
I got my ticket to Roskilde for this christmas :),0
Here's to hoping :-)  But you should consider our Flexpay solution if you're short on money atm,0
I am considering! Thanks again!,0
Yeah manner :D,0
We don't deal in tricks. We're not sold-out anytime soon - but we definitely expect to be long before the festival.,0
Let's get on it!,0
Did you buy them? Sweet!,0
1 for you me and Hannah. Sorry Buttel :(,0
Sofia  we'll get back to you on this. No matter what  children's tickets (10-14 years) are only sold at the entrance  and they are available regardless if we're sold out or not.,0
Currently  we don't have a fixed price on this particular ticket. But as mentioned earlier  it cannot sell out - so give us a little more time :-),0
Ok cool. Would be good to know if it differs alot from full ticketprice. Got a 13-year old to become and it lays in our interest to know what kind of budget needed..,0
I seem to remeber that a child ticket ia about half the price of an adult one.,0

My tenth year too this year!,0
You should have a tattoo tent on the festival. I need to celebrate my 16 festivals =),0
27th for me :-D,0
I've been at Roskilde Festival 25 times and made my tattoo 9 years ago. Sadly I can't afford it this year. ??,0
Desperately searching for a caravan ticket? anybody? ... please message me  when you have a ticket that you don't need. Thanks! And if you have a ticket but do not have a caravan? Maybe we can share the experience (and the ticket!). Would be so great !!! There is an official waiting list  but looks as if it is not working,0

Hey guys. Recently me and my friend has been trying to buy a ticket through this facebook page. Both got attempted hustled by two allegedly finnish people that wanted us to transfer through a money service called SKRILL wich is a transfer service that allows for more or less anonymus transfer of money over country borders. If someone in here tries to do the same  please be suspicious and ask them to send you a picture of them holding their identification or just completely avoid SKRILL because its more or less only used for scams. They use stolen identification cards and create fake facebook profiles so keep your heads up. Toodelz,0
Is IT allowed with 2 party tent? And How many People must You be?,0
New acts start of the year 2015 ?,0
Sometime in 2015  yes. We can't be more specific than that atm,0
Let s get Alice Cooper to Roskilde. He will be in Finnland some days before the festival. And also Scorpions  Slash  The Who  Paul McCartney and System Of A Down :),0
The who!,0
The Who will be awesome to have back to Roskilde. They played awesome show at Roskilde in 2007. The Who are in Amsterdam on July 1. Hoping The Who will be back at the festival :),0
Cooper and Who yes please,0
Crystal Castles don't sound too unlikely. They're in the neighbourhood (EU) around when Roskilde takes place. Justice  Blur and The Stone Roses are all playing other major Danish festivals and thus aren't coming. None of the Danish festivals will ever share headliners  because it would pose a risk to their ticket sales.   But let's see. There are at least three or four headliners to go aswell as a LOT of subheadliners.,0
I can read both  but if you want others to contribute to the debate  English is usually best :-),0
Fine! I hope Crystal Castles turn up  maybe then they will play Not In Love together with Robert Smith. That would be cool. As for the other bands  I don't really care if they come or not  but my friends are considering another festival in Sweden because of those bands. And I really  reeeeeeeaaaaaaallllly want to go to Roskilde. Right now  I feel Roskilde is falling behind with releasing bands fast enough if you compare with other big festivals in Scandinavia. And damn it  I really want to go!!!!!!!111,0
This is because Roskilde is always slower on the uptake. April 19th though  a bunch of names should correct that. They'll release 80-100 names or something like that in one go that day. So far we know only 20% of the programme (40 of about 200 names).,0
And by then  the tickets are sold out :(,0
That is very unlikely! Last year they were sold out like a week before the festival or something.,0
Okey  good to know! I'm freaking excited,0
More Hip-hop  more electronic music - less crappy softcore rock ,0
The Kooks & Edward Sharpe and the magnetic zeros!! plzplz,0
Architects  Your Demise  Icon & Anchor  Oh Sleeper... kom nuu : (,0
Architects (y),0
they will be in amsterdam on the 6th i think they should pay roskilde a visit!,0
Kompliceret men absolut muligt:  Soundgarden is still possible on the 6th as far as I can see:  - Chris Cornell is not playing with either Soundgarden or solo.  - Matt Cameron is not playing with Pearl Jam. He plays in Berlin on the 5th and he is going to Stockholm on the 7th.  - Soundgarden is playing on London on the 13th  and have not played since June 10th. They surely need a warm-up gig!   Roskilde July 6th!!!  Hilsen Mads og Rasmus D,0
I hope we will get Scorpions to Roskilde Festival 2015 :) ,1
Dream City looks very dreamy all dressed in white.  Thanks for the photo  Helle Søndergaard.,21
Merry Christmas to you all!,2
Alice Cooper to play Tuska Open Air Metal Festival 2015 / Helsinki on June 28. Please get him to play Roskilde next year :),0
Make sure to try this app if you plan to take your Android with you to Roskilde  )  ,0
Consider applying it for labs.roskilde-festival.dk if you haven't already,0
Thanks for the the suggestion. I already did this :-) Since the deadline have been postponed from the 1. June to nearly the start of the festival I needed some alternative way to create awareness of the existence of the app.,0
Haha  Great! We'll of course share it one of these days.,0
Yess. So many great bands on Pavillion and Apollo. And we are open all the 4 first days. Can´t wait....,0
Hej Roskilde!  Just wanted to hear: One of my friends told me that Red Hot Chili Peppers have cancelled their gig.. Can you confirm that?,0
Tell your friend that he is full of shit :),0
They're playing!,0
is the entrance tickets for south sold out? i have a full festival ticket tho,0
They are.,0
will it be possible to buy ice cubes at the camping area? :),0

Faul  system of a down  Motorhead  pink floyd (waters etc)   gesaffelstein  chinese man  coka nostra eller the bloody beetroots til.RF15 :) Juleønske :),0
And You don't have to - Anders  -) Any perspective is valid in my opinion. I have followed Your former recommendations (thank You for them) - But I am sorry to say - this festivalprogramme represents an all time low to me - and I have 25+ in my belt - and no - I'm not one of those old farts who wish for an endless repeat of concerts with my old heros - on the contrary - I thrive in new discoverys at Roskilde each Year...... It should be quiet obvious who the repulsive  skrigeskinke  is  -),0
I don't think it's pretty obvious. There are lots of american artists on the programme. Rihanna isn't one of them  if she's the one you mean – and  going by the rumoured wage she gets off of the Roskilde-gig  she's much less expensive than  say  Bruce Springsteen or Prince.  I've been through the programme – all ~190 acts so far and found about 25% must-sees and loads of maybe's.   A couple of recommendations based on the two highlights you  despite everything  found:   If you like Jake Bugg  check out My Bubba  Jonathan Wilson  Schultz & Forever and John Grant.   If you like Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats  the obvious next steps would be The Sword  Talbot and Baby In Vain.,0
The sword is fuckin amazing and so is Jonathan Wilson,0
Thanks for the recommandations Anders - I've been there - but perhaps a second try is worth it - and thank You - I am aware that she was born in Barbados - she is still a disastrous booking.,0
Here's the band schedule for the first four days of Roskilde Festival 2013.  The schedule for the final four days will follow next week  expectedly.,25
Roskilde Festival will these concerts (or some of them) be broadcasted or uploaded?,0
Are there more bands to be announced..??,0
Gr8 but shouldn't you announce the last 12 ish acts then.. Today is fine  -),0
Anders these concerts won't be broadcasted live  but hopefully a lot of them will be available at Orange TV (http://roskl.de/) after the festival.,0
Not for these stages. But we do have a few more.,0
Will some of them be released today?,0
You got 5 names to day  so don´t expect 12 more,0
When will they be released?,0
You have to wait a bit longer...,0
any headliners?,0
Mirco .... more bands to be announced!!!!,0
Dave  we are Europe  we don`t spell it out one time!  -) I told you  be cool  there`s running more!  -) When not  you`ve got Vienna! I´m very drunk tonight  Training  haha! I´m so happy to have you guys!,0

It've become a tradition among me and my 3 good friends to go to Roskilde Festival. We've visited the festival the past couple years  and its as big a blast every year.  The economy  however  is a bit rough for the two gentlemen on the picture  and i therefor wish and hope that they get the chance to win two roskilde tickets  so we can enjoy an ongoing tradition.  One of us  Michael  was very lucky this year  as he won 3S' music competition and already got his ticket  and i will be able to afford my own. Merry Christmas!! #CampKlapvogn  Mathias Ulrich  Pætter Wollesen,0

I think I made  those balloon dogs for you..  Been making those since 2006. Great!,0
Actually we made them our selves! Taught my friend to make them after a bottle of tequila.  ) But let's make some at Roskilde '15! I'm ready.,0

Charlie Francis I may need to kiss your face when I next see you...,0
Out of ideas for the last Christmas presents? Here's one and you can print it yourself.  Available here: http://roskil.de/giftcard,7
We'll make it available on Youtube later on.,0
Stephen  whatever we have permission to put up of concert recordings  we'll put up. RS isn't among them  unfortunately.,0
Hi people. . Can i ask something?   Why is nobody using  Ticketmasters resale services that the festival recommended?  Is it a problem site or do they take out a large fee or something. ?   I live in  South Sweden and may have a full festival ticket + Get-a-tent Central  ticket  to sell (preferably as a combo)  For the price we bought them ..   Can anybody  recommend  ticketmaster?,0
Yes  using ticketmaster is the safest trade for seller and buyer  so please do so.  http://www.billetnet-media.dk/tools/rf_market/index-en.php?camefrom=rf16_web,0
I do belive people selling on their own  is selling to a much different price. That might be why.,0
https://youtu.be/9V1JICvCxk8,0
... oh my god! Desperately searching for a caravan ticket? anybody? ... please message me  when you have a ticket that you don't need. Thanks! And if you have a ticket but do not have a caravan? Maybe we can share the experience (and the ticket!). Would be so great !!! There is an official waiting list  but looks as if it is not working :-(,0
SEARCHING Hey there  so we really need your help! Our car just broke and the only car we can lend is a caravan. so we are desperately searching for A PLACE ON THE CARAVAN CAMPSITE. anybody who can help us out here? <3,0
They put on a great show last time. Don't think they've come out with anything too interesting since to warrant a revisit though.,0
doesn't matter..,0
Help Coffin Camp from Norway get to Roskilde  by convincing VisitNorway that Roskilde is cool  so they can put pressure on the captain of the DFDS  Roskilde cruise   so they can bring The Coffin with them  so they can party with you all on Roskilde Festival...and probably live happily ever after.  Confused? Click the flick :-)  This is episode 3 in the  Coffin Camp goes to Roskilde . Check out the first two episodes here -> http://roskilde-festival.tv/channel/7965781/camp-life,41
The coffin has been traveling by DFDS the other years  but nice gimmick.,0
What good is a soundsystem  when the music you play on it sucks balls?,0
Peter: What? No. As you can clearly see in the video  they have a new  No Coffin  policy on the cruise. The video have in no way been manipulated. You can't manipulate video in that way,0
if the Music we play  would come out of the soundsystem and starts sucking balls  i Think our coffin will become really populare within the male crowd :-D,0
Are AC/DC at Roskilde this year? Only joking guys  I'm sure you've answered that about a million times now and probably lost the will to live in the process. Any big dance acts at 2015? Would love The Prodigy  Sigma  Knife Party  Daft Punk  Basement Jaxx  The Chemical Brothers or Chase & Status.,0
Is ACDC really one of the biggest acts in The lineup next year?! ?? acdc.com says they'll be visiting Roskilde??,0
Jump up in the Fucking Air and Scream! 2013!!!!!  ,0
Another one bites the dust  with great competition from Bråvalla Festival on the same weekend. (Swedish Siesta-festival was supposed to be held this coming weekend  but also claimed bankrupcy) Bandlist on Peace&Love included:  Depeche Mode  Pet Shop Boys  First Aid Kit  F.O.O.L  Hakan Hellstrom  Iggy & The Stooges  Queens Of The Stone Age  Paramore  The Sounds  Gogol Bordello and The Hives.,0
Does Roskilde intended to provide special offers for those with a Peace and Love Festival ticket?,0
From what I read Sweden Rock Festival offered ticketholders for Siesta-festival (only an hours drive between the two) entrance to either friday or saturday next weekend.  So some type of  old friends  goodwill could be possible.,0
Possibly the current billetlugen.dk outtage could be related to this. I'm not aware of any big concerts going on sale today that sometimes brings billetlugen.dk to it's knees.,0
It's mean. It's heavy. It's Roskilde 2012. ,36
Hah  Behemoth :D,0
\m/,0
do more annoncements this way!,0
WOW! I must say  that I am proud  that Poland has suh great metal band as Behemoth :),0
\m/,0
Cool!Horns up!,0
We're festivals with two different profiles. So if you dig Sweden Rock's programme  you should go there (no offense).,0
So there's no hope? Been at Roskilde 11 times  and dont think the profile is that kind of different. Exept that Roskilde is much bigger and has music in all kinds of categories :) ,0
Well  we think it is :-),0
Well  I dont think Iron Maiden  Metallica  Guns'n roses  Black sabbath  Tool  slipknot or Faith no more f. ex. is so far away from the sweedish line up. And all of these have I seen at Roskilde the past years...,0
None taken. All though I don't think you quite get me. All I meant was that I haven't seen bands like the ones coming to SWR  coming to RF this year. (Such as Motley Crue  whom i requested the past many years  ) ). I don't want you to be SWR  but I think that a lot of the critique you got last year was for not having acts like these. But the announcements isn't over yet  so I'm keeping my hopes yup,0
up*,0
I'd love to see King Diamond and Mötley Crüe at Roskilde. Especially the King  since he is the most influential danish musician ever! unfortunately SRF has an exclusive deal with him  but how about Motley Crue???,0
And I have no idea why i kept on calling SRF  SWR . But I guess that most people figured it out.,0
With the festival ending on a Saturday this (read: 2015) year more of the paying visitors will stay for the final night. Sunday used to mean leaving the festival early to get home for Monday at work for lots of people. These people will now stay for the last day  meaning less space on the grounds if RF allowed people in for free. 2014 was quite crowded during the Stevie Wonder concert. And like they're saying  sure there will be new  pensionists  every year  but remember  they were in their 20s when the festival started  so the chance that they have visited the festival already is high if that is in their interest.,0
This year's most raved-about hip-hop group Run The Jewels is ready for Roskilde Festival 2015.,74
Frederik Becker uhm... Fuck how lucky Can i be!!,0
If I mean that Run The Jewels is totally uinteresting I have my right to say so. Do everything on this side have to be positive  Lasse?,0
Zacharias Spliid its oooon,0
More danish dancehall,0
Be Joeled ...........................................................................................,0
Is this really the best you can do ?,0
I know. Been there several times before,0
And I am totally okay with that.,0
Try give the acts a go? Have an open mind a couple artists you haven't heard of before? I'm quite happy with the lineup so far  and of course it's not everything that I want to see. Keep a positive mind about it  and then after all it might be good anyway. :-D,0
RUN THE JEWELS,0
Not bad,0
Offcourse :) i just dont see the point of your comment... come up with constructive suggestions instead of disrespecting the fans and the bookers :),0
Nice one Roskilde Festival  please could you get J.Cole there too :),0
OH MY,0
shiiiieeeet  MUSE  PHARRELL  !RUN THE JEWELS! awesome,0
Run The Jewels gat gy egt nice vinne :p,0
No way,0
Uh-oh  someone's not pleased! What's your favourites  then?,0
Kim  AC/DC wants to play their own show on their own stage  so it just wasn't meant to be.  Mew is one of the biggest bands in Denmark  so yes  they deserve a top spot.,0
Kenneth Thomsen  what's important is that they're both on the poster  right?,0
More hardrock and metal please... Godsmack  Slash  Five Finger Death Punch  Black Viel Brides  Chainfist  Tyr  Papa Roach  In Flames  Nightwish... Most of them seem to tour next summer.. Please get them before CopenHell.. or even Tinderbox...,0
What Mikkel said plus mötley crüe  Mötorhead and Tom Keifer,0
Foo figthers :D,0
go to download?,0
Roskilde Festival. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy is also one of the biggest bands in Denmark.. They also deserve a top spot  don't they?,0
What about D:A:D?? They havent played on Roskilde for about 10 years!!!,0
Notice the text at the bottom of the poster: 32 out of 169 acts announced.  Patience  young man :-),0
We are looking for international coordinators in Bergen  Göteborg  Hamburg  Malmö/Lund and Oslo.  More info: http://roskil.de/rf15internationalcoordinators,5
How about Leer or Oldenburg (Northern Germany)?!?! :-D (y) I'll be your guy! At your service. :-P,0
Lukas  notice this paragraph:  If you are a perfect candidate for International Coordinator  but not living in these five cities  do send us an application anyway. ,0
Sorry  I was too excited!  -),0
For the love of God  get swedish Ghost to attend the festival! Their new album is amazing!,0
Slash is playing festivals. He will be awesome headliner for Roskilde :),0
Fucking greatest festival in Europe! Hard out Rock N Roll. Cheers from Amsterdam.,0

Kære Roskilde Festival. Hvis man nu har bestilt billet til Silent & Clean og planlægger at gå ind 16:05 når alle de andre er løbet ind  skal man så stadig have en indgangsbillet til Øst/Vest/Syd? I har skrevet lidt modstridende på jeres hjemmeside:   You will have pre-access to the area from Saturday 25 June at 16:00 until 24:00 midnight. After Saturday 24:00 (midnight) the area will be open for everyone. Please note: This pre-booking only gives access to Silent & Clean. To gain access at 16:00 you will also need entrance booking  Note that if you are planning to arrive after Saturday 25 June at 16:00 it is not necessary to book entrance. It is not allowed to enter the Camping Site before Saturday 25 June at 16:00.,0
Hello Roskilde festival. Im wondering about this AC/DC act that have been  announced on AD/DC home tour page. Do they play at Orange after the festival? OR is this actully a christmas gift to all Roskilde lovers all over the world? Rock on from Norway,0
AC/DC wanted to play their own show on their own stage. So it really has nothing to do with us. The show just takes place at the same place as the festival.,0
Well thats like having Jimi Hendrix after woodstock was finished. Sounds really strange for a Roskilde veteran. Til lykke,0
You HAVE to get Frank Ocean now that King Krule can't come!!!! He is so good  and so many want him to come!!!,0
Will there be a bridge from M  to the rest of the camping area again this year? ,0

I just want to share this pic.  I've found the ultimate festival passtime.,0
Hey has AwolNation played at Roskilce yet? I would like to see them there.,0
We regret to inform that King Krule won’t be able to play Roskilde Festival 2013 anyway. Due to unforeseen scheduling difficulties  King Krule has to cancel most of his festival shows this summer  including Roskilde.,21
That.....SUCKS! :(,0

Replace them with Six60! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JC_Z3WBkeo,0

Nope  they're not touring this year or with this album at all.,0
Thursday the 4th of July  probably. Schedule usually hits the internet mid June.,0
Oh yes  concerts on all days.,0
Will you be showing any of the Euros round of 16 matches  please?,0
anyone got west entrance i could buy or swap for south ??,0
It's the northernmost part of camping West.,0
He's only available Friday  and he's in France and Belgium all the other around or during Roskilde. Pretty unlikely that it'll happen.,0
No  no  just like my comment.,0
The full band schedule usually isn't ready until mid June. Rihanna most likely plays Friday or Saturday. She's in Poland Sunday and Thursday she is probably taking a break after playing in Germany the two days before.,0
Earlier this week Coffin Camp asked for you help in deciding what to build for their camp with this year: A cross-shaped speaker tower  a mausoleum facade or a tombstone-shaped camp sign. Your votes have been counted - this is the result.  Also  check out episode 1 if you missed it: http://roskl.de/video/8185018/coffin-camp-episode-1-the-coffin,4

Markus -> for some reason Roskilde seems to ignore Aarhus,0
see you in Lund!,0
As long as you don't ask the state councils to expropriate the spaces in the four cities...  -),0
But in your article you don't deny asking Roskilde Kommune to expropiate the private area to your benefit...?,0
You're overestimating our power. We can't tell Roskilde Kommune to do anything.,0
I said  ask   not tell!,0
Rene - Sooooo in your openion people/business shouldn't be allowed to ask questions  in my opention that sounds a bit like that bananarepublic other people are calling Roskilde Kommune.... Just sayin',0

I am just wondering about haw many additional artist will be announced during the next mounth??? could you give me an estimate???   I started wondering about this because I was checking out Nekromantix tour plane  and saw that they are starting a smaller European tour on the 6th of July. What could be more perfect  if this former Danish based band  who hasn't played in DK for several years  if they started there European tour on Roskilde..... The Nekromatix last played at Roskilde in 1997 on Yellow stage as fare as I am informed....  on the 6th Nekromantix are playing together with Batmobile  why don't just bring them along to  )  I was considering writhing a similar post regarding The Toy Dolls who is playing in Germany on the 29th of June  and who hasn't played in DK sinse 2004. But I do think there is a better chance for you to surprise me with Nekromantix (all though still a small chance).  All though the music has change a lot during the last couple of years  I am still looking forward to my 15th consecutive Roskilde... see you there ,0

Help the legendary Coffin Camp get to Roskilde Festival 2013!  Check out the first video and influence how they decorate their camp by commenting below. Should they build: 1: a cross-shaped speaker tower 2: a mausoleum facade for their party tent 3: a tombstone-shaped camp sign,11
The mausoleum facade!,0
1. Very doomy-gloomy..and something to get wed under. :),0
this is way too silly  reminds me of the norwegian  russe -celebration,0
1  clearly. Party till death do us part.,0
Blastbeast metal camp is doing an inverted cross stereo  ),0
2.   Inverted cross tower speaker is already being done by Blast Beast Camp in Dream City.  I really like the old Coffin Camp sign and don't think you should change that.  So a mausoleum party tent complete with fake cobwebs and  everything would be a brilliant addition,0
let's do the mausoleum :),0
I would love to see #2 =D,0
How about like... Building a Barad-dûr model.. Man that would be fucking sick like... fuck,0
a cross-shaped speaker tower :),0
Keep voting! We'll count up the votes tomorrow and pass on the result to Coffin Camp.,0
a cross-shaped speaker tower,0
Haha damn  this is just brillant! Love it! I have to go for #2 the mausoleum. Hope I get the chance to come by with Cold beers and chill :),0

As of yet  he isn't convicted of anything  so labeling him a criminal is very much a stretch. You're innocent until proven guilty of anything. This is a very basic premise in the western system of democracy and justice.,0

Snowden is a hero who sacrificed pretty much everything but his life and personal freedom in order to bring the truth to the people. Do you think he actually wants to live in isolation in Russia? I can assure you he doesn't  but that's his only option other than throwing himself at the  mercy  of the American courts. Look to Chelsea Manning for how that goes.,0
Jocke Wallinder There hasn't been a court case  so technically  no  he isn't a convicted traitor or criminal.,0

Which right would you fight for?  Every year we choose a theme that we believe is important and deserves support and attention.  In 2016-2018 we will be focusing on different aspects of equality with a particular focus on political equality in 2016. We believe equality between people is essential for a socially sustainable and democratic society.  We call this EQUALITY: STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS.

Hello  I am a first time Rosklide planner. I have no idea how this festival works. When will you announce who plays at what time and on what day? Also is it possible to attend the festival and not camp? ,0
The schedule usually hits the internet around mid June.   You can attend the festival almost whichever way you like. The partout-tickets are for all nine days  from the evening of Saturday  June 29th to the night after Sunday July 7th.   You can also buy one-day tickets to each of the last four days separately. All tickets give you access to the camping area in the same timeframe as the tickets are valid. One-day tickets grant you access to the camping site from 05.00 to 05.00 the following morning.  The only thing you CAN'T do is gain access to the camping site and warmup without buying a ticket for the festival too.,0
What Anders says:-) We're looking forward to see you this summer Prarthna!,0
Back in April we asked the festival camps to orange up the world by each putting up 100 posters in creative ways. The results were absolutely awesome!

WHHHAAAAAAAAT THE FUUUUUCK!!! That is the mist crazy thing ever. Hell yeah RF13,0
A legend!,0
if he's going I'm going,0
Jeff Bridges sings..? :D,0
Rubber Duck keeps on truckin'!,0
Yup. This is it for today.,0
Will there be more big announcements?,0
They didn't promise  two big acts . They promised  1-2 names in the absolute international top class . Actually  you could say that that promise is already fulfilled with Chase & Status and Kris Kristofferson. Both are huge names by almost any parameter. But you never know.,0
You're thinking of Jeff Healey  who sadly died five years ago.,0
Because some other festival in Scandinavia snagged him and has exclusivity clauses in his contract with them. He cannot play elsewhere in Scandinavia this summer.,0
No  he's thinking about Sam Elliot http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000385/ who as far as I know is not a musician,0
Dylan is huge  springsteen is huge and Willy nelson is huge. Kris on the other hand is not. I am sorry Anders that I can not agree with you on the quality of this years festival. I am just bitterly dissapointed that The festival I have been to 6 times has lowerd its standards down to a Average small town concert weekend.,0
Sam Elliott can be whatever he wants!,0
Well Ragnar  I can't fault you for not knowing what's big and not big in country  but the festival's standards is high as ever. Let's see if it doesn't get sold out. I think so.,0
Who gives a fuck what´s big in Country. I want big names in Rock roll. Not some banged up old Country fart and Rihanna!!! I hope its gonna sell out. Dont wanna be alone watching this crap.,0
Nobody forces you to see them,0
Hey are Roskilde releasing more bands for RF13?  Just to make it clear  im not complaining  just wondering..,0
They released 3 electronic names last week. If the post below holds true  we get one more name today – Kris Kristofferson. There's 10-11 left then  since Rikke Øxner said that there were about 15 to go in the days just after poster release.,0
And the two Arena closing names so there should be 9 bands left.,0
Anders: No  actually the two Arena closers were already on the poster on the release day  just like the Orange opener and closers Vinnie Who and Kraftwerk.,0
Hey. Wanting to buy a full week pas. Willing to oay 2500 -. Pm me,0
Still seeking a full festival ticket! Would be cool if someone could help me out! :),0
Selling a full festival ticket  lemme know if you need one! :D,0
Also - I can book South so it's included in the ticket :),0
Want beer waiting for you at the festival?  Now is your chance  beer-loving festival friends! Get your Tuborg Package now. In 2016 it'll include 24 cold Tuborg  4 Somersby Red Rhubarb and 4 Brewmasters Collection. And the best part - it's only 195 DKK (incl. VAT and Refund) and you pick it up at the festival.,67

There is still hope for AC/DC next year :) Brian  on 2015 tour : “Next year I would hope… I think we’re planning a tour now  but but obviously we don’t know  the men who do this or sitting in offices planning… And next year I think for the very first time  I think  please don’t hold me to this  but I think we wanna start in Europe  so we’re gonna enjoy the summer  do some festivals  stadiums. Because usually we start in America. And I’ve heard that we might start in Europe. But once again  don’t listen to me  I’m in the band  we’re the last ones to know!” Frá ,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whQQpwwvSh4 AC/DC have to come next year to Roskilde PLEASE :),0
They've also announced today some live shows for next year.  3 European festivals have been confirmed.  Fingers crossed for Roskilde,0

Can see that U2 have some free slots in the 2015 tour. Just,0
Nine Inch Nails just putted out a new album... GO FUCKING NINE INCH NAILS THAT WOULD BE THE SHIT,0
Hi Roskilde! Im a contester of the poster contest and when trying to send my pictures this weekend i got an email back saying that the mail cant be delivired. I really wish to join the competion and sending my pictures of the setup. Do you have another email that i can use? ,0
Et dejligt minde til samling It's like coming home to 130.000 friends -Morgenfest i C <3,0
...our craziest camp photos? (2011),0
Im sure we ALL need Foo Figthers to complete this years festival !!! Come on !!! ,0
http://www.festivalrykten.se/gaslight-anthem-till-hultsfred/ Please book Gaslight Anthem to Roskilde also :),0
No  i was hoping for them to play Roskilde and maybe with Bruce Springsteen but no :(,0
Any word around booking of re-united grunge-bands for Roskilde yet? Pearl Jam playing in Oslo 9 July  and Chris Cornell playing 5 July  makes the booking of a Roskilde ticket pretty hard if they don't announce any grunge-names soon... ?,0
Perl Jam is a bad idea...,0
Of course  but some of the bands touring Europe this summer are: Soundgarden  Chris Cornell  Tenacious D  Them Crooked Vultures  Deftones  Mudhoney  - and hopefully Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chains. So far Chris Cornell and Pearl Jam are announced at gigs in Norway that crashes with Roskilde - but if some of the other bands are booked for Roskilde - the Orange feeling is still something to consider... hard choice though.,0
Wouldn't call Tenacious D grunge though.,0
Nope  but cool nontheless  ),0
When will the next band update be there? I counted on it on Wednesday  but nothing....  ,0
Okay  thank you  I missed that.,0
Yes  so more music Saturday  Sunday - and even more next week.,0
http://www.facebook.com/Deceptic?sk=app_178091127385 please check it out  u gonna love it  ) ,0
Please stop reposting the same link.,0
Not yet. But we'll keep you posted.,0
Will we get more acts later ? sometimes before Christmas ?,0
Let's see about that,0
Page not found :/ ,0
same here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/music/2015/tombs,0
Otherwise  congrats on one of the best websites I've seen! It's awesome in every way! Love that I can check out all the artist with a single click  listen and read  then add to favorites! I hope you have an  export schedule  function when the schedule is ready  and that it'll have a nice simple look (for printing).,0
I would also love an extra filter for the music section:  not in favorites . As you add more and more artist to the line up  it's nice to be able to only see the artists you haven't already added to favorites and see if you find more gems :),0
It should work again now.  Btw  all your favourites are also in the app if you log in there  so no need to print :-),0
A bit of Roskilde camping atmosphere. Share your craziest camp-photos!,36
Will you announce new bands this or next week? :-) Thanks for Chase And Status! It gets better and better <3,0
get Son of Sun and the Bombsquad to Roskilde Festival please live band with creazy mc will rock hop the party for sure,0
When will the last names be added to the line up? ,0
their drummer plays with Pearl Jam during Roskilde,0
Just bought my ticket for my 16th festival since 92.Hoping for a good musicalmix as usual with some good metal acts to make us oldtimers happy.,0
In exactly 8 weeks Kraftwerk will perform their massive 3D show at Orange Stage.   Any suggestions how to hand out and recollect +50.000 3D glasses?   Gather your camp and bring your craziest suggestion for this challenge to win 1 ticket for your camp.   And remember that we only have a limited number of one-day tickets for Thursday-Sunday: http://bit.ly/RoQiWE,25
Have an airship drop them - making it rain with 3D glasses over Roskilde. Recollection? Exchange a pair of glasses for beer at exit.,0
Where can you post your suggestions?,0
Everyone coming through the gates on sunday gets a pair. If you accidentally break them  just double back to the gates to get a new pair.,0
People would take advantages of the refund  and take more than one pair of glasses,0
Hand out the glasses as we get the armband  and don t ask for them back...Problem solved:-),0
Do the same as in the movie theaters - Hand them out by the entrance to the festival area  2-3 hours prior to the Kraftwerk Live Concert  same place you check for wristbands. You could also have handouts near the intrance to the  pit  and in the area close to the Orange Stage so people could easily get a hold of a piar of 3D glasses. Have bins or containers by the Orange Stage and near the exits for people to drop them in when they leave after the concert. Its actually very simple. I have worked in a cinema so i know this method is the easiest way for the viewers and the publishers - if you need advice  feel free to contact me.,0
Hand over glasses upon entrence  give a 2dkr refund on return.,0
Serious Answer? Hand them out with beers along with handouts at the Orange Stage entrances. For every glass returned hand out a ticket to a competition for free tickets for next years Festival. And put at least 100x2 tickets in the competition.  Ohh and if the Glasses carries the name  Kraftwerk  you wont see any of them again :),0
You just beat me to it. Would have suggested the exact same thing,0
Mee too!,0
Would you bring back a pair of plastic glasses for a 2dkr refund? or would you just throw them on ground instead of standing in line for the refund?,0
what would be the problem exactly?,0
aaaand the gypsies would collect them like the beercups etc  no problem to be found here. next.,0
90% of em won't survive until the concert then loool :D,0
Very true Thomas  but for us that hopefully do keep hold of them  we will see a different show:-),0
Here.,0
or use duct tape! :),0
They do in fact have 'Kraftwerk' printed along the temples :-)  http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/7775667166_a375ac9304_z.jpg,0
Haha  no reason to bother with getting those back. The real problem is avoiding handing out more than one pair pr person.,0
Hmm maybe if they give a discount on the next beer purchase they might be able to get some back.. on the other hand.. that would ensure that most people would try to leech as many as possible :),0
There is some issues with this  but mostly that can be solved somehow. You need to give them all day Sunday  since people might get at the festivalsite early and see all the concerts before coming to Kraftwerk  so you would not get yours if you came before the 2-3 hours window which you suggest. Also another issue is that volunteers can get trough a lot of different entrances than normal guests  the question here is how about that  should you then just take one entrance then you can get on there if you entered a other place,0
then you could also have volunteers hand them out close to the stage  especially those people who are standing in line to get a good spot in  the pit . This way they would not have to go get the glasses  but the glasses would be given to them where and when they need them.,0
Lol - not gonna happen...,0
Or you can just hand them out at the entrances,0
Dear Theis Mørkøv Holm. Our Orange Stage people found your suggestion to be the best  and they loved the fun=effectiveness thing you have going on. Therefore you are the winner of one Roskilde Festival ticket! They are currently not sure whether they will use the idea or not  but it's definitely a good inspiration! Please email your name  adress and phone number to competition@roskilde-festival.dk so we can send you the ticket.,0
Can you please book Rammstein? They have available dates on the same weekend as Roskilde is. Thank you! http://www.rammstein.de/tour/en/,0
It would be awesome! But I am afraid that they wont,0
I heard in an interview that they have had contact with the band. Unfortunately  orange stage is too small for their stage show.,0
That sux! :(,0
Roskilde got also 2 big metal names this year Slipknot and Volbeat,0
Time to upgrade the orange stage  ),0
The Black Keys announcement to break?,0
Van Halen! Hell yeah! Very very very well made album they just have made! Let's get some real rock'n roll to Roskilde :D,0
So true! Amen,0
Yes! And go check out Unisonic if you guys don't know them.. Two legends of metal together again!,0
Muse (for a change...). So innovate.,0
Excuse my utter disinterest in Muse  having seen them XX times  ) If that's the big rock headliner  that's fucking disappointing to me because that makes it almost certain no other big  headlining rock band will be added.,0
I'm glad you're here to tell me what I'm thinking  Martin.  They confirmed Deafheaven - one of my wishes came true. I'll take that  but it's still a weak-as-fuck announcement for me.  It just had to be Myrkur as well to make sure the entire population of Brooklyn will be in attendance.,0
I guess people form Brooklyn doesn't deserve to go then. I'll go have fun with my Deafheaven and Pallbearer  and you can go mope in the corner.,0
While Muse is a great band and a band that I'm going to listen to and give my nod of approval and utter sentences like  This is some well composed rock  and  My God are they are good band   if Blink-182 was announced it would be like taking the entire rock music listeners aged 24-35 and toss them into a time machine  shake them around and give them 2 hours of beeing teenagers again.,0
Your selective vision must have missed the part where I said I wished for Deafheaven. Add Pallbearer too - their set at Hellfest '13 was immense  one of the best at the festival that year.  That is of course a big IF for now. I'll wait and see what the full line-up bodes before throwing 2000 DKK at the festival.,0
Havent seen them since 2006 when they opened up for Depeche Mode in Sweden so im really looking forward to it.,0
And all the more power to you for that. I was equally excited the first few times I saw them live.,0
Alright  this is all of course subjective. But implying that Myrkur is just a booking for  brooklyn  or whatever is kind of dumb and pointless.,0
Jonathan  take it with a grain of salt  ) I just found the high concentration of Brooklyn based black metal bands on the bill already now a bit amusing  ),0
Hah. Yeah  no hatred here :) I guess I was just a bit tired of people complaining every single time there is something they don't like. But I see what you are saying..,0
I'll be hugging the goddamn fence at Deafheaven if I do decide to show up at the festival  rest assured :P,0
It'll be the first time seeing them  so i'm pretty exited. But Pallbearer is gonna be the shit! :),0
i don't see the problem here being the booking of >muse<. the issue is that it will be the... fifth time? for muse to play roskilde within a pretty limited timespan.,0
Muse  St. Vincent  The Tallest Man On Earth  The War On Drugs and 16 more to play #RF15. Press play to see them all.  30 out of 169 acts announced so far.

In your new app under Camping you write that the campingarea opens at 1800 on sunday the 29th. and closes on monday 7th at 1400. That can't be correct  can it?,0

Hi Atli. It isn't...,0
Holy crap that's a long time. I really hope it's atleast perfect by then  and not the buggy version WP users have had last year...,0
Thorvald  When 95% of the userbase is on two platforms (iOS + Android)  those platforms are higher priority.,0
Danm :( but some big rock act ? AC/DC will maybe play Glastonbury  they should play Roskilde also. Then i hope it is Foo Fighters.,0
Well  all they're saying is that they won't be announced tomorrow. Here's hoping! :),0
We can always hope for AC/DC announced later :),0
The Libertines!! The Jesus And The Mary Chain ??,0
Because pretty much nobody buys windows phones.,0
Probably not...a good way to get everyone to download the app though,0
It's an act.,0
i got it!,0
Oookay then:),0
Bjørn  not necessarily. It could also have something to do with tomorrow. Time will tell...,0
Pawel  we will get there. But it won't be ready before late spring 2015.,0
I do :-),0
See answer below,0
They announced earlier this year that the whole festival will be moved next year  so yes  it's correct :) It's only by one day  though. I guess you can find an update about it further down here on the page.,0
I know that they have moved the festival. And that is why it cannot be correct that the festival will open sunday (as last year) and close monday (as last year).,0
Do you still experience this?,0
nope its good now :),0
Sorry  that was old info. In 2015 we’re moving Roskilde Festival one day backwards. Our four days of music start Wednesday 1 July  and the concerts continue until Saturday 4 July.  The full festival period remains the same. So  moving back the festival dates also means that we open the campsite one day earlier  more specifically Saturday 27 June. This still gives you one week of Roskilde Festival – as usual.,0
no,0
We've also got announcements Saturday and Sunday,0
But when will we get th next headliner :) ?,0
That's a totally different question  Atli  and hasn't nothing to do with this topic.,0
bring george clinton and parliament funkadelic to roskilde!,0
Please stop spamming the wall with the same requests. This is your final warning.,0
hey man im just encouraging you to book the best and most influential funk band in the history of music,0
Fight the power!,0
LOOKING FOWArd for you signing fresh rockbands like foster the people and wolfgang  can we b expecting rock bands of that calibre? ,0
Foster the People are touring USA during Roskilde. Wolf Gang are in USA at least late June supporting Coldplay on their tour  so unless they go on and announce a slew of european dates start July  I guess we won't see them either.,0
at least i am hoping that roskilde signs rock bands like them,0
Why should George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic come to Roskilde? Because they're awesome and fucking legendary!!!!!,0
We released our new EP (Darkwave  Synthpop  Gothicrock)  you can listen to it on soundcloud : http://soundcloud.com/dusktodawn/sets/existence  and it is available for purchase on bandcamp : http://dusktodawn.bandcamp.com  Greetings !,0
Get Lamb of God to play this year. Would be wicked sick!,0
Do you have an idea for the ultimate festival app? Now is the time to create amazing user experiences that 130.000 festival-goers will enjoy this summer. Check out Roskilde LABS and let’s get started!,19
Black Keys please!!!! :D,0
Against Me in Europe in July!!! ,0
This is the sketch for the new Apollo Zone.   We can't wait to see what it will look like with all you guys in front of the stage...,37
I am foreigner and I want to join this festival ....How can I join@@!!!,0
Really enjoying your Roskilde Festival 2015 Spotify playlist. So much good music already booked!  Great job guys! :-) (y)  http://open.spotify.com/user/roskildefestival14/playlist/7x2aIZcaikMJqUhPKyESVn,0

CHASE AND FUCKING STATUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS <3 Så fik i sgu solgt den billet :D,0
Tenacious D and Metallica  please. =) ,0
2 people like this  Roskilde! Now make it happen! :),0
Makes sense since they're already in Scandinavia  playing Way Out West in Sweden. Luckily I have a mate who recently moved to Göteborg making this decision much easier: Way Out West all the way.,0
already in Scandinavia (that weekend),0
The Gaslight Anthem are playing in Sweden weekend before Roskilde. Please book them to Roskilde :),0
Book them please! ,0
Refused has announced that they will do some reunion gigs in 2015! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have them come to Roskilde Festival!!! Please?  ,0
I got this mail from you. SEE IF YOUR ROSKILDE WISH COMES TRUE ON THURSDAY Dear Roskilde fan  On Thursday at 10:00 CET we'll reveal 20 new acts. You're receiving this heads up because you entered our music request campaign back in September. Maybe a wish will come true. Either way  we'll be all over the genre map so there should be something for everyone.  My wishes was  AC/DC  Foo Fighters and Slash. I really hope theses acts will play Roskilde :),0
Yes  you did. We sent it too everybody who participated in our music wish campaign. So  consider it a general notice that a bigger announcement is coming up,0
Some big names on thursday then :) ?,0
I said on the first teaser:      More music announcements next week! We’ve put  10 clues inside this ‘street view’ map of Roskilde 2014. Maybe you can  figure it out. We even made a discussion thread for you: http://roskil.de/reddit (total amount of Facebook likes: 858 931). So with a combined 858000 likes for the bands this week you should expect any of your wishes this week.,0
Volbeat to Roskilde Festival 2015,0
We’re releasing 20 new acts on Thursday at 10:00.  We’ve added even more clues here: http://roskil.de/streetview  Discuss: http://roskil.de/reddit,18
Better de some good ones now.  Tinderbox Got calvin Harris hope you also Will have him that Would be Nice,0
It's probably gonna be Muse and Foo Fighters  they seem to be everywhere next year.  Fingers crossed for The Prodigy  -),0
System of a down maske . naeste ar  der har tour,0
Some qualified guesses so far  partially also based on comments on Reddit:  The War on Drugs: The red eye in Game City. Could also be Fu Manchu ('Evil Eye'). Someone also suggested Franz Ferdinand  but they have too many likes to fit in here.  Goat: The mask at Pavilion  where they also played last time around.  St. Vincent: The video with the guitar at Relax City. Looks like a Harmony  Bobkat  which she has prominently used a lot in her career.  Buraka Som Sistema: The 'I love kuduro' sign at Apollo coupled with the country-code Angola/Portugal.  Four Tet: The mosquito spray in Dream City as well as the MoMA sign in the Oval.  Deafheaven: The Soundcloud snippet in the Oval. Sounds very much like George Clarke...,0
Refused will do reunion gigs in 2015! Please have them play at Roskilde! Please please please!  http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/11/refused-announce-reunion-shows-for-2015/,0
no idea,0
:D,0
hoping so  muse are playing bråvalla in sweden tho so they might go to tinderbox or northside since it's FKP scorpio... but hope not,0
Also at Rock Werchter too. I guess it depends on what days,0
Well  Deafheaven it ain't  apparently. RF has shot that theory down...,0
Didn't you see them in 2012 when they were here?,0
Ofcourse I did. Dennis stood in my hands. In my 11 years of going to Roskilde  that was one of my best experiences.. and I've been on stage twice :),0
(Dennis stepped out in the crowd and sang  Rather be dead   so he literately stood in my hands.) ,0
Petteri: Yeah  well  that was kinda unexpected  since Anders from RF shot it down on Blast Beast's Facebook page...  -)  EDIT: We were wrong about the clue  which referred to Pallbearer.  Pure luck that we guessed Deafheaven then.,0
Chase and Status will take on the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival 2013. Their electronic party combines the best parts of drum’n’bass  dubstep  pop and rock in a magnificent collision.  We also add Kenton Slash Demon and Om Unit to the line-up.,108
Holy Moly that's a good booking..! Hopefully it won't be as crowded as the Cosmopol tent in 2011...!  -),0
Thumbs up!!,0
Orange?? Don't like that idea  now that the setup for the Apolle stage sounds so amazing :/ BUT GREAT BOOKING and I guess you have to put some acts on Orange.. Nice with Kenton Slash Demon as well!,0
pisse hamrende godt! :D,0
Nice with chase and status  but seriously  get Muse.,0
Sweet! How many acts are there left tba?,0
They've just been there.. How uninspired.. #bookingamateurs #amateurbookings,0
This is gonna be the sickest party ever.,0
CHASE AND STATUUUUUUUUUUUS!!!!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Uwu5GR3eI,0
dam wish i was going 2011 went off,0
Roskilde Festival HVILKEN DAG??? :D  yyyyeah! 2011 was crazy fedt!,0
Dont know what to say realy..this is getting worse and worse,0
Chase & status delivered a spectatular show last time - but why not something new in the last minutes...,0
Åååhhh naaii! Im not there.... :(,0
As always. Dissapointing,0
Thx you so much! I did'nt saw them in 2011 due to Iron Maiden which was a fantastic concert  but i'm looking forward to their concert this time! It's gonna go fucking down!,0
Nice! Both Om U and C&S are going to be awesome I'm sure :),0
hell yeah cahse and status,0
Boards of Canada would be sweet ,0
They don't really play live anymore  but it would be crazy cool  if they all of a sudden did again.,0
Most likely Friday or Saturday. No-one really knows though.,0
Yeah I'll think that to :-),0
Also try here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/topics/meeting_point/,0
Tomorrow we will add more music to the 2013 line-up. Here's a little teaser for one of the three bands coming your way. Happy guessing! For hi-res: http://bit.ly/13f8mFY,34
Wow those are sucky guesses xD,0
Hopefully some more headliners..! :-) Very exciting!,0
NIN are not anywhere near Europe until mid-August  so I'm quite sure it's NOT them (unfortunately),0
2nd: Bad Religion? Hope not,0
Alabama Shakes  please!!!! Or  The Shouting Matches,0
Guns'n'roses? They have an album recorded and coming out sometime soon (the next 10 years) and they got banned in China with their Chinese Democracy. I don't know what the first one could be,0
This teaser is only related to ONE of tomorrow's bands. So no clues for the two other bands here...,0
More than 5 albums  album(s) banned in Asia/China  album to be announced?  U2's album 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' is banned in Burma/Myanmar.,0
I would guess the teaser refers to a band with 2 albums out and a third coming soon. No idea who thoughi,0
whats not banned in china lol,0
Here's a little teaser for ONE of the three bands coming your way,0
Psy!! :D hahaha,0
Their first album has more than 5 of something? Their second album is banned in china? Their third album is to be announced?  wut,0
what the heck does unwrinkled malls and to nail supposed to mean,0
1st: The Shortest Straw. 2nd: Master of Puppets??. 3rd: The Black Album,0
Notice the writing that says  UNWRINKLED MALLS TO NAIL . What is that supposed to mean?,0
@Anders Nørgaard Larsen don't you dare get my hopes up!,0
1. Random 2. Access 3. Memories Makes no sense  but please!,0
Metallica! The shortest straw  master of puppets  the black album. Has to be! :'),0
RHCP would be awesome,0
The Strato Ensemble? 1st album is named Drawn Straws,0
D.A.D? Thats what I see.,0
Hm.. unlikely  but Velvet Revolver? Five members  two records out  one possibly pending. Banned in Japan during the tour following the 2nd album. Probably with Corey Taylor in front now. Likely when Slipknot's around too... well  maybe.,0
Please not Muse again!,0
It can't be DAFT PUNK???????,0
All three clues are on album covers  they're probably referring to album titles.  They say 1st  2nd  and 3rd  so it's probably their first three albums.  The third says TBA  a common acronym for  to be announced.  Their third album is probably coming out this year.  As for the clues  I have no idea. The only way I can think of is to go through this list of 2013 TBA releases and look for bands that have 3 albums..   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_albums_released_and_scheduled_for_release_in_2013#Unscheduled_and_TBA,0
Tba= the black album?,0
I need Danzig. He's just around the corner those days. And with rollins at the festival every Day.  I would be incredible to see both Of Them onstage playing misfits songs. I really need This.  With my need to attend the Roskilde festival. I will miss the Danzig gigs in both sweden And Norway.,0
tba. to be announced,0
The figures are Japanese (http://www.ivoryandart.com/servlet/the-template/benzaiten/Page) the other picture can be found here: http://sweet211.ru/more/275485/ but got no idea how that is supposed to help.   But if they are using the statues correct it should have something to do with Japan and not China.,0
Muse made a Facebook Update on December 21. Saying:  Denmark - we havent forgotten you! We have a tour announcement comming in the new year. Stay tunned.... Thank you for your patience  Could Well be..,0
my guess is 30 seconds to mars  blur or green day?,0
Mumford and Sons!,0
1st = bigger than nine... Pearl Jam's first album is named ten.  2nd? Don't know.  3rd = New album upcoming...   But I guess they never return  sadly but understood.,0
Did you get The Black Angels for me after all?,0
Headline  subline or further down the poster? More clues!,0
My bloody valentine?,0
Chase & Status 1. Album:  More than a Lot 2. Album:  No more Idols 3. Album:  ... (up for release in 2013),0
Someone on the RF forum just posted this guess:  Chase & Status  1. album is  More than a lot  2. album is  No more idols  3. album is planned for 2013,0
What time?,0
Arch Enemy plays EU festivals this summer. *Hint hint*,0
Please book AC/DC to Roskilde Festival 2015 :),0
Metallica should return to Roskilde very soon. The show in 2013 @ Roskilde was the best Metallica concert ever :),0
Hi we are 3 guys from Sweden who wishes to buy 3 tickets! please contact me in PM. Kind regards Jacob,0

Hi fellow Roskilde fans!  We are four students of media science who are currently working on an exam project in connection with which we are creating an app based on Roskilde Festival and The Orange Feeling.   We would be very thankful if you'd help us by answering a few questions regarding the use of smartphones during a festival such as Roskilde.  We look forward to partying with you all in exactly 53 days!  Best   Sara Haugaard  Mona Mattle  Veronika Lykke Benzon and Merete Bjerrum,1
If you are making an actual  physical  app  why not submit it to the labs.roskilde-festival.dk project? We dare you  -),0
When is the map ready? :) I need one with the entrances for 2013  would help with the booking.. ,0
The Apollo Stage is taking over part of the gravel pit and we are creating a brand new zone of electronic music.,30
Its sounds really cool and interesting! We could use a couple of more energetic electronic acts though imho. Chase & Status would be killer on this stage (even though they haven't made much lately)!,0
Mathias  feel free to post more pics if you have any nice Apollo-shots from 2012.,0
You might be in luck...,0
Get your hands on MØ's outfit from her legendary #RF14 show and 2 tickets for the sold out Roskilde Festival 2016.   International superstar MØ has quite the special relationship with Roskilde Festival. In 2013 she played her first Roskilde Festival show at the Pavilion stage - one of the most visited shows at the upcoming stage ever. MØ played a breathtaking show at the Arena stage at Roskilde Festival 2014. Now you have the chance to get your hands on the outfit she wore at that memorable show.   On 20 June the UN celebrate International Refugee Day to shine a light on the rights of refugees. In collaboration with Dansk Flygtningehjælp and Lauritz.com  MØ and Roskilde Festival are doing an online auction for the outfit that MØ wore at Roskilde Festival 2014 as well as 2 tickets for Roskilde Festival 2016 where MØ will play the iconic Orange Stage.   The auction will take place between 10 and 21 June  and the income will be donated in full to Dansk Flygtningehjælp's humanitarian aid in and around Syria.   Make your bid here: roskil.de/MØauction,4

Muse and Faith No More are on tour in Europe this summer. Book them please.,0
Hey Roskilde!  How come you don't create an aftermovie? I've seen the Roskilde Moments  but can't seem to find one similar to the likes of Tomorrowland or Balaton Sound. It could be  that I just can't find it on your Youtube channel.  Regards  A guy who wants to show his foreign friends why Roskilde is more awesome than the puny festivals they go to.,0
Copenhagen  now orange thanks to you guys. That's the spirit! Lots of looove!!,0
Like mikkel says Rihanna and stuff like that aint festival matrerial its radio music.  I liked to Work at Roskilde 5 years in row  but when they made it to 4 and not 3 watches then i stopped. and the program last year wasnt anything to say hurra for. they use to much radio/ pop music that there shouldnt be that much of on Roskilde.,0
Roskilde was originally a rock festival .. Nuff said 5 6mil for rihanna o_O,0
Well  Robbie Williams headlined the festival twice in '99 and '02. He's about as rock as Rihanna. Who whined back then?,0
And we are happy that changed :),0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm3m9iEnZJA I hope we will get Blur to Roskilde Festival :),1

Roskilde Festival has the coolest and most beatiful festival-goers in the world. These fantastic portraits were taken by Søren Solkær Starbird at Roskilde in 2009. As a thank you Søren would like to offer you guys a free download of his newest book CLOSER -> http://sorensolkaer.com/ebook. Enjoy and have a wonderful weekend!,29
I must be doing something wrong  I get a pdf file with only the cover of it? Any help?,0
The Ebook does not work :/,0
I got the same problem - no pages to turn?! the fil is only 14 mb?,0
I know what the problem is :-) It is an interactive pdf  which means you can turn the pages  kind of like in a real book  by using the mouse  or the back-and-forth arrow keys. Hope that helps!?,0
:s nope I only got one page to turn?,0
Wait I got it if you make your pdf reader larger it works thanks!,0
What you mean make it larger? I only have the cover pic  and Im dragging with the mouse and punching arrow keys - still nothing happens,0
in the right upper corner press the button to make your program appear larger on your screen and then press your arrow keys to go to the next page it should work like that  it worked for me,0
Hi Marie  hope you made it work? Are you using Adobe Reader? Or else  you can download it for free here: http://tinyurl.com/cpddgn. The ebook can be viewed with other applications  but it works well with Adobe Reader. If you still have trouble viewing the book  maybe it is because you can't turn the pages? In that case: Use the mouse to turn the pages (go to a corner  see the page starting to flip a bit  then click and drag the page). After turning the first page  you can use the back-and-forward-keys  or the mouse. Hope it helps you!,0
Hi Martin and Maxim  I just wrote this as a response to Marie  further up in the comment thread - hope it will help you  Martin  as well: Are you using Adobe Reader? Or else  you can download it for free here: http://tinyurl.com/cpddgn. The ebook can be viewed with other applications  but it works well with Adobe Reader.

I am sure MUSE are coming  and perhaps also MOTLEY CREW.. Motley crew is a cliché for a roughly organized assembly of characters. Typical examples of motley crews are pirates  Western posses. These photos have a roughly organised assembly of characters in the photos  named Roskliders:-),0

Thanks for all your guesses. Guess it’s time for the corrects answers and the menaing behind everything. One act at a time. MUSE They did the song “Supremacy”  and it really sounds like their contribution for an 007 song - guess it wasn’t chosen. So we chose to show you a picture of the agent (in the shape of Daniel Craig) with a huge minus in front. Too hard? OFF! Their name is a pun on mosquito repellent - just as was the case with Black Flag (Keith Morris was the first singer in that one). ST: VINCENT We found an amateur recording of one of her shows online  zoomed in on the guitar  cropped the thing in blurry and pixelated quality. Still someone got it. Colour us impressed! ILOVEMAKONNEN This one doesn’t need any explanation. We found one of those ‘I love’ stickers  erased the object of the love and left it there. BROKEN TWIN This was a sound bite of her live cover of Johnny Thunders’ “You Can’t Put Your Arms Around A Memory”. It’s right here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p72g1vPh-QE&feature=youtu.be&t=2m59s   MYRKUR The woman behind this black metal band is Danish  residing in L.A.  and she used to do pop music. The picture we used was a screenshot from an early song of hers. Certainly a different expression compared to what she does now. http://youtu.be/XxCunreNOMo?t=2m TROPKILLAZ If you check out their logo you will notice two symbols  a palm tree and a machine gun. We went for the former. FUTURE BROWN This transatlantic electronic group did some music for an art event at Museum of Modern Art in New York. In short  MoMa. We just used thier logo. GOAT This Swedish band sound like they come from an African country - and they dress up in beautiful costumes and masks. We found an illustration of a Chinese mask  trying to confuse you. It didn’t help. Someone guessed it. THE WAR ON DRUGS One of their most popular songs is called “Red Eyes” - so we put in an inflamed eye. Simple as that. Was it too easy? DALHOUS They make weird music videos with blurry analoge colours drifting across the screen. We took a screenshot of one of them  put them inside an old TV  and… left you clueless  -) KATE TEMPEST She’s a multi artist. She writes screenplays  poems  novels and music. And her stories can move from one media to another. On her debut album each song is a chapter in a story. Kate Tempest plans on continuing this story in a novel  which is out sometime in 2015. Our design showed an arrow from a record to a book. THE TALLEST MAN ON EARTH The tallest he isn’t. In fact  Kristian Matsson is 170 cm. So that’s what we put in as a height. Someone got this right! PALLBEARER You could hear some guy saying “This is the first band I’ve done actual singing in”. The person talking is Brett Campbell  lead singer in Pallbearer. It was from this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjVZzsoQVLM  AV AV AV A Danish electronic three-piece whose name means ‘ouch  ouch  ouch’. We found an illustration of someone in pain and put the Danish flag on him. DEAFHEAVEN The cover of their album “Sunbather” is meant to show someone looking right at the sun with the eyes closed  so you sort of look through the eyelids. We liked this idea of the sun  so we found a drawn sun.  BATIDA Pedro Coquenão is from Portugal and Angola. He makes music based on kuduro  and then he mixes it with older Angolan music styles. There’s a documentary called I Love Kuduro  we took some design from that. KASAI ALLSTARS They have a song on their latest album called “As They Walked Into the Forest on a Sunday  They Encountered Apes Dressed as Humans”  so we found a monkey dressed up  of course.,0
Johan  More than one. You will have to wait a bit longer for the exact number.,0
Pink Floyd got disbanded 20 years ago. They just made an album to symbolize the fact that they're over. But i guess Roger Waters is a possibility.,0
You're famous now! And all a blur :-),0
I -was- wondering what on earth they were doing with that piece of machinery  they were carrying around and placing on the ground at regular intervals. Now I know :),0
Yeah and they would def give me the orange feeling a summer night in early july ??RF2015,0
The Prodigy....Chase & Status...???,0
Does that mean another Jack White-appearance? :D,0
what sign ?,0
So its.. Blur?,0
I see :O,0
New Album out but i understand its jus a dream* see pic ??,0
AC/DC are rumored for Glastonbury and Rock Werchter and maybe also Roskilde. Never say never. If Rolling Stones can play Roskilde  then AC/DC can also play. Brian Johnson in AC/DC says to Classic Rock magazine in 2012 that AC/DC want to play more festivals in the future :),0
And in 2008 say Brian Johnson this http://www.rockfreaks.net/news/6804,0
I guees the eye is from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcI5rNR5TGM,0
Problem is that the comursial festivals pay more chash for those bands that can take sick amunt of cash to play. But i def need a big metal headliner for me too travel once again from the high north to Roskilde festival.,0
Metal hammer says some months ago AC/DC rumored to play Roskilde. Let s and wait. Rolling Stones played this year and Bruce Springsteen in 2012 so why not AC/DC in 2015. They are on the same leave as The Stones and Springsteen. All of them big stadiums acts.,0
Try this  Mikkel: https://soundcloud.com/roskilde-festival/teaser-4,0
Maybe David Gilmour. New album and tour in 2015.,0
That is true!,0
Saw that one too! Maybe it's a reference to Kanye :O,0
Would'nt that be an arrogant fish?,0
Doesnt work for me also. Only one soundclue ?,0
Blur should return to Roskilde :),0
Is that an 'Evil Eye' maybe? Fu Manchu!?,0
Just ran a google image search on the KoL picture - they are not quite indentical. Two palm trees on both  but not the same picture,0
true and the total amount of likes of all TBA artist is 853.000  so we can forget KoL  The National  Icona Pop,0
Muse will play Tinderbox instead.,0
And Download.. Which already has a great lineup,0
wat are the nationalities,0
Thanks Kim for the invite ...   :),0
Who is Kim?,0
More importantly  who is Steven Mckown?,0
Well ...Kim Løvenskjold Elm  (a friend of mine) asked me to like Roskilde Festival. I did  and thanked him for the invite.  More importantly (?) who is Steven Mckown? That would be me Simon  what do you want to know?,0
Steven Mckown is a bad ass Beards Man. and ho is Simon.?,0
Haha  welcome to our page  Steven,0
Hi RF it is only me.,0
Most gracious brother  thanks,0
Simon is confused  that's who he is! :P,0
Splendid. Nice to meet you  Steven :) It was merely an attempt to make a joke - which then crashed and burned :P,0
No worries brother ... why would or should  anybody know who I am!?  Hahaha ...but nice to meet you too! I like a good joke too!,0
The signup for  Camp of the Year  is OPEN!  Go here if you want to join -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/sign-up-for-camp-of-the-year-now/  Got a favorite camp at the festival? Let's hear some names and some love.,7
Music changes us. Are you ready for the journey?,58
So sad you didn't sign TERROR for Roskilde this year. Them being on Europe tour with their new album at the same time and everything. I had really hoped for them on the list. Very stoked about Hatebreed though!,0
Just a tip for all of you still looking for tickets: Don't give in to ticket scalpers. There are still LOTS of volunteering options  so you can get in much cheaper.  You usually get your ticket for putting down four 8-hour shifts during the festival's 8 days. Follow these two links:  http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/more/volunteer/rf-volunteers http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/more/volunteer/partner-volunteers,0
System Of A Down are touring next year. They should play Roskilde for first time ever at the festival next year :),0
Down the front in The Arena for Bastille #rf14 are they coming back on The Orange Stage for #rf15,0

Same thought ??,0
wanting to buy a full festival ticket - pm me,0
Niels 'Shoe' Meulman  an acclaimed artist from Amsterdam  revolutionized the art of writing with Calligraffiti (check out the pics) and this year he is going to paint the Grandstand Wall!   The Grandstand Wall at Roskilde Festival has a unique legacy. A lot of amazing artists have painted the wall over the years in numerous styles and genres. We can’t wait to see  what Meulman will come up with this year. You’ll find it at the opposite end of the Orange Stage  so remember to check it out!,5
Now that Rock Werchter have announced both Foo Fighters AND Muse  I must admit that I woul be really dissapointed  if I am not seeing at least one of these on the poster for RF15... I have already chosen going next year  so please dont let me regret that :p,0
Hoping for Snoop Dogg  Mac Miller  Real Estate and Flux Pavillion since they are already coming to scandinavia this summer!,0
Leave him alone :oo,0
Looking for a full roskilde ticket :) Willing to pay a bit extra.. help a roskilde brother out (Y),0
Kraftwerk's unique 3D show will light up Orange Stage Sunday night as this year's grand finale after 8 days of music at Roskilde Festival!,458
doesn't it need to be completely dark for the show to work?,0
Where the hell is the programme?,0
looks like a good show but i'm confused  there are 4 guys that just stand and seem to do nothing?? i guess they are standing behind a keyboard but all 4 of them barely do any movement and i really does not look like the are using keyboards  their arms are barely moving. any ideas who they are or what the purpose is?,0
Yes thats why the show is 23 on sunday. https://www.facebook.com/events/520339294671142/,0
Ahh. That's new!,0
Where do you actually see that?,0
Edited my previous post,0
Not sure if trolling? haha. They are the band  dude. They're DJ's. It's like any other DJ show. They mix and mash-up the music during the show. I guess their  thing  is to look almost like robots live  hence the very limited movement from the group  so that's why the 3D show is there too  to keep you entertained.,0
The programme isn't out until the last names are announced. Don't expect it until mid June.,0
Mathias: take a look at their live DVD  Minimum - Maximum  and the live mix of Music Non Stop.,0
its hard to improve on perfection  but they have achieved it,0
This is not predictable  pop  music... You need to BE there and soak up the whole spectacle.   :-),0
Bands on tour in 2012 ,0
We need some Balkan at Roskilde! And it would be very classy if you got some technical death metal bands too  plz. You're gonna lose a bunch of people who normaly spend a week in Roskilde if you're not getting more of those little  but very interesting bands to come.,0
The success from RF11 on Grooveshark is back - on Spotify! Don't forget to share the link with your friends: http://j.mp/rfs12  Much more info on RF forum: http://j.mp/rfs12forum Feedback is always appreciated.,2

Probably the new festival tinderbox,0
Or maybe Copenhell.,0
The company behind tinderbox is foo fighters agents in europe...,0
We wanted to see when our Facebook fans are active on Facebook - but all we could see was a whale.,15
Whale is playing RF15? Great news :D,0
After reading this.. I've come to this conclusion... It has to be AC/DC or RATM for Roskilde 2015! I'm sure!,0
http://youtu.be/ytXFgvFem6Y,0
Kom for at se dette. Not disappointed. :D,0

Can you please book Leonard Cohen? Thank you!,0
Hej Roskilde Festival  your english description of Rockwool shelter is wrong and missleading again !!!  There is no  lock  on the door  ......but there is possibility of a putting on a 6mm padlock if you bring it yourself.  I bought my ticket 1 hour after ticket opening (inkl. Rockwool shelter) and Ive been to Roskilde since 89' . Many forigners complained last year about the missleading Info.  And also wrote it on all the question forms  surveys and told political visitors who came to see our Rockwool shelter area. See you in 2015 :-),0
With only two small metalacts booked so far i am looking forward to see what is coming up.May I suggest Nightwish and Children of bodom?,0
There are at least three metal acts on the programme for now: DevilDriver  Nasum and Warbringer.,0
Two in my opinion.Nasum is something else.And they are all minor acts,0
Grindcore IS a metalgenre that is.. Nasum is huge in its genre and an inspiration for tons of extreme bands.. Expect Ministry very soon!,0
I know Nasum i am from sweden.I have seen them live once.Anyway Ministry would be nice.,0
BTW is is nice to talk to you guys again.,0
AC/DC Have Confirmed Their 2015 Rock Or Bust World Tour  With the release of the Rock Or Bust Album Dec 2. AC/DC Have confirmed Country's Australia  New Zealand  North America  South America & Plenty Plenty more Countries/Venues  will be seeing them in 2015  Nothing has been said if Phil Rudd will be present on that Tour  Or if so who will replace him. TIME TO PLAY BALL.  I hope they will play Roskilde in 2015 :),0
Clair from Scotland is writing a paper for university on Roskilde Festival  and she's asking:  Can you help explain the orange feeling?,5
Cool new webpage and all.. BUT i cant seem to find the forum  or the TV section.... Gone forever? Coming back? Or am i blind?,0
Please get Foo Fighters back to Roskilde. Almost 10 years since they played last time in Roskilde. They should come back next year :),0
D-A-D TIL ROSKILDE TAK,0
Coming with Anathema  ),0
Has it been announced somewhere  how the entrance part is gonna be this year. I think it could be a very helpfull thing to know on before hand  as it can be quite a frustrating thing to arrive at the East entrance as the queue system has changed a lot through the last years. It would be nice to know on before hand,0
It's the same system as in 2011 and 2012.,0
What entrance to book when planning to arrive at the festival train station?,0
The train station entrance doesn't open the same time as the other entrances AFAIK.,0
ahh thank you :) last time was 2011 for me  i recall taking the train but maybe we were late,0
What the bells are you guys on about?,0

Falling in love at a festival should be easy... Or is it? Blow a kiss at this post if you've ever fallen in love at a festival (Roskilde or any other).,106
I broke up with someone at the festival ? does that count ?  ),0
So you can fall in love  if you are a model ?,0
I fell in lust on Roskilde Festival:-),0
I think you have romanticized the idea of waking up at Roskilde You wake up dirty with a hangover and covered in sweat because the tent is so hot.,0
I fell in love with my husband at Roskilde 7 years ago - Roskilde forever <3,0
I fell in love with Roskilde Festival.. :) does that count? :),0
Met my girlfriend in a yellow tent five years ago. Still going strong!,0
2 years ago  and are now living together  more in love than ever:),0
Roskilde - The Experience: Only if you then fell in love with someone else  -),0
Oskar Boskar Andsager: Yeah well. Video's a bit polished and sweet  but I'm pretty sure you can fall in love as a  normal  smelly person with crocked teeth  as well (not by any means saying that you are such a person)  :-),0
Paul Burgess: Guess that kinda counts,0
It takes less than a minute...I know what I'm talking about!,0
Rasmus Linnemann Buggeskov: What? No way. At Roskilde the sun is always shining  the tents are airconditioned  the hangovers just a fleeting glimpse in the morning breeze  the make-up always perfect (even on the guys) and the people all happy and beautifull..... Well...in spirit at least  -),0
Thomas Henriksen: That counts!,0
Orgh nice to know :D!,0
:) I have no idea,0
Less then a minute. How old are you?,0
Like Rasmus wrote. Fell in love with festival. :),0
We brought our daughter there first time in 2011  when she was 8 months old. She loves it too :-),0
and we have been going on the same date every year on Roskilde ever since. Eating the same food  doing the same stuff.. unfortunately I am not going this year  but she is.,0
Hell yeah! Midtfyns festival 94. Still going strong  who says a festival love can't last:),0
We met 2006 in front of the orange stage while Roger Waters was playing. We are getting married this summer. I love you Anna Pour-Mozaffar!,0

SUBMIT A COOL FESTIVAL APP IDEA AND WIN TICKETS TO ROSKILDE (first deadline: 1 May at 12:00)  Roskilde LABS has been up and running for a month now  and lots of neat (and crazy) ideas have already hit our inbox.   Festivalgoer Sigrid Veber has submitted an idea for  QueueControl   an app that uses cleverly placed web-cams to give you an overview of the queues at the stages  bars  toilets etc. So even though queues at Roskilde might be cosy  with  QueueControl  you are always one step ahead.  Got your own idea for an app (do-able or not) and want to submit it to the competition? Go here -> http://labs.roskilde-festival.dk/competition/,8
What does  first deadline  mean?,0
An app that tells you not to use apps for everything  all the time.,0
App for Windows phones. Thank you. Elsewhere... I don't care about apps  ),0
An App that aims at the warm up. So a map that shows the campsite. Camps will be able to place their camp on this map with their activities. The app will generate per campsite (for example Area P) a timetable with upcoming events  you can join and share them through Facebook/twitter. So for example 21.00 - 22.30 moviequiz by camp tarentino and Food party by camp Breakfast at 11 - 12.00. Also it will be able to discuss the events and share pictures. In this way many 'stages' will be created through festivalgoers themselves.   Through the connection with Facebook you are also available to see who is coming! Missing friends? Just invite them...,0
How about a “fix-my-festival” app. An app where you can tip festival officials on a problem that needs to be fixed – something broken  out of order or messy. You take a picture and/or describe the problem and tag it with your GPS-location. A feed will be send to the festival headquarter where they can prioritize and fix the problems.,0
We've actually found some dedicated volunteer programmers who are gonna make a Windows Phone app this year  so stay tuned Ulla Mortensen,0
Koen: You're actually describing what will be in our official app again this year (Camp Events where everybody can mark their own parties/events  see it on the map  find it in the calendar etc.).,0
Jonas Binder Porsborg: That could be a cool app  yes  ),0
Ole B. Hoffmann: 'first deadline' = deadline for the idea-part of the dual competition. Afterwards there's a part where app designers actually code apps for all of you to enjoy -> http://labs.roskilde-festival.dk/competition/,0
Maybe the app can include a social feed  where other festival guests can see the posted problems  and help fix them,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me5ti_F_iTc These guys are available!,0
LAST CHANCE TO WIN TICKETS TO THE SOLD-OUT ROSKILDE FESTIVAL 2016  Roskilde Festival has a long history  and hundreds of artists have played here since we started back in 1971.

Sympathy for the devil -The rolling Stones. Some of the best times <3,0
Muse - Starlight ??????  First time I heard Muse was in 2007  my first year at Roskilde. I had been in an accident earlier that year  and was unsure if I was gonna be able to go. But I did. And it poured down the whole festival  but I survived! ?? With bandages over half of my body  and plasticbags to cover from the Rain ???? And I was sold after that year.  Later I saw them in 2010  and I remember Roskilde festival playing the song while me and my friends were standing in line to come in to Roskilde. The weather was cloudy. And suddenly someone tore down the fence  people were running like mad  and I just stood there with my bags watching. The sun began to shine and Starlight roamed over the area. Beautiful and extreme moment of joy. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.   Last time I saw them and heard the song was last year  2015. And all the memories came back ??   I love you Roskilde Festival! ??,0

Look at this! Orange Stage made by 14 000 LEGO bricks - and the audience consist of 2000 LEGO men!   This work of art is to be found at LEGO World in Copenhagen this weekend  but who is the creator?

Maybe you could call extra bladet and ask them for kontakt info  just an idea ^^,0
I'm guessing https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003320410263 or https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000161654044  But yea - call EB for contact info :),0
Steffen Alex Lundsgaard Thomsen  actually it's Volbeat.,0
Rakel Ósk Þorgeirsdóttir  we could - but we like this approach better :-),0
Likely  as others say  that it's Morten Øberg  considering this old forum post: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/roskilde_babble/what_is_roskilde/,0
Nice! :D,0

We proudly present 120 Days as the first Norwegian band on the poster. The Norwegians play cold  dark electronic rock that sounds like Kraftwerk’s hometown Düsseldorf in the 70s and Manchester in the 90s.  (This makes us wish that there was only 120 Days until Roskilde 2012  but it really is 135 days.)  http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/120-days-coming-to-roskilde-festival-2012/,13
Giv us the map!  Do it  do it now!,0
Roskilde volunteer photographer Mia Dernoff's picture from #RF14 won the GAFFA.se Photo Awards 2014! Congratulations  Mia.  In the photographer’s own words: “An emotional man is standing in the front row and he is clearly affected by the band Cancer  playing on stage in front of him at Roskilde Festival. A few minutes before the picture was taken he hides his face in his hands. Then he looks up and tears are running down his cheeks. That picture reminds me of when I myself am touched by concerts  when everything around me is standing still and the music goes right to the heart and causes strong emotions  whatever it is sorrow or happiness.”  The jury's motivation:  This photograph catches the essence of live music at its best. The distance between the stage and the audience dissolves  the music and the emotions go straight through all filters to the guy in the picture. This year’s music photograph has an intensity and is a photograph leaving a lot said about the circumstances but it shows everything about music’s wonderful ability to touch people.    http://gaffa.se/photo,23

We are proud to announce that the construction of Roskilde Festival Højskole will start next year  and the school will open in 2017.  It will be built in the old industrial area Musicon in Roskilde. The educational profile of Roskilde Festival Højskole is the sum of the competences needed in the development and realization of cultural and social events – it will offer courses in e.g. communication  journalism  leadership  architecture  design and music.,45

Looking for a full ticket! Message me pls!,0
I'm selling a full festival ticket with east entrance for the ordinary price.,0
We've donated DKK 500 000 (approx. EUR 67 000) to Rådmandsgade 60  a Copenhagen-based shelter for young homeless people.  Thanks to all festival-goers and volunteers for making this donation possible!  Photo: Mia Dernoff,57
I hate the  finger-heart-photo  but i am very proud to be a part of Roskilde Festival.. Next year i'd rather we all  flip the bird  and donate 600.000kr,0
I mean you can't expect me to believe that the people who put the festival together don't get paid?,0
^what are you talking about? I think you should Google  non profit   ),0
30 000 volunteers + a little paid staff. Same structure as pretty much any larger NGO.  But you're missing the point: after each festival we donate every single cent and start from scratch. That's non-profit.,0
So every year You go Out and get investors to fund the festival ?,0
Jordan  rather  you should imagine us going to the bank on a yearly basis  getting quite a big overdraft agreement.,0
I mean 500 000dkk is roughly 80-90 000 dollars are their really not a larger Profit from a festival that has roughly 110 000 guests that's barely a dollar per guest :p Eller så er det c.a 5kr Per person,0
Glad I could donate 5kr out of the 2000 I spent on the ticket,0
Jordan  if you think just a bit and take a look through the history of Roskilde Festival  you will find out that all profits are not donated to just one cause  but rather a range of causes is selected.,0
Well  these 500.000 DKK aren't the only money donated this year. This is just a small piece of the cake.   FYI Roskilde Festival being non profit is a requirement to be exempt from VAT (moms). Thus  they are audited every year by government approved auditors to ensure that ALL the profit indeed DOES go to charity.,0
I bet you guys are røde blok ??????,0
Jordan  this is just one of many causes we donate to. There's a society behind Roskilde Festival called Roskilde Festival Charity Society - that's the organiser of the festival. And if you've ever been a volunteer at the festival  you can become a member of the society.  Mads Due  we're not ready to reveal the full amount yet. But we will soon at the next general assembly.,0
Morten  you got it!,0
So much love  ),0
Why is it   that those ppl doin fkn nothing for others always complain about ppl  helping others the wrong way???!!,0
cause its our money thats helping people do  nothing ,0
I don't understand why everyone gets so butt hurt when you tell the truth  an NGO that is non profit Is still gonna make a profit and I think it's clear that the the majority of extra revenue that the festival makes is obviously being distributed to people who are making insane salaries  When roughly 5kr of everyone's ticket is the charity  I mean you can't realistically think that 500k is a lot Of Money donated from a festival of that magnitude and if you do then. You are the one that should bliv væk næste år  And do some Research,0
Jordan  that's nonsense. All profits go to charity.  This is just a small piece of the cake.,0
The perfect warm-up for this year's festival season - check it (and someone should look into doing something similar at Roskilde)!,0
I see your tall guy and raise you an aerial drone :-)  http://vimeo.com/49676399,0
Attach the tall guy to the drone  then we're talking!,0
You choose your ticket in instalments as a payment option at Billetlugen when you buy a  normal  9-days ticket. At the very end of the process you should be able to select this type of payment.,0

He is also not in this photo and he will not bet at next AC/DC video for the song Play Balll. And i hope they will headline next year. Best live band ever :),0
när släpps spelschema/ greetings from svedala,0
Tickets booked  can't wait for the summer.  Now fingers crossed for The Prodigy.  Come on Roskilde you know you want to  -),0
Will we get more new acts soon ?,0
Let's see. We're trying to batch up more acts for each release  which ultimately means fewer releases (but NOT fewer bands),0
Ok  I m hoping for some good rock n roll like AC/DC :),0
And Foo Fighters :),0
We know you do :-),0
Good and i hope these bands will play Roskilde next year :),0
So hey  what have happened to the history-page on your website? It seems to be gone.,0
Good news for fans of electronic music. We add Martyn  Shlohmo and TODDLA T (billed The Toddla T Sound) to the lineup.,23

Bob Mould (of Hüsker Dü fame) is touring with a performance of Copper Blue. Just a tip! www.bobmould.com,0
damn that would be awesome!,0
When are you revealing the full line up?,0
Usually the big band release is in mid april. It's the same this year  but even after that they keep adding names. The programme isn't 100% complete until a couple of weeks before the festival.,0
thanks man! But i was actually hoping for an exact date in april  but anyway thanks,0
Hold on a minute... it's there somewhere.,0
Shouldn't we continue the good vibrations from Sunday's Grammy Awards and have the Beach Boys visiting Roskilde 2012?,0

Danish artist group Superflex are currently working on the constructing of the Flagship Shelters/Bottle Collectors VIP project that will grace Art Zone at this year's festival.   These modifications of famous fashion brands' flagship stores  however  are not a celebration of the fashion industry. The modifications will be downscaled and built out of cheaper materials  commenting on issues such as consumption  social injustice and how to prioritise financial and social resources.

Hey Roskilde Festival ! :)  We are a couple dedicated roskilde goers who are working hard to collect all the events happening at the festival. We were wondering if you would give us a shoutout at your facebook page? We offer a interactive and free event calendar that everyone can use to get an overview of the things happening.

Where is the pre-entrance to silent and Clean and when does it open on the Saturday?,0
Have a look here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?accommodation=silent-and-clean,0
I also need pre-entrance to south to get there? It is not enough to just have the pre-entrance to silent and Clean ?,0
Tthat depends on when you want to enter. If you want to be among the very first at 16:00  you need entrance booking. If you don't mind waiting a couple of hours  entrance booking is not necessary. Remember  your S&C booking is valid until 24:00 the same day.,0
So I need South entrance to get in at 16???,0
That's right,0
Do you mean Friday or Saturday?,0
Saturday. We're not open Friday :-),0
Ok thanks! I have now bought south entrance so I can get in and then get to silent and Clean.  So first you show the ticket for south entrance and then you show your ticket for pre- entrance for silent and Clean?  How will you keep track of who is who? Who has and who hasn't got the pre-entrance to silent and Clean?,0
We're talking two different entrances - one leading into the general campsite (that's your Wouth booking) and another leading into S&C. And we check for bookings at both places.,0
Ok so first you go into South entrance and then into Silent and Clean if you have a ticket for it? Sorry I just need to be sure ?,0
Pharrell Williams will play Roskilde Festival 2015.  Tickets are for sale now including special camping offers. Buy your tickets and get a pre-booked area for your camp. www.roskilde-festival.dk  10 our of 169 acts announced so far.,715

But why?,0
There goes a big chunk of the budget .. Sadly Roskilde is listening to the radio way too much and hiring because of that .. Where's your integrity  Roskilde ?? ..,0
Time to say goodbye to this pop festival and look to the other exciting stuff going on in other countries. Ses  whatever pfff.,0
Cool. I guess the pop-fans got their headliner now. How about some rock next headliner eh?,0

Girls only,0
I thought wednesday was your anouncement day? 0o,0
It means no police with dogs looking for drugs on girls while they are on rollerblades.. Simple as that!.. About time that got forbidden! I mean  its hard enough for small girls in dresses being on drugs at RF with there usual rollerblades on  trying to skate in the mud  but then  drug hounds!! Glad RF finally listen to all those girls! Thumps up!,0
The XX? (X on Ex),0
Could be Girlschool  :P,0

No boys allowed,0
Rage against the machine!,0
No boys or pets allowed? Just great.,0
Ed sheeran because of his new album X  he Also  Got a dog's footstep as a kind of symbol.. I keep my fingers crossed! :D,0
When is the announcement Roskilde Festival?,0
All about the girl...,0
Thanks for all your guesses. Always interesting to see how you try to 'crack' our teasers. It seemed like you took this one a bit too literally. We were being somewhat literal - but in a different sense.  The simple explanation:  In the drawing you see a boy and a girl. We cross out the boy  meaning to put focus on the girl. And THIS is the literal part: the word 'girl' is what we focus on.  Pharrell Williams' latest album from 2014 is called G I R L.,0
Girls Aloud ???? but why???,0
announcement is that it will not be allowed to bring your pets :D,0
Well that´s great  you´ve managed to please the broadest  least engaged possible crowd and secure the sales of a bunch of tickets. You should now focus on booking Rage Against The Machine to balance out your credibility.,0
When will the last 15 guests be announced? ,0
A few more artists will be annonced somewhere between now and the festival.,0
That's a very poor answer.,0
... but probably the most exact one they can give.,0
Yup  it probably is. But at the same time the least exact one even possible. It reminded me of Casper & Mandrilaftalen anyway.,0
Can you tell  if its still during the Wednesdays or?,0
any headliners?????????,0
You've gotta sign Wu Tang! Please Roskilde! Saturday Night they will play its gonna be a blast!,0
Ingrid is preparing a unique Orange Stage show for you feat Lykke Li  Peter Bjorn and John  Miike Snow  coco morier and Joakim Åhlund.   Their special guests are yet to be announced...  Read more: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/music-collective-ingrid-at-roskilde-festival-2013/,10
will their special guests be considered as being a part of the last 15 announcements or?,0
Hopefully not.,0
That sounds bloody amazing!,0
Looks like jesus on mdna performing with his disciple´s! :p,0
When are you announcing Bon Jovi?,0
Looking forward to it,0
i think i know who their special guests are at least one ive heard a rumor,0
Awwww  Orange  I had my hopes set for GREEN stage...,0
I don't think so.,0
They will not be considered part of the last announcements.,0

Assaad Lakkis ,0
Roskilde Festival will we get some teaser about next headliner :) ?,0
I got Snapchat from you. Looking forward to know about the first Headliner soon. I m hoping for AC/DC :),0
Orquestra Buena Vista Social Club are touring in Europe next summer around the time of Roskilde. That would be a very nice booking for RF15.,0
Insane line-up..,0
Woooow... :o,0
Roskilde is better IMO :) but when that is said  it would be awesome it Mumford and Sons and The Hives came to Roskilde aswell :),0
Where do i go to find some dedicated Roskilde Festival 2013 playlists to stream? Spotify  Last.fm etc?? Where do you listen to RF13 artists?,0
I have seen a list on the forum  for Spotify.,0
There is always a lot of dedicated line-up surfers who make great lists on both Spotify  Last.fm and WIMP. If you have WIMP we have a small collaboration this year and are making an extra few playlists using that service,0
This list is quite good: http://open.spotify.com/user/113211636/playlist/0rgf5FcEoogl0YvsYvOL6c It contains all the bands published so far except the ones from the posterrelease which I expect will be added this week.,0
I created this event on LastFM as i could not find anything for RF2013 http://www.last.fm/festival/3577993+Roskilde+Festival+2013,0
@Peter Moore Kofod we are aware that a lot of music sites often list and/or un-list artists but luckily this has nothing to do with her concert at Roskilde.,0
Why oh why  haven't you booked Iggy Azelea? One of the hottest up-coming young international musicians this year! Remember her for next year  okay?! ,0
How do I find out which bands are playing on each day? ,0
Not official yet but try http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/lineupartists/2013_schedule/,0
It won’t be official until mid-June.,0
HÅLD KÆF! <3 MERE MÆDL! MERE MÆDL! MERE THRASH  MERE FOLK  MERE BLACK  MERE DØØ! :D,0

Hi Atli.  Time will tell... :-),0
Hi fans of Roskilde Festival. :)  We are three master students from Performance Design  University of Roskilde  doing a research about online live-streaming of concerts. Roskilde Festival has been transmitting several of their concerts for the last couple of years  and we would love to hear your opinion about your experience with that. By responding our questions in this survey  you also get the opportunity to win a gift certificate to iTunes  so you can buy even more great music :-) Thank you in advance See you at RF'15!  Morten  Rikke & Sandra,0
It is close to unforgiven  that this outstanding live band never has been staged at Roskilde . . .,0
I hope they're trying to catch AC/DC - might be the last chance to have them on the Orange Stage,0
no Blink 182 this year.,0
day off I'd recon :),0
true that! then maybe they'll get a one-day ticket and visit as guests  ) *trollface*,0
Theoretically they could play. I mean  TVOTR did a similar stunt this year where they played a week in a row and thus managed to squeeze Roskilde in. Typically though  a band would reserve a day like that for a break...,0
yeah  also my guess. And it's a pretty long run for a band that isn't really THAT depended on a lot of show to make money (like the band Cancer Bats that does 34 shows in 28 days or something). And my guess is that they're getting a little bit  tired  at old age.. lol :P,0
Mumford and sons  RHCP och Temper trap tack :),0
Mumford and sons and Temper Trap are playing at another Danish festival  so they won't be present.,0
ah  didn't know that  wicch one?,0
there will be official merch of the band in the festival? :),0
We are super excited about welcoming you to the brand new Art Zone at Roskilde Festival 2016.   Here's a small sneak peak of what to expect.,4
When will the map be ready?,0
Very soon.,0
Will you be a pre-sale on Beer again this year?,0
Yes  it will be possible to buy beers before the festival.,0
Thank you as always for your quick responses.  Make it so easy for Camp Wolfpack from USA to plan!  #RF16 #sharetheorangefeeling #RoskildeTrip7,0

http://yaticket.com/promo/ac-dc_tour2015/index.htm Looks like AC/DC on the way to Denmark next year and if this is true. I hope they will play Roskilde :),0
If you happen to have some cash over to book somone book this guy.  He may also settle for a random mcdonalds menu  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8NmPVs1Z0GU,0
The gravel pit at the campsite is slowly being filled = more camping space = WIN!  Perhaps we should bring one of the projects from last year's 'Reclaim the gravel pit'-contest to life: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/the-gravel-pit-is-filled-up-with-creative-ideas/,29
thank you for booking him :3 this will be a fantastic experience  no doubt about it!,0

Hey there   Being in the event industry  you know that a great party is ALL in the details  from the music selection to the wristbands! I work for a company called  Wristband Bros. and they create one of a kind  inexpensive (but high in quality) silicone wristbands that are often sold by our clients for 5X the amount we sell them to you for - a total steal. Also as a special Facebook deal  we’re offering 15% off any order  big or small. The offer is good until the end of the month.  Would love to schedule a time to talk to go over some of our offerings. You might have an upcoming event that could benefit from wristbands and not even know it! Oh  and we ship internationally   www.wristbandbros.com and https://www.facebook.com/wristbandbros Aubrey Burke aubss44@gmail.com,0
There will not be a stage at the lake this year  no. Street City is the name of our skatepark - but I don't think that is what you're refering to. Music in the Warm Up days will be concentrated on Pavilion Junior  Apollo Countdown and (to a lesser extent) Street City.,0
Skatepark i what i am referring to too.. I just need to know how to get in contact with them  cuz u don't answer on your info mail..,0
Dear festival  would it be possible  like last year  not to announce bands in genre groups?. I might be narrow minded  but when I don't care to much about metal/hip-hop/world music  and more for rock/indie/electronica/techno  I have to wait many weeks for band announcements in genres i like. If you mix the annoucements  I may be happy every week :-),0
It would be possible to do it in a lot of different ways :-) We try to mix it up  some releases will be more mixed in genres than others  it all depends on what we have confirmed. I can only ask you to stay patient there will be lots of music in your genres too as we approach the festival.,0

Hello everybody!  I'm currently writing my Master Thesis about music festivals and I have prepared some survey which is going to help me analyze the market.

AC/DC  Bruce Springsteen  Paul McCartney are all rumoured to do Summer festivalsin 2015. Wow  i hoping for AC/DC and Paul McCartney to headline next year. Will be awesome to have Macca and AC/DC :),0
http://www.musictimes.com/articles/7190/20140630/glastonbury-2015-based-michael-eavis-hints-paul-mccartney-david-bowie.htm Could be awesome to have Paul McCartney to Roskilde in 2015 :),0
Will be awesome to have AC/DC  Foo Fighters  Paul McCartney to Roskilde in 2015. Macca and AC/DC will maybe play Pinkpop in Holland  i hoping also Roskilde Festival 2015 :),0

When will the names for the upcoming bands to play at Pavillon Junior be official? :-),0
We expect to announce something this month.,0
We are proud to add some global music to the 2012 programme. Let’s welcome Terekaft and Boubacar Traoréo.,11
Who cares? MORE PUNK!,0
I don't care - MORE PUNK!,0
Is that all you have for us today on this great day :(  Looking forward to next week then  hopefully with some bands I actually want to hear :D,0
If you have five minutes to spare  watch this to hear why Boubacar Traoré is a great booking: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU7AcUiBs6g&feature=related,0
I just watched it... If I want to listen to that kind of music  I would just put on The Lion King...,0
Peter: You're in dire need of hearing-aid then...,0
(Seriously – comparing one mand and a guitar to an orchestral soundtrack by Hans Zimmer?),0
What Anders Cold said ^,0
And then plz no more world music this year,0
Music is personal guys  you can't convince me that it's any good.. I havent tried to convince you its bad... I just stated my opinion - and you said I needed hearing-aids...,0
fuck this shit. more punk..,0
Peter: Subjectivity and opinion is fine and good. I don't want to convince you at all and wasn't even trying to be funny. I merely pointed out that  objectively  your comparison is so way out there  it's like comparing Ramones to Elton John. That calls for hearing-aid.,0
The same genre can easily be played on different instruments  so don’t quite get your point at all? – Ramones and Elton are two different genres… don’t you agree?,0
You know aswell as I do that the Lion King soundtrack and Boubacar Traoré isn't the same genre. They're probably even farther apart than Elton John and Ramones. Heck  those two names both cover  pudgy white guys making noises . Hans Zimmer is German and writes film music for big orchestras. Traoré is one guy with a guitar and dabbles in an entirely different field of music.   I like punk too – check out the band I posted a little farther down the wall  but this is just silly.,0
And we have to correct ourselves - the West African band names are spelt: Terakaft og Boubacar Traoré.,0
What so just because it’s a white guy  he can’t make music in that genre? That just makes no sense…,0
That's not the issue. The issue is that Hans Zimmer's music can't by any means be considered even remotely connected to Boubacar Traoré's. It is not the same genre. Not even close.,0
Your Mama wasn’t even close…,0
Great bookings! Why is it so important for some people to shout out when they don't like something. I just don't get that stupidity. World music has always been an important part of Roskilde.,0
Nice addition  i enjoyed Tinariwens concert in 2010 so if this is just remotely is good as that concert it will be brilliant.,0
Who cares about your thoughts? MORE PUNK!,0
Peter: Go back to your Disney records please...,0
Great! I care! MORE FUNK!!,0
http://blogg.wimp.dk/2011/11/03/roskildefestival/  At the bottom of the page you can see the percentage of genres people want to see at Roskilde.. World music 1%,0
Peter: Problem with that is that a) It isn't Roskilde's own statistic and b) Many of the world music names are relatively unknown to people until they actually hear them at the festival  because they don't have the marketing machinery of say  your average punk band behind them  but still they attract tents full of people. You can't deduce anything from your link other than maybe something about the top-most names on the list. Plus c) Roskilde don't book exclusively after  what people want . If you want that  go to Northside. If you want a pure punk festival  go to Groezrock.,0
Usually though  there's about 8-10 punk names on the Roskilde roster. I don't expect this year to be any different. They will come.,0
Yes I am going to Groezrock  ) - And I will be at Roskilde for the party and the beer! - I’m just fucking with you  I have actually started to expect that the music on Roskilde is not to my liking (apart for a few names) – I know it hasn’t been for the last 2 years anyway… So I guess this year wont be any different. I just get upset every time I see a new announcement  and I think back to the good old days  when Roskilde was a rock festival… You know  real rock  ),0
Well  out of the 200 bands that are announced  I'm sure that there will be more than enough punk and  real rock  names to satisfy most people's needs :)  After all  what can one manage in one Roskilde week? 20? 25? concerts? That's only like 1/8 or 1/10 of the programme one has to actually like...,0
The best names on the line-up so far (:,0
Anders I went to 30 concerts last year and didn't even see all I wanted to see. Big up for roskildes diverse programme and giving the people something for every mood,0
Amazing booking! Could we please get Ballroom back ? Seems about time :),0
Aske Nielsen  it was just a stage. The music is still here. We just wanted to move it out of its isolated corner and try something new - like we always do.,0
Any good ideas for best Mojito mix ?,0
This is off topic  but keep the strawberry daiquiris flowing and I'm happy. :),0
@ dave: we are working on the elder mix. I agreee. Its good. @ fredrik: The (always fresh) strawberries will still be blended for u :-),0
No Teasers for tomorrow ?????????,0
Nope  no teaser this time around.,0
But i´m guessing that you will have some new names ready  wednesday is my favourite day because of the releases  a little bit sad really :-),0
not sad at all! I guess many feel the same...,0
So its not just me,0
There will be music tomorrow. Just no teaser.,0
thank thank thank you,0
No  nothing like that.,0
I'm hoping for some big electronic or funk/soul/jazz act,0
Modeselektor and Jamiroquai come to mind,0
Maybe something for the Apollo Stage,0
These are the exact reasons for us not doing teasers this time around.,0
Ahh you don´t want us to get our hopes up.,0
will there be JUSTICE?,0
Justice will play another festival in DK,0
Last part up and running!,1
Get A Place 5 x 5 metres is now sold out.   Read more about our other special accomodation offers here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping  But hurry up if you're interested  they are selling fast.,25
Hi Sonia. You can't book tents next to each other. You simply buy a tent  but if you arrive early and all of you together  it shouldn't be a problem to get tents next to each other.,0
Allan Hølchen  sorry no. It didn't really sell that well last year  so we're slimming the range of products a bit.,0
 One of the best concerts for me ever - emotionally and musically  —Mats Gustafsson  Fire! Orchestra  The Lake is broadcasting the amazing FIRE Orchestra show at 14:00 CET. Tune into www.thelakeradio.com,4

Kajsa Blomkvist i wish i was the one,0
Last year I gave a friend 52 reasons to go to Roskilde. Alien&Ko was one of them!,0
I think the first time I saw it was in 1996 or 1997  but believe it was an inflatable sheep back then. There was an artist  interview in one of the Danish papers where she said she totally lost focus due to an alien screwing a sheep or cow :D,0
Love those 2! Photo taken in 2013.,0
They're Danish.,0
Morten  want to share the other 51 reasons with us? Either here or at info@roskilde-festival.dk,0
ahahahahah :'D,0
Just what I was about to say,0
Oh that was a great concert!!!,0
Wannabe's ??,0
I still have dreams about it.,0
True! It was Atlas in 2001. The Danish newspaper Politiken wrote about her giggling. I hold the pole during the show and was lucky to grap her purse in the end. I can't remember how a drunk Swedish Atlas fan succeded in convincing me to hand it over to him :),0
Awesome  Morten. Please do send us a file with all the photos as well.,0
Stefan Kristian Petersen  we remember that design. Nice to hear that it made it onto T-shirts after all.,0
Now lets bring Sigur Ros  the coziest band in the world  they announced Bestival today  tomorrow  Roskilde?,0

Absolutely it is! I have very many of the above on my list :),0
Such a weak line-up. Guess you blew the budget on Rihanna... What a waste. You should have gotten Daft Punk  who people actually want's to listen to.,0
Tell you what: Call Them and ask DP  If you can convince them. You probably have a good chance  since Roskilde or any other festival obviously failed at this point. Do not know If you might have noticed any of the 717 posts so far stating that they are not touring in 2013. But hey  if you succeed  I will be the first to buy you food and beers! ,0
We just talked  they're thinking it over.,0

http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2013/03/12/rock-supergroup-kings-of-chaos-heading-to-south-africa Will be awesome if we can get them to Roskilde. Thanks for many good bands this year :),0
It's fucking awesome to see so many great metal and hard rock acts this year  but pleasepleaseplease don't fuck the metal audience in the ass again  like you did by putting for instance Motörhead on at the crack of noon last time they played.. Such a massive band needs to be playing at night and so does Queens of The Stone Age  Black Rebel Motorcycle Club  Kreator  Uncle Acid and so on! It's evil music and should be played at night!,0
For the love of god  get these kids on stage!,0
Let's get Jay Reatard's proper heirs to Roskilde!  ,0

You can't make an entrance booking until you've paid all instalments of your Flexpay ticket. We'll make sure that's it's possible for all Flexpay buyers to book at all entrances. More info will be sent to you later in the season.,0
That's your opinion. And we don't agree. We believe we have something very special on our hands - and that has nothing to do with music genres.,0
Then why do keep changing the festival!/culture event? If it is not broken dont fix it:-) one can say 'there is always Room for improvement'  but seriously guys! Thats not what you are doing!,0
Said the ugly pimps trying to distort our youth with mediocrity  because it is way  way  way cheaper to have a  cultural  festival  where people do shit themselves  than to pay hard working musicians to do what they do best. I call your bluff niggas,0
The British and Irish do seem to buy tickets incredibly quickly. I remember a few years ago when my cousin and I discussed going to Oxegen  but tickets sold out in just a few hours. It's just a different culture regarding tickets. Besides  Glastonbury haven't announced any headliners yet. They could go all polka this year  for all anyone knows.,0
Thats because people know that there Will be awesome Music there! At Roskilde now they headlining Rihanna and Robin. With all respect to their Music  they dont belong at a rock festival! Roskilde is fading and The spirit is gone!,0
Steffen  the festival has always changed. From day one. That's what we still do. The moment we don't change and stand still  that's when we fade out.  You  just  entered the festival history at a point which - seemingly - you want to stick to and which the festival should never move on from.,0
Thumbs up for the bookers at Roskilde Festival. Finally a really awesome lineup - I can hardly wait!,0
So  Roskilde..is this it ? no more bands ? me and my friends are realy confused about the headliners..are there no more surprises or..?,0
Tweet your questions to our music director using hashtag #RF13 and follow the Q&A session live!,0
Is it possible to buy voucher for beer this year? And if yes  where do I find them? :D,0
Yes  but not yet. We will post a link  when they are ready.,0
Fransk pige is looking for a Full week ticket ????  Help me Guys and I will be the happiest person ??,0
Hi im seeking a ticket for the whole festival. Please write a PM.!!!,0
Dear Roskilde Festival.   Thank you for the stream yesterday - a new and cool way to introduce the acts. As always  some are exited  some are not and a lot of rumors are going around about more artists to be released. Now  I don't know if your press strategy means that you won't comment. But if not  I think you would do yourself a favor if you either confirmed or denied these rumors. With them going strong  a lot of the audience will keep hoping and maybe become even more disappointed and negative.   Please  don't squeeze the lemon  to use a good  Danish saying.,0
They're broken up again. They played Roskilde last year btw.,0
They were great last year.. - But Shawn weren't there unfortunately  only in spirit  ),0
If you didn't get the chance yesterday..,21
I have been going to the festival since 2007...this program is the worst I have seen. Why did you make such a big fuss about the release when you only showed bands which were announced ages ago and no big names ? I really don't see the point. I went through the comments since yesterday and there are clearly more disapointed people than happy ones...but hey  it's in the air that 15 more bands will be announced including at least 1 headline so let's wait...and hope.,0
...and the ritual continues. How can people bash a program with 150+ artists only hours after it has been announced? Do you know all these bands already  or have you been up all night listening to their music? My main genres are rock and metal  and I find 23 bands that I already know and want see: QOTSA Slipknot Volbeat Airbourne BRMC Hatebreed Kreator Kvelertak Suicidal Tendencies Turbonegro Anaal Nathrakh Blood Command The Dillinger Escape Plan Ensiferum Goat Goatwhore Iceage Tyranny Uncle Acis & The Deadbeats Voodo Glow Skulls Baby In Vain Overthrow Solbrud,0
Which bands should have been there instead then?,0
daft punk would have been awesome.. the main artists are just not as big as they usually are  and the music in general is (imo) shit...,0
Trust me  Daft Punk is (togehter with Rage Against The Machine) at the very top of Roskilde's wish list. Rikke Øksner has expicitly said so. They have just been impossible to book (again). If Roskilde could  they would book them.,0
Oh the daft punk comment again. Will it ever stop for the 1014th time. DP has directly announced the will not be touring in 2013. Fat chance of getting them even if you had a budget of 2 billion  right?,0
Ups  hit the return jkey there... Apart from these rock/metal bands (that I know  mind you  I am sure there is more to be discovered) I find these 11 bands from other genres that I would like to see: Kraftwerk Animal Collective Jake Bugg Efterklang Bobby Womack Calexico Karpe Diem Vinnie Who When Saints Go Machine Mother Lewinsky MØ In both categories there is a mix of some really cool bookings of older bands (Uncle Acid to name only one of many)  and some forward thinking bookings (Owerthrow  anyone?)  plus where would you go to see Kraftwerk  Animal Collective  Kaje Bugg and Bobby Womack on the same ticket? And this is before I have listened to any of the many bands I don't know. Ah well. Next ritual coming up: The criticism of the collisions on the time table. Because all of a sudden there is apparently so many bands that people want to see (how is that possible if the program is so bad)  that they can't manage to see it all. Go figure...,0
I can understand how the Roskilde-festival is thinking. But to be frank people want names they recognize and are already in to. The emphasis on the lesser known names is too big imo. Not saying the booked bands make  bad  music. We just want to see the music we already know and love  thats all. I think this years lineup (atm) will disappoint a lot of ppl. On a more positive note. Maybe this year will have the most epic camp-parties instead :D,0
KSE was booket like 1 or 2 years ago. Why didn't you see them there?,0
Maybe he did...but since then they have a new great album out and their old singer back so it would be somewhat different,0
I agree with you on the  discovering new band . I myself have found really good things inside the new bands proposed this year  but some big names are missing  that's all. If you take a look at the editions from 07' to 09' (and also before that)  there were many more headliners and  it is personal  with a far better quality( I have nothing against Rihanna  but come on  let's be serious). I think it is normal that people are complaining if they have purchased a 250€ ticket and there's a risk they don't like the new bands and no band they know are coming. Don't you think?,0
I completely agree with that  110%  but having new and upcoming bands on the afternoon is not incompatible with having great known bands in the evening. I am just saying that the number and quality (once again  personal taste) of the headliners is going down with the years. And I'm not saying that I am not excited and looking forward to being there again  I just understand why some people were complaining  and it's mainly because this announcement was introduced as a great moment and 82 bands would be announced. No new headlines yesterday= frustration. Easily understandable. But it will wear off  eventually.,0
Any news about getting the app to work on Sony devices?,0
I asked Greencopper (the developer) on their Facebook page. They claim to be working on it. I think the problem is general for all their apps (it affects Northside's and Tinderbox' app too)  and it's not confined to Sony phones but seems to affect other Android M users as well.,0

Airbourne is also headliner and awesome band. Good bands :),0

Björk shows off her  Biophilia  album iPad and tells about her relationship with touch screens and elves in this interview. Followed by a great version of  Cosmogony . ,8
Have you heard of Beta State's cover of Björk's  unravel ?  You can find it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIdDblqeO_E&feature=g-all-s&context=G25081dcFAAAAAAAABAA  It really rocks!,0
Hmm Karma...It seems to work ok everywhere we check..,0
Check them out please  They're unsigned but really good  but they need for this video to go viral on the internet!,0
Oh god  what a stupifying host. Of course  this is the concept of the show  it's a showcase for Björk  and she chose to participate herself. BUT the host used those 5 minutes to make a stupid laugh of licking the iPad  not being able to turn it off  and an irrelevant superstitious about elves in the rocks. And here  for instance  Björk tries to explain that it is about a respectful relationship with nature - and he interrupts with some random gangster-respect-joke and doesn't let her finish... aaand interview over!,0
@Camilla: great cover! Thanks a lot for the link!,0
Björk has the floor 1:04-09  2:23-54  3:01-20  3:54-4:21  4:32-33  4:50-5:00 = 1 min 34 secs. That is around 30% of the clip. And yup  I'm slightly pissed :),0
Get over it  she usually doesn't say that much interesting stuff anyways...,0
Jon Sebastian Frederiksen  agreed  the host is a bit annoying. But Björk is as always funny and cool. Did you see the live-performance that comes after?,0
@gideon amos. Look at this.,0
it's @Gideon Amos by the way and thanks Will check on way home.,0
Oh is that how you do it? Well done x,0
When I play it  it says video not available in your location :-( I'm in th UK. No worries,0
Found on youtube :),0
So  the news is  that Roskilde Festival has teamed up with Apples and Björk  promoting Biophilia and iPad?,0
Martin: You've got that one very backwards. Roskilde Festival doesn't have anything to do with Björk's obsession with the iPad. The video is from a talkshow with Stephen Colbert  and doesn't have any relation to the festival either.  The fact is though that the album is partially written and recorded on that piece of hardware and it comes with a bunch of apps written specifically for the iPad. Like it or not.,0
I recommend that you people check out his show  Colbert is absolutely brilliant  and is currently leading one of the most effective protests against Citizens United (the decision that corporations are people and money equals speech). http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/405930/january-15-2012/colbert-super-pac-ad---attack-in-b-minor-for-strings,0
I know  but why it it nessesary for RF to mention the album and Ipad in the status message? I know this might not be intentionally  but it does create a doubt about the connection between RF  Blörk and Apple.,0
Martin Særmark-Thomsen  We can assure you - there is no hidden conspiracy between us  Björk  Apple  Colbert or anybody else. Come on  have a little faith - Björk is coming this summer  many people are happy about that and this is a fine little interview with her. That's it.,0
How can you call Colbert stupifying? It's an act - geez.,0
Martin: Because that is what the video is about. Android zealot much?,0
Roskilde Festival: I'm not in doubt  and don't think there's some kind of secret conspiracy. My pointe is  that when you mention the products in your status  it can give the wrong impression. You could have avioded that connection  simply by posting the link.,0
The description could probably have been rephrased to say  tablet  instead of  iPad   but ditching the description entirely is really a caveman approach of censoring product information out. I want to know what I am clicking before I click it.  Btw.  a parallel question: Let's imagine that Joe Strummer was still alive and the above video clip featured him and his trusty Telecaster. Would you still object to the guitar (the product) being mentioned in the description? It is after all an integral part of his musical oeuvre  similarly to the iPad's central role in Björk's new album.,0
I am selling a 1-day ticket for saturday,0
Is it still for sale? I would like to buy it then,0

Hi there  Now  I just read an article on Soundvenue about each act you've announced so far. In their article  they're saying that both Mew  Suspekt and Lamb of God are playing the Orange Stage  and that all of them are headliners.  So: Is there really going to be two Danish headliners? And will this reduce the number of said acts  or will we have more headliners than previously? I know that this number has been changed quite a few times and is not something that's chissled in stone  hence my question (also  could it be that maybe Soundvenue just got it wrong?)  Kind regards  Mikkel.  Ps. Yeah  I usually do this in your forum  but since it's been closed  here you go. Oh yeah  and will another forum be launched? A few of the guys in there mentioned they'd set up something  but I don't know if they got any further.,0
They don't know who's placed where on our poster. So let's just wait and see :-)  Someone's up to something with a new forum. We don't know how far they are exactly.,0
Alright  I thought so  just had to ask (and here's to hoping for Lamb of God on Arena  and a new forum ASAP) - thank you for your reply! :),0
Hey you awesome guys at the Roskilde Festival production!  I beg of you try and get Deorro booked for a performance at the Apollo stage this year. This guy is the leading Melbourne Bounce artist in the world  and he's super down to earth and awesome  I think he would be really good fit for the (small) electronic side of the Festival! Really hope take him into consideration! Kind regards from a Deorro and Roskilde fan,0
Lamb of God will play Roskilde Festival for the very first time in 2015. Here's a little taste of what to expect... ,23
One half of Blastbeast.dk on the hill with a camera  the other half in the pit <3 :),0
I'd like to see that happen at RF  ),0
Your  epic  crowd safety people like the ones you had in avalon this year stopping 50 kids in a moshpit to The psyke projekt and hellhorse  will surely ruin it again under Lamb of god...  We're are stopping The moshpit to prevent an accident  my ass. Learn something about metal concerts before The next festival. Call copenhell  wacken  graspop... Learn how NOT to fuck up a metal concert by pushing kids up against The fence  cause that was an disgrace. On saturday at major lazer  you let people do What ever....,0
Weren't we in that one  Mikkel Neubert?  ),0
Better-late-than-never response:  Thanks for all your comments and questions regarding safety. We will send all your info to our programmers and safety personnel - and we can ensure you that you will get a great experience at this specific concert.,0
wut? there were wall of death to almost every  wild  concert (even the electronic ones) xD no one got stopped..,0
crowdsurfing on the other hand...,0
I distinctly remember shows like The Dillinger Escape Plan in 2008  when the security persistently tried to stop both the band and the audience from having fun - even when said security was punched in the face by Greg Puciato AND Ben Weinman.  It's not a rare occurrence (in my experience at least) that they shuffle through the audience into the pit and try to stop it by standing in the middle or grabbing hold of some people in the pit and trying to remove them from the concert by force.  Maybe it's changed  and the security has been informed about what they should expect - and allow - at metal shows?,0
It's changed :) They will sometimes stand in the outskirts of the pit to make sure no one is injured. but they don't intervene.,0
Loïc from The Ocean even crowdsurfed multiple times without any intervention,0
Kreator had a massive Wall of Death at Roskilde in 2013.,0
Good to hear!,0
listen to this man^,0
Yes! Second that!,0
Im wondering.. Who was The boring one on The hill and who was in the pit?!?  ),0
Crowd surfing is not allowed...but if the artist tells people to do it the crowd safety wont stop it like at major lazer...had pits at deftones and Bdm aswell and noone interfiered...dunno what happend at psyke project,0
Throw the security into the pit if they try to stop it (y),0
 Kill the fucking panda ,0
Well.. Maybe Roskilde Festival could try to start a dialog... Because what I saw at Avalon at the Hellhorse/Pyske Project concert was retarded. The crowd safety  supervisors  looked like someone who sits at an office desk on a daily basis  and not someone who has a clue on whats what at a heavy metal concert. Ive been at Copenhell  a festival who has 5 years in the total  they know how to handle large pits  crowd surfing  circle pits and wall of deaths... Learn form Copenhell! Ive been at Roskilde 7 years. Only at shows like Slipknot ect  do Roskilde let people mosh and  release their energy in the fashion that metal is supposed to. When smaller acts play in the smaller tents  its sadly a different story. Please fix that! Let the metal concerts be metal concerts!,0
I can't handle moshpits. They aggravate me. Still  I know that's me and most people enjoy it and rarely anyone is hurt. That's why I just move a few rows back. Rock on!,0
Every single person who steps into a moshpit at a metal concert knows What it is. If you dont  then dont do it.,0
I went to the Hexis concert at Rising  and there were no problems there with the crowd safety people. The only time they stepped in was when the lead singer tried to crowdsurf.,0
Better late than never :-),0
I hope i wll get like this about AC/DC and Foo Fighters later :),0
But let people mosh :),0
Mads Wichmann Kristensen  that's the plan.,0

Big Moustache Bandits Teaser Single  Duty Free Man/Dirty Female  Available on February 22  www.bigmoustachebandits.be,0
how about shocking the world and bring  VCMG  to roskilde!!!!!!  ,0
Line up is for people who cant create their own party at Roskilde!,0
can you get a new lineup? cause it looks like that there is very few people that actually like or have even heard of any of the artists... very disapointing.,0
I suggest you listen to the artists that have been booked. Youll be surprised.,0
i dont like hipster music.. There is no electro music there  except for c2c and kraftwerk..,0
Alot of good bands and music coming  but where are the big names  the headliners? Seriously  I see one  and that's Rihanna :s,0
im disappointed  but that's probably my own fault for expecting too much. please tell me if you have another headliner up your sleeves! ,0
How  about bringing one of these?,0
You should definitely bring one of those. Just remember that you can only use it at the cooking areas - otherwise  you might set tents on fire  and we can't have that.,0
so where do i buy it?,0
that kicks ass!,0
New music this week?,0

Jørgensen (DK)  Dizzy Mizz Lizzy (DK)  Efterklang (DK)  Florence + The Machine (UK)  Gorillaz (UK)  Jack Johnson (US) Kashmir (DK)  Killswitch Engage (US)  Kings of Convenience (N) LCD Soundsystem (US)  Motörhead (UK)  Muse (UK) The National (US)  Nephew (DK)  Prince (US)  The Prodigy (UK) Robyn (S)  The Rumour Said Fire (DK)  Them Crooked Vultures (US)  Turboweekend (DK)  When Saints Go Machine (DK).... SERIOUSLY... do you even realize how many great bands there were that year? Why can't you make up a program like this again? I mean... come on.,0
Thank you for a very cool line up! F-in love Slipknot  Sigur Rós  QOTSA  BRMC and much more of this years festival. I am rock hound and all this rock and metal makes a happy pappy! Takk!,0
hopefully Gramatik will join the lineup http://www.facebook.com/gramatik,0
From the page you're linking to  it seems that he is in USA during Roskilde.,0
oh  damn. didn't notice that. -_-,0
Is RetRoBot playing in Roskilde? :D,0
New bands this week :) ?,0
Maybe. Where are you gonna camp this year?,0
Fresh thoughts from the bookers on this years line-up.  And if you want to dig deeper go to roskilde-festival.dk tomorrow at 12.00 (Friday at noon) and take part of the live Q&A with the Rikke Øxner,3
wtf happened to daft punk?... i was so sure...,0
Thank you for AIRBOURNE :),0
Watched it. Had to shut down. Disappointing. Embarassing. Not worthy. A few of the words that spring to mind. Admit it. You spent too much money on Rihanna. Now we are gonna sttle for junior league names.,0
Øxner out...,0
@Jørgen Huseby: How the hell could you be sure that Daft Punk would play?! If you know DP just a little  and maybe read a bit more about Them  you would know  why the rumours of them playing are so fucking retarded! But  the album is every Day worth waiting for!,0
I must admit that I was hoping for something else...I know that Kraftwerk is a major booking music wise  but it just doesn't appeal to me. There wasn't anything today that really got me excited. But I'm sure that I will have an awesome time anyway. :),0
Wont it be anymore bands?,0
I love Roskilde. Gave me MNy surprising experiences. But always with some major names to relate to. This year almodt everything is going to be a chance. That is NOT my Roskilde experience!,0
major skuffelse.... ok names  nice music... but a very dull  lame and non interesting line up that has been booked.... one could say its almost the first  radio friendly  roskilde festival i´ve seen in the 10 years of my rf experience.... nad thats not a good thing.... my 2000dkk plus expensives ara going for a NY trip instead..... thanks RF for a good ride... ps its time to get rid of the old people in the booking department,0
Dissapointed... were is Earl Sweatshirt? Were is Tyler  the creator with his new album?? I miss width and bigger names in the Hip-hop/rap area...,0
Muse will make the line-up complete!,0
all we need is muse,0
go fuck yourselfs roskilde!! worst line-up I ever seen!,0
Where is The Algorithm?? Where is a REAL headliner??,0
Fresh thought? Needs more bass!,0
This will be my sixth year  worst lineup so far.. :( I will have to go to Northside for music and Roskilde for the party and ppl :),0
http://www.downloadfestival.co.uk/line-up Where the fuck does the ticked money for Roskilde festival go. ONE DAY AT DOWNLOAD IS WAY BIGGER THAN THIS FOUR DAY PROGRAM. I have never been as disapointed on posterday because you guys added nothing.,0
It's not that bad  maybe it would have been interesting to see what they could have done with the money from not booking rihanna.,0
Was expecting some bigger hip hop names....a little dissapointing line-up this year. You clearly spent all of this years money on Rihanna  clearly not a good move considering there's a lot of dissapointed people...good luck next year!,0
@Frederik Juul Wilhardt You say Roskilde lack variety in the hip-hop names and then list two members from the same crew (Odd Future). As it is now you have:  Danny Brown  Joey BadaSS  El-P  Killer Mike  Action Bronson  Angel Haze  Azelia Banks  Flatbush Zombies  Mykki Blanco and Kendrick Lamar. There's PLENTY of variety there.  The hip-hop names ranges everything from 90's flavoured weed rap to socialy conscious rap to queer rap. To me that seem pretty varied.,0
Yeah i have to say that i am very disapointed in the lineup..this will be my first RF in10 years and i was looking forward to come from iceland when slipknot and queens of the stone age were booked..but what can i do..??? i have my ticked and all flights are booked  so im stuck with the worst lineup in many years :/,0
Really interesting bands on smaller letters. I think you´ve got a very good approach how to build a festival  keep it up. Those people complaining will be a lot happier after they´ve actually seen the bands. No Death Hawks on the poster  though.  ),0
I've already bought my ticket to my 10th Roskilde festival. But I must say this line up is the worst so far  I'm truly disappointed.,0
To all of you who does nothing but complain and write one or two sentences saying  fuck a shitty program  no good names  worst Line-up ever  I am not going etc etc .  Have any of you actually spent a few minutes thinking about how expensive live acts are now a days? Years ago when artists/bands had a lot of their income through record selling  concerts were cheaper than they are at present. Yes there are other festivals around the Globe that May have the bands You had hoped for. So if you are that dissapointed  go to another featival instead - nothing entangles you from doing that! But get this straight: You can never get all the big names You want at one festival with a budget of 40 million DKK. It is Hard to find a festival with that many bands/artists as Roskilde presents.  Furthermore: yes we are many that would have loved to see daft punk  RATM  TOOL  the Stones  Metallica  Rammstein and many others. But when You keep spamming / asking for those impossible one Way or the other both makes you look utterly stupid  is boring to read and surely sums up this: You have not used very many minutes researching the possibilities for those bands!  With the above being said i sincerely hope you all get a blast of a summer  at one festival or the other - or doing something completely else :),0
Just one question arises: What the hell were you thinking?,0
Ragnar: ppl can post whatever shit they want on a social media  and ppl can comment whatever they want. Just that  whatever like you did . ,0
Beta State's cover of Björks  unravel  - Give it a listen please  ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIdDblqeO_E&feature=g-all-s&context=G25081dcFAAAAAAAABAA,0
When are you announcing The Hives in the lineup?? ,0
Am up for playing an Acoustic set here  pm us or e:mail,0
OK that poster was a good joke  but now you can show us the real headliners for 2013....,0
When are you updating your app? Bær.,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoMLhnvV-yM I hope AC/DC will come next year to Roskilde :),0
Hey Roskilde. My camp and I have bought 2x10 tickets including 2x10x10 areas in N. We are of course interested in getting two areas next to each other. So now we wonder: do we need entrance booking  in order to get in as quickly as possible? Or when does the get a place area in N open?,0
The N area opens at the same time as all the other areas - Saturday 27 June at 16:00.  If you didn't choose entrance booking when buying your tickets  you won't be able to until May as we don't sell them as stand-alone tickets until then.,0
Oh well. Nevermind. We bought the entrance booking anyway :) but thanks! We'll be all ready at june 27th at 16.00 :),0
Hello  does anyone have a copy of the old RF 2014 Official playlist for Spotify. I miss it  have enjoyed listened to it everyday. Unfortunately it sudently dissapeared and has been replaced by the 2015 list. RF  please bring it back... Thanks,0

So many exciting names I've never heard of...,0
Nice that you already started a Spotify playlist for #RF15. Hope you do more to integrate with your own app in 2015. Would be nice if artists and track that I mark at favorite in Spotidy is linked to the Roskilde app so I don't need to check them of again in your app.,0

MEW? That's it. I'm on my way! Thank you!!,0
Paul Miric I might be tempted back next year!,0

Bring it on then! ??,0
Hey... Will tickets for all special camp options be available today or is it only 10x10?,0

Ticket is in 'da house...  Already looking forward to another paaarty,0
Hi Roskilde Crew. Let`s have some Post Rock Psyche Bands like Crippled Black Phoenix  End Of Green  Dioramic or Truckfighters. See you next year.,0
Louise Jensen køb billet (y),0
This is going to be 3 years of torture saving for the money to go back....,0
Hey Roskilde! What is the deal with 'Get a place'? Do you just buy a ticket for 'get a place-M' and that will allow you to camp in all the other letters that allow for 'get a place' tickets? Thank you!,0
I'll be there! For the 15th time!,0
Sadly I also have to pay the $2000 return flight from Australia and I just did that this year so it will be a while....,0
Good on you  Donna Holland. Coming all the way from Down Under. Love your country and all the people in it. Please bring more Aussies with you to Roskilde Festival  -),0

It's U2. They just released their plans of a 2015 tour yesterday and RF wouldn't go out this early unless it's as big as that.,0
Wtf you want u2 at RF for? They must be the world's most boring band. Get some Heavy rock/Metal going!,0
Black Sabbath or Robert Plant and his sensational Space Shifters ( Plant was fantastic on Glastonbury this year ) :-),0
Please be U2. (Then there's no way they'll take up space at Glastonbury).,0
We'll get back to you about this soon.,0

D'Angelo?! :),0
Blood Red Shoes :D?,0

The 420 Funk Mob  the off days project fronted by long time Parliament/Funkadelic Front Man Mike Clip Payne  that features a revolving cast of current and former members of Pfunk along with an all star cast of support musicians from touring national acts    Clips takes the idea of changing around the set list one step further.

Here is a review of the last show 420 Funk Mob did on December 12th in New York City    What began as a side trip for Parliament-Funkadelic’s Michael “Clip” Payne has evolved into one of the most versatile jam bands around  a Family Stone-meets-The-Dead vehicle that frees your mind -- so that your ass  of course  can follow. Some of the finest original funk this side of Sly Stone  Larry Graham and the Godfather of Soul. The 420 Funk Mob melds that sound with some Sixties psychedelia  a bit of Sun Ra  arkestration   and even a little soft rock  performed by a revolving cast of former P-Funk members and masterful musician friends. Jam after jam  style after style  they sync up. One collective under a frequently hypnotic groove  Jerry Demarco Cliffviewpilot.com    Here are some links to check out.

I saw Slash support AC/DC in Paris 2 years ago and i was also there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaYmeSg_yPw,0
oh god! I saw him live at the quart festival back in 2009! With Ozzy  Ronnie wood  Jason bonham  John 5  fergie! it was freakin awsome!,0
http://www.rocknytt.net/festival/4281-queen-headlinar-sonisphere-uk Maybe to Roskilde also ?,0
Without Freddie Mercury  it's not Queen!,0
Still good songs that deserve to be played. Queen+Paul Rodgers worked very well. Would be a cool way to finish off the festival sunday evening!,0
Check out more live music from last year's Pavilion Junior stage on our web-TV.   Last chance to request bands for this year's Pavilion Junior is Sunday 5 February  so follow this link and request right away: http://roskilde-festival.dk/index.php?id=4011  Who would you like to see this summer?,3
The Faroese hip hop group Swangah Dangah!!,0
DAD  Steel Panther  Huldre  Traphiklys  and Metallica  please,0
Babylove and the van dangoes,0
Honningbarna is coming. The Eclectic Moniker should be there. We'll check up on it!,0
This is head  was awesome last year,0
Hammonds  Harrington & Destroy isn't there either,0
How about Jarle Bernhoft?!,0
Søren Helmersen: They already played Roskilde once  albeit on one of the biggeer stages. That makes them inelegible for the Pavilion Junior stage. They could play a bigger stage this year though  seeing as they have a new album coming out in the coming couple of months.,0
Gather your friends and buy your Roskilde tickets early to get your very own 10x10 m camping area  located in area N.  Ticket sale starts on Tuesday! More info: http://roskil.de/rf15start,22
But we want to be in C! :'(,0
This current management really tear up all the traditions  and I think that´s a very big problem for Roskilde Festival.  This is the 3rd or 4th tradition that they´ve got rid of..,0
Camping area? Looks more like a refugee camp.,0
Frederik LarsenTobias Boe ThomsenEmil Stengaard OlsenSebastian T TjæreborgJakob BakkeLasse JørgensenTheis Jendal,0
Can we get  C113 or C104 (2014)?,0
Debora Cruz  we're pretty sure it's more fun at our place than in a refugee camp.,0
Stefan Thorsvang Petersen  you help the festival by buying early. Therefore  we'd like to honour those early birds. Plus  Get A Place N is just a smaller area and not the most central. You still have lots of space to run for if that's what you like.,0
About 170 of them  yup.,0
Emil Mikkelsen  this offer for area N is only valid when you buy 10 tickets in one purchase.  Get A Place in area M is available for purchase.,0
or maybe its the refugee camp that looks like the camping area :O,0
Mötley Crue will play Hellfest in France  please book them also to Roskilde :),0
lets just say if you just manage to get ONE of the bands playing mighty  Hellfest this year I would be more than happy! Best EU-festival program of 2012!,0
There are three already: Refused  Nasum and DevilDriver :) But yeah I agree  that line-up is INSANE.,0
A very talented lass from Newcastle whose first CD comes out next week. Please get her on a plane to Denmark this summer!,0
I can't find the option to pay for the get a tent option. Can I get some help please? :),0
It's an option to buy ekstra. It's there. First the ticket then the GAT.,0
Thank you for your time and help Peter :),0

You keep saying that sales start tuesday. But I haven't been able to see what time it starts at. And why not announce prices already now. Some people might want to gather funding from friends if they want to get 10x10 or get-a-place. Is it because you feel that the 2015 prices will be discouraging?,0
Ups sorry. Found the starting time 10.00. But what about prices - what is the reason behind not wanting to tell us in advance?,0
Mark Ronson And The Business International!!!!,0
roskilde.... please add The Exploding Boy (Official) to the junior pavilion!!!  with The Cure already playing the orange stage  it only seems fitting to add stockholm  sweden's  the exploding boy  who is named after a cure b-side!!!  it would be a amazing to see both bands in one festival!!! ,0
It's funny that you hype Cerebral Ballzy as an anti-hipster dose to the line-up  when they seem more like hipster kids who raided their local Goodwill store and are more in love with the image of being hardcore kids from the late-'80s than actually worrying about playing good music (sorta like Trash Talk). ,0
Come on - Dangers of the sea ,0

I'm really sad that you can no longer get a RF t-shirt with the music lineup  as in the traditional festival style. I still have a t-shirt from my first RF in 2006  and when I look at the brandnames it takes me back to those great koncerts. How come there isn't a single t-shirt with the lineup? A great idea would be if you could pre-order a t-shirt with your top bands on it.,0

Why do they book all this rock... what about the alternative scene roskilde??? where´s the love (qoute B.E.P),0
Love that number  but what the fuck man!? Don't get people so excited and thinking about SOAD  Rage or epic shit like that  when all you're booking is some old ass rockband who only 30% of the festival knows of... Come on  step it up for fucks sake!,0

Hi. A bunch of questions: 1. What is the ticket price in 2015? 2. If you buy 20 tickets can you then get 2x10x10 m area together in the N area? Or if you buy 15 tickets get 15x15 m area? 3. Is the N get a place the area where people  line for east 2 entrance?,0
How many gates will be at the West next year ?,0
Hi Roskilde Festival. How are the rules in get a place? Can you bring other people in to your camp? Or is it a restricted area?,0
We start the ticket sale for Roskilde 2015 on Tuesday.

This lot say they're  the perfect combination of the two best types of rock'n'roll that exists today   but we think they're doing themselves something of a disservice. The Blame Game is a beast of a ballad  a sweeping epic that actually contains at least five different kinds of rock'n'roll. Or maybe six. We lost count. Either way  it's a glorious great big noise  and we like it. - Classic Rock Magazine,0

Queens of the stone age,0
when is Roskilde festival?its looks good,0
Rihanna is one of the biggest popstars in the world. Thats why. I dont like her either but I do understand why she is headlining.,0
Didn't read - LOL! Useless post! ,0
Black rebel motorcycle club Queens of the stone age Slipknot Turbonegro Airbourne Suicidal tendencies Chelsea light moving Kraftwerk Volbeat Kreator The Sword Fan-fucking-tastic !!!!!,0
bullet for my fucking valentine,0
Thank you Roskilde! Nice video and even more good names & big surprises! Cant wait until summer!,0
Hope you enjoyed the stream. Here's the poster,580
Is this the final lineup?,0
You forgot to put David Bowie on your poster!,0
Slipknot! :D,0
how dare u place Anaal Nathrakh down there in the small ones >.<,0
that wasnt a stream? Just a video :),0
It was ag Nice way to do it :) really happy about the Line up aswell!!!,0
stream was great just wished there were some more exciting big acts,0
Question: How come you have such amazing footage of numerous Roskilde gigs  yet none of it is available on Youtube?,0
Come OOON! - get the site back up!,0
I too think that you forgot to announce some  top-of-poster  names...well  at least  I hope you forgot,0
The rain in 2007 was better than this years program,0
is rihanna the head name ? or comes it later ?,0
Best lineup in recent years. Thanks a bunch!,0
Where is Daft Punk?,0
when will you release the good acts? :),0
Looks like we will be having a great time this year as well! :),0
Really good line-up. Great music all round. But I am missing some headliners... :-),0
You need to be either deaf or really fuckin stupid if you dont see at least 25-30 great bands/artists in this poster.,0
A good number of bands that should be great there. But damn  some weak headliners...,0
how about Rancid  The Transplants and Dropkick Murphys?!,0
Much much better than last year,0
get your shit together guys! this is shit  where is david bowie  enimem  daft punk??? get some legendary music! roskilde haven't been the same since prince played,0
Okay did ANYONE at least call Tyler  Frank or Daft?,0
For the price it's really not fantastic...,0
Thank you for AIRBOURNE :),0
Where is Frank Ocean?,0
Some interesting acts  but thw big ones suck.. Daft Punk or just something that would be a major draw for those over 20 yr. old.. Rihanna is for the teen fair enough.. But there is definately huge shortcomings  and its looks like she has cost 1/3 of the budget and the draw was minimal.. What a shame..,0
The worst lineup I`ve ever seen! And I`ve been to Roskilde Festival 17 years in a row.,0
Only 4-5 artists who can play orange.. Weak headliners!,0
i love Roskilde  but i'll give this year a miss. My 10th Roskilde should be something special  ),0
Thank you  Roskilde! THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU!,0
The National as a headliner...,0
\ m /,0
Rihanna really fucked up the budget it seems,0
Great line-up. And you guys are ignorant fucks  maybe you should listen to something else than what is topping the charts today  then you'd know how brilliant the line-up really is.,0
It sucked,0
love it!,0
This is fucking shit. Worst lineup ever.,0
Some cool shit came up  which i didn't expect. But from all i expected (seeing the gaps in their tourdates) not a single one is in - makes it all in all a bit disappointing. Good that music isn't the most important in Roskilde at all,0
Share your thoughts on the line-up. Surprises and disapointments - all is welcome.,0
There is an incosistency between the poster and the list on the website.. On the Poster  Kaka (DK) is named under Pav Jun/Apollo C  while he is mentioned in the big  standard band  list on the site  and not under Pav Jun/Apollo C...,0
The lineup was better prior to this poster release  you should've just not released more bands... Also  it's like Roskilde Festival is trying to win a competition in getting bands that no one ever heard about ever.,0
Aint a festival about discovering new bands  artists  and music in general. Stop bitching about the lack of headliners  and start getting to know music outside of your comfortzone! Looking forward to 29th of june! Biggup,0
The lineup itself is ok if you would pay half the ticket price. But it's too thin for a major festival. Very dissapointed.,0
Where are Pixies ??,0
All crap  where is Muse  Rammstein  Ironmaiden or just another big name???,0
this is a proper lineup: http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/history/2010/bands/,0
Where are the THE KNIFE!!!!,0
I didn't.. where is Green Day  they plays the same week i mean really? Come On!,0
7 headliners. One big stage  4 days  2 of 7 only need Arena. This is a huge dissapointment. Did Rihanna grab the purse and run?,0
worst line-up ever! wouldn't even come to this if it was free lol shame on whoever organised this.,0
Don't know what's more disappointing  the line up or the fact I already booked my flight!!!!!,0
so sad..,0
AROUND THE WORLD?? I'm still hoping to see my mechanical friends.,0
Srsly sad ''improvement''... Soooooooooo sad. You had every chance to do the best line-up in 8 years. But no Ben Howard  Major Lazer  Frank Ocean and so on... Not good enough RF!!,0
Fantastisk lineup! :D,0
No  it started up so good  but now. No it's bad!,0
roskilde wants to have daft punk there  and they have tried to book them  but they hav not even got a hold of them.. they are fucking gods... they play their own game..,0
The stream was class!,0
Great line-up!,0
line up=weird as ..,0
Volbeat   Kraftwerk og Queen of the stone age ganske fede navne,0
One thing is Daft Punk  but I was really hoping for Rodriguez and Parov Stelar..  They're smaller acts  touring and in the area..,0
Where the F*** is Frank Ocean??,0
I'm going as always. But why do you make such a fuzz about revealing the poster  when you don't bring a headliner? Headliner is meant as a headliner on your poster... But big thumps up for bringing BRMC though.,0
Sorry-you will miss me this year -),0
Wow.. how many times have volbeat  slipknot and efterklang been at RF now? Almost thought you would book Björk again too.,0
Well  I am excited and look forward to my 3 year anniversary :),0
Sucky line-up but hopefully I will be proven wrong!  Men ja at man bruger the national som hovednavn er sku lidt tyndt..,0
Not a single headliner in the big release? Strange... Maybe they still got an ace up their sleeve.,0
Where is Frank Ocean?????,0
Have tried to convince everybody that Rihanna off course hadnt been so expensive. But apparently she is.....,0
LOVE IT! <3 Henry Rollins <3 Ensiferum <3 KRAFTWERK <3 so much more <3,0
Jesus fucking christ.... I thought that Roskilde was one of the biggest festivals in the world. Slipknot is the only huge band !!!! Next time I will go to download or rock wherchter... The management has destroyed this festival,0
For fuck sake! Don't be disappointed!! KAKA is on the program!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZXaU4VMGLg,0
ICE-FUCKING-AGE THANK  YOOOOOOU  also thank you loads for Suicidal  Turbonegro  Ondatropica (OMG YES AWESOME) and Airbourne!40 acts in all i'm excited to see!,0
and when do you announce the headliners?,0
It is right  could be loads better.,0
Why no Radiohead mumford and sons Gorillaz or muse?? need more British bands.,0
Rumor has it that Roskidle used one fourth of their budget on the marketings company that decided they needed to get #rf13 trending on twitter and make a 45 minute long video that nobody really wanted to watch,0
Lorte line-up  seriøst,0
Come on guys! Stop the whining. Once again Roskilde has booked superb set of quality acts. The only thing missing would be a really big name to add to the headliner. Without it would be great festival anyway. But my hopes goes to that Roskilde has one ace up it sleeves yet to be revealed  that could make the program a contender to the 2009 program.,0
HENRY ROLLINS FUCK YEEEEEAAH! best thing that has happened this year by far!,0
disappointed by two things: 1. wheres bikstok? 2. why the eff is volbeat a headliner?,0
How could you let me down?! I trusted you Roskilde! ,0
Why would you have a big live stream of final acts and none of them be headlines? #anticlimax,0
2011 was the year  it's meeeh really good headliners but not somuch my thing except for QOTSA,0
Crap!! Get Back to basics!,0
How very  very disappointing!,0
I learnt last year that Roskilde isnt about the music... its about the festival with a bit of music for added entertainment... stay dry guys  bring your own antibacterial hand wash and have fun!,0
The setup gets worse and worse every year.,0
Which day is Rihanna playing? Can't seem to be able to find out that info...,0
I'm glad that i bought ticket to Hurricane Festival instead of roskilde festival this year!,0
One day Roskilde Festival will understand how much i love them and build me an expressway directly from Brasil to the festival Campsite.,0
Rihanna comes?Ok so i don´t wanna come too much stupid teenies because of her!,0
Not good.....,0
20 years in a row  seems like this is my last one  tighten up Øxner. ,0
I must say Im disseponted. Ive been to this lovely festival for 11-years in a row. But I wount be going this year. The lineup suck  its the worst ever for any festival. I meen Rihanna wtf??  Bring the boss back insteed.  Roskilde R.I.P,0
Christ fuck a shirty line-up...i mean damn...considdering they kept telling to calm down as half the names where missing and then they this shit,0
When you splash 2/3 of your budget on Rihanna and can't afford real headliners as a result  you've got to do go with a plan-B and promote bands that would be subliners *at best* in any other setting  ) How people *still* think this line-up is worth one of the most expensive festival tickets in Europe is baffling...  Reading/Leeds Festivals cost about the same  and look at that line-up! (http://www.readingfestival.com/tickets/weekend-tickets) Just the headliners (ACTUAL headliners): Green Day  Eminem  Biffy Clyro  System of a Down  Nine Inch Nails  Deftones  Skrillex & Fall Out Boy. Jesus. And don't try the argument  yeah  but there's so many more bands at RF  - no  there aren't! And Reading/Leeds is just one of many examples.  I think sadly Roskilde Festival has lost a significant portion of market to NorthSide & Copenhell  who book intelligently and charge much less (smaller festivals  of course  but still)  and over the past few years the RF line-up has looked more like grasping at straws than a serious attempt at remaining one of the leading festivals in Europe. It simply isn't  and probably never will be again.  All they've got left is the Orange Feeling  and even that has become something else. The campsite looks (and sounds) like Sunny Beach / Lloret de Mar / Ibiza and a lot of the younger audience are now treating the festival as some kind of  anything goes  experience rather than the big collective celebration it used to be.  Grumble grumble.  N.B. Prepare for  Harlem Shake  blasting from every camp ~25 times a day this year  )  N.B.2. Although I am dissatisfied with the weakness of the big names this year (QOTSA & Kraftwerk excluded)  I'll still be there for Kvelertak  Dillinger Escape Plan  The Sword & Uncle Acid!,0
I am very dissapointed.. Om still going but the Lineup is the worst u Ever come up with. Rock n roll ??? Rock n roll ??? Rock n roll???  what about some Classic rock n roll,0
jamen northside it is,0
There's just enough room for Rage against the machine above Kraftwerk and National if you count the letters. Coincidence?  ),0
Today at 12.00 we have a Q&A session at roskilde-festival.dk where you can ask our music booker Rikke Øxner all about the line-up tweet and use hashtag #rf13,0
Simply had to c/p my comment from another post:,0
yes  I did. but only because I play some other festivals with my band at that time and I'm not able to go to Roskilde... this line-up is a joke,0
Peter Klausen.. You miss the point.. I listen to everything  but there are obvious choices and bands  who are touring and should have been booked  both big and small.. Instead they try to draw people with Rihanna using a big cut of the budget. a big and very clear mistake. Roskilde has just become a very mediocre plane dane sort of festival  and can't compete with the biggest like they once could  even though they have the best spenders of money  its very sad  but its by their own doing...,0
Where is Devil's Coach Hoarse?????????????????????,0
Worst headliners in YEARS. lots of minor brilliant bands no doubt  but for almost 2000 kroner you better bring in some heavy guns.  Where's the Iron Maiden/Prince/Bruce Springsteen/Gorillaz/Muse - size names that are befitting of the legendary Orange Stage?  I see a repeat of the Mastodon concert where 8 people and 2 cats showed up at Orange Stage more or less..,0
In my opinion an okay line-up. Some bands that I wanna see  a ton of bands I have no clue who they are and not really interested in seeing. But I don't really go there for the music  more for the atmosphere  orange feeling and party. Though I am disappointed  because I was so hoping for Mumford and Sons and Daft Punk. But I'll keep hoping until the summer. Biggest mistake I would say is Rihanna. She's a crappy mainstream musician that probably cost a third of the budget. Not worth it.. anyways see u in june!,0
Hi Rikke Anne Nielsen. This is test. How many names do you know of this list?,0
Oh dear  Andrea Hahmann  not as many as I did some years ago... around 15 :-),0
Missing Rammstein and Skunk Anansie......but gr8,0

Is the map of the camping-area comming any time soon?,0
Yes  very soon!,0
How does the clean and silent entry work? Is it just a ticket to get there at the start? Can you arrive later and camp in clean and silent without that ticket?,0
Yes  it's an option to get into the Silent & Clean area before midnight on saturday the 25th. After midnight the area opens to everyone  so yes  technically it is completely possible to camp there later in the week  provided that the area isn't completely filled up.,0
Attention  metal fans. MetalSucks.net has collected some recommendations as inspiration for your Roskilde requests.  Submit your requests here and enter the draw for 3x2 #rf15 tickets: http://roskil.de/rf15requests (remember to turn off your AdBlock  if you have it)  Here's their message:   Part of what makes Roskilde so great is how open-minded the festivalgoers are to all kinds of music. Curiosity and the urge to discover something new are in the air — wander by one of the festival’s many stages during some down-time and you just might stumble upon a band you’ve never heard of before that’ll blow you away. With that in mind  here are a few of my personal favorite “up and coming” metal acts  all generating serious buzz in the worldwide metal scene — with a few seasoned veterans thrown in too for good measure — that I think the crowds at Roskilde will be receptive to. ,3

*hoping for Metallica or Tenacious D tomorrow...or something else that I like a lot!*,0
Hey Roskilde... How can it be that DR mostly makes articles about Northsides music announcements  and not Roskildes? I personally think you've got a great line-up so far this year :),0
https://www.facebook.com/266327946760944/photos/a.274109732649432.64549.266327946760944/755784897815244/?type=1&theater Good News. I hope they will play Roskilde in 2015 :),0
When do you start the ticket sale for next summer? Will it be like some previous years that you can buy it for last years price at first or smthn?,0
It shouldn't be too long. The price remains the same from start till finish.,0

Radiohead's tour: 3. July - Bologna (Italy) 4. July - Udine (Italy) 5. July - Free (Possible slot for Roskilde) The Cure will play thursday 5th of july. I don t think we will get 2 headliners at Orange at the same day. I don t think we will get them. 6. July - Berlin (Germany) 7. July - Berlin (Germany) 8. July - Free (Possible slot for Roskilde) 9. July - Switzerland 10. July - France 11. July - France,0
I don t think they will come  they have to have also day off on the tour,0
Will they bring their own stagelights on 10 big trucks again  and at the same time preach selfrighteously about saving energy??? sorry  couldnt help it  but it was rather ironic in '07.,0
I thought Radohead show in 2008 was boring but that is just me. I like more Radiohead in the 90 s,0
Everything after OK Computer is fantastic.  No  correct me.. Everything Radiohead ever made is fantastic. Maybe except Pablo Honey.. Haha,0

Eric Clapton and His Band that included Phil Collins on drums played at Roskilde Festival in ’86.  Here’s Clapton & Collins side-by-side,2
I can not wait to see the teaser :),0
We know this isn’t the sexiest topic  but garbage is an ongoing challenge at Roskilde Festival. Please give us your best ideas as to how we can make cleaning up after yourself a natural part of the festival experience? ,3
have certain music you play for an allover clean up dash throughout the festival. after a few drinks everyone will love it! or a station set up where if you bring a certain number of bags full of rubbish you get a free drink card or something. awful that you have to  bribe  people but would work.,0
Just get out there  and pick up the bags before the refund collectors get to them..  Where i lived this year we saw the trash truck twice..,0
More bins?,0
Translated: Trash cans everywhere... So that you don't have to go more than max 100 meters to get rid of your garbage. Surely there must be more people who would like their own camp clean  if it is very  very easy to clean it up :),0
Go tjek out Thefuntheory.com  Deep bins may only be a part of the solution  but the whole idea is to make a game out of everything - even getting rid of your trash properly.,0
But if RF was to make a game out of it  it might only be entertaining to drunk people for 2-3 days... But every little help would be great  ),0
Put up a hole lot of dustbins  that there are easy to empty for the beautiful Orange woorkers :D,0
Don't let whole families who treat their kids like slaves to scour at you and grab your drinks from your hands. Employ more garbage pickets. These families are nothing but slave drivers. OUTLAW FESTIVAL GARBAGE SLAVERY. ,0
Thank for all the good ideas already. Please keep them coming. More garbage bins is actually one of the things we are looking into for this year's festival. Nice idea of bringing more fun into the trash collection. How can this be something people themselves introduce to the cleaning up?,0
Is this a teaser for tomorrow?  )  Garbage has an album in the works  so my bet is on them :P,0
Fill up stupid gravel pit with rubbish so we can get some camping area back!!! No seriously I think more rubbish bins is the best answer  ),0
The first step should be to make sure that the garbage people actually do collect gets picked up. That was definetly not the case last year.,0
Well you had it a while back that one could collect kg of trash and get something back as a recycle return. How about you get something like a beercoupon for every 5 kgs of trash or something. :-),0
just put up trash cans... all over the place,0
Nice idea to have garbage bins that glove in the dark. When it comes to the idea of given beers for collecting trash  as we tried some years ago  we want it to be natural part of being at the festival that you collect your garbage and not something you are rewarded for. Thank for all the idea  please keep them coming.,0
Garbage is fun  keep the garbage!!!,0
Garbage bags with a refund which are handed out when You get Your ticket. They should have a refund that You get when the festival is over and a filled bag is delivered to the refund center  say DKK 100?,0
Björk to be confirmed in 2012 ?,0

Together with H&M we want to focus on a more sustainable approach to fashion. 95% of all tossed out clothes can be used again – visit H&M in Trade Zone and make sure your fashion doesn’t go to waste.  You can recycle it or give old  worn-out clothes new life in H&M’s Design Lab. Five designers are ready to help you. Don’t forget to drink a glass of organic cava in the rooftop bar afterwards.,34
Will they be using child labor at roskilde as well.. or did they think we forgot?,0

Caroline  let me underline that it's not a popularity contest. You can request the bands you think deserve more recognition  and we use it as an input in our work finding some of the fresh sounds out there. But the ones with most requests don't get to play - it doesn't work like that. I hope that makes sense.,0
Robin  since it's a stage for upcoming talent from the Nordic countries  I'd say that your aim is off.,0
Yeah night fever was fucking great ! And in may this year we have them on stage in lübeck !,0

Mette thinks we should donate money to an urban garden on the empty lot where Ungdomshuset (youth centre) used to be.  Who would you support? Submit your idea here (deadline is on Sunday): http://po.st/rf14yourdonations,15
please do this!!,0
A-G-U-R-K-E-T-I-D,0
I thought when it was destroyed  a few years ago  it was because there was a project for a new building. Can't believe it remained empty all this time :-/,0
I'm done with Roskilde Festival if you donate money to anything connected to Jagtvej 69.   An urban project would be cool though. But not on that adress.,0
Its a fantastic idea!,0
And btw Dennis Farcinsen Leth... Too bad for you. I bet if a band you like visits roskilde you will come anyway  -),0
It would be silly to donate money to an illegal project .. Its a wonderful project  but never the less illegal atm ..,0
Be aware of the political massage the festival will send by supporting this......,0
http://www.veteranhaven.dk/  A fantastic project to help our veteran soldiers who are struggling with PTSD after being sent to warzones around the world on peace keeping missions,0
For sure donate to it   Jagtvej 69 represents anyone alive in Norrebro during the 90's   special place with a lot of memories for all .pathetic they had to pull it down just to leave air   infact if Roskilde Festival want to get some huge Kudos they should buy it and turn it into a squat :),0
jada. And calm down. Roskilde made a  copy  of Jagtvej 69 at Roskilde 2007. So you shouldn't have went to the festival since... diversity YES <3 <3 (and yes it is still just an example of an submission),0
You should buy NV Auto Park! It's a small  cozy lot on provstevej/theklavej  Copenhagen NV - somebody has planned building some big ugly building and thereby robbing us of one of our few green areas! More info about the park: https://da-dk.facebook.com/pages/NV-Auto-Park/91472229562,0
Cute idea with Byhave 69. Yes its been the Site of controversy! But keep it in your mind and let go......  or it will ruin your / our future. As such making it into a garden could just make a statement. And NOT nourish or clinging to a badass past. Roskilde is about that too ...,0
NO!,0
I've never supported Ungdomshuset. But the location have High potential. No one says that it should be related with earlier project on the adress. Use the location to something! Its central and in a popular area,0
i am enig,0
Can't you just buy the land? Then...Vertical garden!,0
This empty space can be beautiful once again,0
You could pay our practice room rent. In advance  we will play for free next year!,0
How that place was ever named  Ungdomshuset  is beyond me. Youth Centre is just even more wrong as it indicates a place for youths to go. However  the only youth about it  was the police-fighting--grafitti-painting-rebel kind of youth  which is not a pleasant community for anyone else than those involved with it.   Thus  calling it Ungdomshuset (Youth Centre) is an abomination.  Though  it would be nice with a garden of some kind instead.,0
So because some of them were guilty of violence and vandalism  they should ALL be considered the same and judged as thus  and the ground be kept empty forever? God forbid something could or would grow in that place  and with it  maybe inspire a sense of peace and serenity  as well as a growing hope for the future.,0
NO....!,0
I think we can help: https://www.facebook.com/groups/492946427422037/photos/,0
Great idea  Mette. Maybe this could be a garden with music,0
Just do it!!!,0
The members of JA-Kontoret Helsingør are trying hard to make a Youth Centre in Helsingør  but we need a building  and buildings cost money :l,0
Yo! Some friends and I (from the MC-Camp) are organising a Roskilde Decompression. We NEED to have Dixie Burgers. Could you put us in touch with the people in charge of the Dixie Burger stand so that we can get the recipe?,0
Sorry  but we simply need to complain a bit.  So we know what's the absolutly number one thing that makes Roskilde concerts so special: YOU - the world's best audience. We even got a price for that (check the pic. The artists apparently love you) So you are nice people. That's fine. That's cool.  BUT SERIOUSLY! Could we please have more complaining about the line-up or just the festival in general? Please. We are all jacked into the social media at the moment  and we need something to work with. You are way too positive  and have been for the last months. More yelling and bitterness please...or has the sun softened you up?,21
We don't care about Rihanna! Give us Frank Ocean and Daft Punk!,0
WE NEED DAFT PUNK FOR FUCK SAKE!,0
I WANT DEFTONES OR I WILL KILL SOMEBODY!!!!!!!!!!,0
Why isn't Daft Punk on the line-up?,0
MORE EXPENSIVE POLKA BANDS,0
We're coming from Canada for this - excited for full line-up reveal  and for what we're sure will be a wicked experience!,0
think they're ironic...but the truth is  that the line-up sucks...,0
So if you guys love the fans  and the artists love the fans  and the festival is made for the fans... why won't you listen to what the fans want to see from the line-up?  The whole  You choose the bands  we get them to play  charade is wearing a bit thin and people are seeing straight through it.,0
You've got some good metal artists this year BUT NOT ENOUGH! In general  Roskilde Festival have turned into this hipster-infested rave party with waaaay to much electronic shit  and waaaaay to many drugs. You are loosing your original audience  and replacing them with said hipsters and crackheads. I know you need to make money  but you've sold out. I am going to W:O:A this year  as i did last year  and probably will do many years from now unless something drastic happens to Roskilde Festival.,0
You´re taking all my money and giving it to good cause and all I get is 200 great concerts and the best week of my year and a really wide smile... Damn you!!,0
Less mud!  Fat Freddy's Drop James Blake Analogik Woodkid,0
Roskilde  you have a shite booker  simple as that. Bring back Leif !! So much great upcoming RNR  but you book oldies and djs  and mindless popacts.. Other than that  there a shitload of great artists touring that you have'nt got  who really should be self-written for the bill.. New booker  new booker  new booker.. She has taste like a donkeys ass..,0
NEED BETTER SECURITY IN THE CAMPSITES. We don't want to be policed  but there are less volunteers than there were in 2006  and less watchtowers  too many dark areas  and too many thefts. Need more volunteer patrols and more watchtowers  2006 had the best balance I can remember.,0
Focus a little less on the  they just released a new album -factor and more on the great performers. And you need to bring both Coldplay and Muse back one of these years. They were too good to not book again.  (Also COYB is a must),0
Whoever wrote this update needs an english-lesson.,0

If we're so nice they would probably come! WHeres David Guetta  wheres Metallica? Wheres Ellie Guldinng Wheres Zedd Dead  wheres NetSky! Not mentioning Justice  Madeon og saaa videre!,0
Borgore? Feed Me??? FFS.... Come on Roskilde... <3,0
We're coming from Scotland! give us a little more british acts pleeease,0
Book Ben Howard  Chase & Status  The Killers  Mumford & Sons  MØ  Daft Punk  Eminem  SOAD  Major Lazer  The Weeknd  The xx  Frank Ocean  or I´ll complain SOOOOOO bad in about 4 hours! Until then Im pretty happy though... Sorry? :S,0
I haven't been excited about the line'up since 2008! How come a new festival as Northside can create the most amazing line'up and you guys have NOTHING!! The only reason I go to Roskilde is because of the camping/drinking  which still blows my mind! Alt-J  Frank Ocean  Daft Punk and Tylor the creator at Roskilde  PLEASE!,0
I like your cockiness - you must really have something up your sleeves,0
It's a bit hard to judge (and hence complain) when you haven't released the complete line-up yet  that being said - WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SPEND MONEY ON RIHANNA!? Can I pay less if I promise not to join all the 14 year olds for the playback session of crappy radio hits that you so happily paid for? I love Roskilde  but a very large part of that love is for the people attending and the vibe created by the audience  not your crappy planning skills or money waste. For starters - stop promising Tuborg (Carlsberg) a monopoly on beer that also includes stringent rules on what you can and cannot bring into the festival grounds and then pass it off with lame-ass security excuses.,0
You want bitterness? You got. I've attenden Roskilde 6 years in a row  my first in 2006. I've loved it more than anything. But not anymore.. I didn't go last year and I won't be going this year. Why? The music. The only bands interesting on the program this year  I've already seen (most of'em at Roskilde). I've been going beacuse of the music  but the past two years  I think the program sucked. I'll be going to Northside this year. Yes  it's cheaper and closer to home  but none of that matters. What matters is the music  and THEY defently got the program to deliver  what Roskilde failed to (for me  at least). The Knife  Portishead  The Flaming Lips  Trentemøller  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds  When Saints Go machine  Ellie Goulding  Arctic Monkeys and the list goes on,0
I'm literally fleeing a war torn country to get to your festival and you have the common decency to make me wait FOUR MORE HOURS?,0
Guess this will be a strange complaint  but.. it would have been my 9th year at roskilde festival this year  if I had wanted to. Thing is  I don't. Roskilde festival is a bit like eating cake  and after having eaten cake for 8 days you pretty much don't want any more. Hell  I was full on the 3rd day last year and felt like I was force feeding myself the last days. I am still so full with cake that I will stay home this year. It's just too much. I'm not even sure I ever want to have cake again. Yeah  and I'm not really that positive about the music either  but I guess that's ok by me since most of my heroes died at 27.,0
Great thread! Just got convinced to pick northside instead  ),0
just book Dear Sasquatch and everyone will be satisfied. Apollo Jr that is.,0
Sure  you won't listen to your crowd.. And as far as I can tell  nobody is coming for the music or the stripper from barbados  they come for the atmosphere. We need more bands who would be excited to play for a excited audience instead of  acts throwing  the routine . We need more rock that is not in their dying years  its clear that your bookers ignore that genre og don't listen to it and listen to radio a bit too much.. Look at download and rock am ring and glastonbury.. They've got it down when it comes to combining new and big acts.. Again  Bring back Leif.. For the past 6 years you've proven that you miss the mark with your bookings  in any case far more than you hit it.. Thats an objective fuckin' fact.. You try to kill it  but rock will never die..,0
No Soul or r&b or funk. Wtf.,0
Some more Irish folk/celtic music with a lot of violins,0
More rock  and this means not more metal.,0
Add Opeth to the lineup  and some more toiletpaper at the shitters! Other than that you're doing great!!,0
Book Tom Waits  how hard can it be…,0
What you need is SELF-CRITICISM!!! if this year you are getting so many complains should be a reason behind it.,0
ps. The above was actually NOT irony. You are the best audience in the world  and Facebook has been filled with the most positive vibe regarding the line-up since we started Facebooking back in '08. Cheers to you guys'n'girls :-),0
No doubt the people are what makes roskilde festival what it is. But the music still plays a pretty huge role and a certain kind of music  draws a certain kind of people. Roskilde festival should atleast make sure that the majority of the guests isn´t 16-17 year old  pop  girls  whom  artists like Rihanna will draw.. Unless you dont mind the festival becoming something it hasn´t been in the main part of its life. So you might consider getting the acts that you think represents  the roskilde spirit   instead of what will sell tickets. The hippies are dead! :O,0
The truth is all the whiners sux  the lineup rules,0
okay...then your music taste is quite awfull :) congrats!,0
You won't regret it Kelly. An adventure in music (or so we of course think so  or we wouldn't be doing it)  but the people...the  Roskilde people  out there in front of the stages and in the camping area. They are one of a kind. The nicest and most welcoming people in the worlds (and no  that ain't irony),0
Yes! That's more like it. Missed the capital letters  -),0
Would be super with Mumford and Sons! :),0
Yeah. We've been trying to be more evil lately  but it simply isn't getting through :-),0
I concur  Mr. Kerr..! Way to many thefts.,0
Well  I hope that you find some gems in there for you as well Marcel. And of course you are more than welcome to feel that the Rihanna booking was a joke. We like it (of course)  but we're all different. Here's an old post with a bookers perspective about it by the way (if interested) -> http://www.orangepeeling.com/archives/741,0
That was...an unusual one :-),0
FUCK YOU ROSKILDE! You will only be forgiven if you somehow get Daft Punk on that line-up by tonight!!!,0
You're wrong!...we have SEVERAL shite bookers. But we love them  and wouldn't trade them or their work for the world,0
You're a rock festival and shouldn't be involved in handing out millions to charity. Think it's ok that the local sports and culture clubs sell food and earn some money  but if i want to give money to charity there's billions of choices plus i as a dane contribute around 15 billion in foreign aid every year,0
DAFT PUNK DOESNT TOUR THIS SUMMER AT ALL!,0
*sigh* Daft punk does not tour at all this summer. You cant see them anywhere.,0
Mumford and Sons yes!!! My bf would kiss the booker's feet!,0
SURE TOLLE :D ...how I love you!,0
Jacob: Well  you could also say that we are a huge fundraiser...with music in it. Or that we are a huge crazy camping trip with a bit more drinking than your liver would like  or...a million other things  depending on who you are and where you're looking from. It's all a matter of perspective.,0
wrong. you can see them in a tiny ass town in the middle of no where australia. http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/entertainment-us-australia-daftpunk-idUSBRE93F06N20130416,0
Well  hope to see you back one day  anyway. Did you catch Trentemøller at Orange Stage back in 2009?,0
Well  then you would be happy to know that we are actually again this year trying out different things to get the trash trashed. Lots of trash  yes  but this is definitely something that we are gonna get a hold of in the next few years. It's a (trash) moving process,0
Only three hours now :-),0
That depends entirely on you  ) No  unfortunately I didn't. I wasn't listening to his music back then. I'm also very sad  that I didn't know Fevery Ray  when they played at Roskilde. Which brings me to  that I REALLY don't understand  why someone like Roskilde  hasn't booked someone like The Knife this year. That's a mystery to me. I'm just excited that I get to see them at all. And don't get me wrong  I sincerely treasure my years at Roskilde  more than anything  as the best days of my my life. But mostly for the music  and I'm sad to see that be a thing of the past (: Also  to me  Roskilde was never just a rock festival. It's much more than that.,0
Apollo Jr.? That's a new one :),0
Truth is...we've been watching Facebook since 2008  and this year has BY FAR had the best response on our line-ups. Yup  there is a lot of  new stuff   but that's more or less our thing (or so we hope so at least).,0
Damn  what is it called now again?,0
I live 5minuttes form Northside  but it is so borring a lineup that I would pay 300kr max for it.. and it would only be to see The Knife.. the resten have play at Roskilde when they where at the top,0
I clearly wrote Pavilion Jr  Facebook must have mixed it up!  ),0
Hana: No  not really. They won't be there in person.,0
Er... Leif wasn't fired. Thus  he can't really be brought back  if he doesn't want to.,0
If the fans were the least bit realistic that might be a viable model.,0
Why did we spend money on Rihanna? Well  because we think she's going to do a hell of a show of course. We love music (including pop) simple as that -> http://www.orangepeeling.com/archives/741,0
Jacob -> wow.. do you know what Roskilde Festival is? I am not sure,0
I just love all the ppl that think they know how much is spend on Rihanna,0
Sure.  But be honest  I don't see why they have to pretend like they're listening to the fans  when they clearly aren't  at all.,0
Why? She is at least good looking,0
Becoures they are fabbing in the studie?,0
Thanks for the honesty  and yes  we definitely have a large focus on new Nordic music and electronic music in the first days of the festival.,0
I would come just for the music.. the lineup at this point is so strong.. and we will get a lot more in a few hours :D,0
Northsides lineup sux.. it is borring and full of hashbeenings..,0
What make you think they dont listen? They do  that a lot... but even if they had the chance to book Daft Punk  AC/DC  RATM or what ever.. ppl will whine,0
If they book Daft Punk  there will be tens of thousands of extremely happy people out there  and they'll be the envy of the festival world.  What makes me think they don't listen?  Because no-one asked for Rihanna.,0
Karina: Reading your last sentence shows that you definitely understands what we're all about  so yes  of course we hope to get some of your bands next year. Have a cool summer,0
Listen to this man Roskilde  he knows whats up^,0
good names good names!! i really hope for Woodkid even though i have heard he isn't that strong live. the guy just makes uniqe music. btw try listen to this Magnus if you like James blake  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sFwGWy0hLs  Analogik won't be there this year i think  since they played last year :),0
*More metal,0
A rarely heard request. Actually  if you're hooked on the violin  then you should check out Frank Fairfield who's playing this year. It's a WHOLE different part of the world  but he plays one mean violin (and banjo),0
I agree somewhat  the line up last year was pretty shoddy... I'll come for atmosphere Roskilde but you're lucky that Download Festival has a shit atmosphere these days and they don't look after their fans.,0
The trick is not to eat only cake all the time. Break for breathing :-),0
Why Rhianna!!! What´s wrong with MC Hammer!!!???,0
http://images.starpulse.com/pictures/2012/05/01/previews/Rihanna-20120501-59.jpg come again..,0
Noooo. You dodged our evil marketing scheme. Dammit :-) Just kidding. Have a nice summer Stine. Maybe we'll see you again some day,0
Will look into it,0
Nah I dont got hate for Daft Punk.. but I will pick Kraftwerk over Daft Punk,0
The truth is that we're actually not ironic. You've been very lovin' and understanding this year. Most positive year since we started looking at Facebook in 2008 Another truth is...that we all like different kinds of music  -),0
Bring the love people - bring the love,0
It wasn't irony. We actually haven't had many complaints this year. Most quiet year on Facebook since we started Facebooking in '08,0
I see  then i am gonna spam your page every day with complaints. It is not irony either...,0
Saw Feed Me at Way Out West last year. Most underwhelming concert at that festival.,0
Price is more or less the same as in 2009.,0
Spids Nøgenhat's album doesn't drop until autumn. Maybe they're ready to play it live  maybe not.,0
They won't tour at all this summer.,0
Daft Punk aren't touring at all this summer.   And judging by the number of Facebook likes on the news announcement that Rihanna is coming  it seems like she is the most popular booking in a very long while. Four times as popular as QOTSA  Slipknot or Sigur Rós and she even outshines Mr. Springsteen from last year. Now... do you still believe your claim that no one wants her?,0
Not touring.,0
i wish they were..,0
I said no-one asked for her.  This FB account isn't claiming (as they should)  The masses will eat up whatever we give them   it's  Ask and we shall provide.  Which just isn't true.,0
All this being said  I look forward to being proved completely wrong this evening  at 8 o'clock.,0
noteret (Y),0
They probably won't.. they've planned a tour later this year :),0
Don't pull your prententious diversity speech roskilde. It's getting old  it's too easy  and it's quite far from having any actual meaning. We can all say we love music  it's a very easy and simple statement that doesn't carry any impact. I like pop too  and it was awesome when Toto played in 88  but you aren't honestly going to call the same pride in announcing something like Rihanna? This discussion goes way beyond that however. Listen to what Mikkel Hessholt is saying in this thread  you've lost your touch  you're leaning towards langeland or Skive beach. Roskilde started as an idea  became a phenomenon and a lifestyle for some people. The Orange feeling was passed down to you from generations of idealists - and honestly  you weren't worthy the inheritance that was given to you. What makes Roskilde  and what you termed the orange feeling  are the people. The volunteers and the audience  not your soundvenue reading hipster bookers who all think they invented something new when they call in their own little  unique  addition to the festival. Roskilde is carried on the shoulders of it's guests and volunteers  whom frankly you haven't shown any goddamn respect for a long time. Get your priorities straight.,0
we bring love.. but after seeing ur program.. we bring love another place..,0
thats a lie.. but sounds good!,0
Because  no doubt Rihanna will sell lots of tickets and people will leave the concert happy. But if thats your only criteria I think you´ve missed the point of booking music to roskilde- and the effects it has on the guests it brings to the festival and thereby the effects it has on the whole festival.,0
more trash! less order! the festival is becoming more and more like a trip to sunny beach with all these luxuries. Let the guests decide what happens on the festival  not all these boundaries. Only assist with food  drink  cold showers  toilets  fire-  medical-  and policeservic  ),0
hear hear! so true!,0
Arctic Monkeys played Arena 2006  just saying...  ),0
I know  I saw'em there  ) - and at the Orange stage in 2011 (I think it was).,0
And yeah  a lot of the bands that I want to see at Northside this year  I've seen at Roskilde  which was such a great experience  that I just have to see them again (: One of me most prized Roskilde music memories was The Flaming Lips at the Orange stage in 2007 (with sunshine). Never heard of them at the time  and it was pure love at first sight <3,0
that one band plays at roskilde one year has nothing to do with them not playing there the next. look at volbeat  ffs. those guys have been playing on roskilde every fucking year since 09 i think  and theyre playing again this year.,0
also  stop booking volbeat every year. seriously  theyve been there waaaay too much. their music really isnt that interesting.,0
Don't forget  they played Odeon in 2006 and opened the Orange Stage in 2007  ),0
In Bergen  Hamburg  Malmö and Oslo you can watch the Line-up release at 20.00 in corporation with Roskilde Road Trip!   Have a look at the events here: Roskilde Road Trip Bergen  Roskilde Road Trip Hamburg  Roskilde Road Trip Malmö and Roskilde Road Trip Oslo,1
Why no mention of Iceland?,0
Roskilde Road Trip isn't passing through Iceland this year. Still love Iceland though,0
And Iceland loves Roskilde!,0

Funny that people mention they already know Green Day plays in Copenhagen but still believes they will come top Roskilde..,0

Didn't catch Enter Shikari back in 2008  so how about adding them to this year's line-up? They have just released a new album  too!,0
Just ask The Roots to play a couple of RATM songs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMn6CECfDJM,0

Pleeeeeeaaaaase bring them baaaaaaack!!!!!!,1
Do you like to be on top of new music?   - Minds of 99 played on our Rising Stage in 2014  moved up and opened the Orange Stage in 2015 and this year they're closing the Arena. Can you guess who's next?  Picture from 2014 by Christian Hjorth:,1
What happened to the  rule  of not letting a band play 2 years in a row,0
That's not a rule. If an act release new material or go through other kind of development that justify that is not the same show  they could easy play back to back years.,0
Ok thanks Mads. Just wondered 'cos it's very rare with the same act 2 years in a row at Roskilde but hey i don't mind,0
My favourite place to be! <3,0
Start on wednesday? One wish  EMINEM! The festival would be sold out before he could turn his hat backwards  -),0
Let’s start one day earlier in 2015.  The music’s playing from Wednesday to Saturday (1-4 July)  and the campsite opens Saturday 27 June.  More info: http://po.st/rf15earlier  Photo: Vegard S. Kristiansen,242

I've worn it since 2011 in honor. Unfortunately it is no more wearable. What a beautiful reminder of a great festival. :-),0
Thanks  Fabian. We hope to see you again so that you can get a new wristband to wear out :-),0
I thought the new update for the app would solve the problems with crashing app at start-up when using Sony Xperia Z5 but it still doesn't work. Will you fix it soon 'cos not long time to go now and this has been an issue for a couple of months. Hopefully you sort it out soon 'cos it is great for finding new acts and put them strait in to my festivalschedule. See you soon,0
Hi Jocke We're truly sorry it still isn't working. We've been assured that everything will be alright with the third version of the app (we expect to release it in the second half of June).,0
27 5 tons of food!  That's how much we've collected from kitchen scraps from Roskilde Festival. This amounts to about 50 000 meals.  Together with the Stop Wasting Food movement Denmark  we're donating all this to the socially marginalized at hostels  shelters and asylum centres.  Photo: Martin Kaufmann,33
When you start bragging about charity  its no longer charity,0
Joachim Von Der Fehr  we've made sure that the food is preserved correctly  so don't worry :-),0
Villiam  so all the millions we've given to charity over the years don't count because we tell you about it? Come on!,0
I was being ironic sort of  but in my opinion it looks kind of pathetic to post about on social media,0
Didn't catch the irony. How does it look pathetic to tell about good deeds?  At some point we'll start donating all our profits (which everyone helped make) to good causes - we might want to tell you about those as well.,0
Im just salty cause my ticket was stolen at the festival and i had to travel home after 1 day.. Nothing wrong about this really,0
All in favor for Funkadelic on Roskilde say AYE!!!!!!,0
when do the tickets for 2015 go on sale?,0
Thinking about 2015 already  are we? Well  so are we! Can't be specific now  though - but we'll let you know in time.,0
Hi! I'm from Israel and me and a friend came to RF14 this year. Of course it was fantastic and the people were very welcoming and hospitable!:) Just wanted to share something with you guys that is a bit annoying: At first when we came to order the tickets we understood that there is no acceptance to credit cards outside of the EU and the Americas.  We wanted to come really badly and so  we managed to get the proper card and eventually to pay for the tickets. After we came back home  you sent a survey of how we experienced the festival and of course I was happy to answer UNTIL I found the Israel is not part of the coutries to choose where I'm from.... Coincidence?I think not...:( Next time  If you don't want someone from a specific region to come-JUST SAY SO...there are many other festivals in Europe that are more welcoming... Food for thought. thank you and goodbye.,0
I don't work for the festival  but you can be pretty sure that the lack of Israel in the list of countries is an oversight and not a deliberate decision  considering how welcoming the festival also is to bands as well as guests from countries all over the world in general.   The credit card thing is a problem that lies squarely with the ticket vendor and not Roskilde Festival. In other words  you're trying to connect dots that doesn't really connect  so I hope you'll be back another time.,0
Hi Assaf   Like Anders has pointed out  this is an error in our ticket vendor's system. And OF COURSE they don't deliberately leave out any countries - no matter what's going on in the world.  We'll make sure to pass on the message and get it fixed.,0
And we have a winner! This photo was the most popular in the contest for best audience photo.  Congratulations to photographer Jakob Aabling-Thomsen who wins a ticket to #rf15. As does Marisse Douma  one of the many voters - keep an eye on your inbox.  Thanks to everyone for being a part of this. Let's do it again next year!,6
Will Coleclough Is this you? Hahaha,0
Love this photo !!!,0
Didn't this picture have the most likes?,0
Yeah Sebastian - the one with girl getting water all over her by these guys: Photo: Christoffer Rosenfeldt/Kevin Goss-Ross It got over 2500 votes  and this one only got a little under 900... I don't get it!,0
No fabulousprizes for the runnerups?,0
Great picture but a really bad execution on the voting. Instead of doing what everyone else does and what most obviously expected you decided to require a comment = vote. Seems to me you have 2 winners :-),0
Embarrassing voting process. I mean come one  there's a dude checking his phone right smack in the middle of the picture.,0
Personally  I think the image by Christoffer Rosenfeldt should of won as it had most likes. I understand the reasoning behind using comments as the voting metric to get more engagement  but it is flawed  after all  what if 2 people get into a debate in the comments? Also if people make multiple comments it pushes up that entry. Plus it doesn't remove the issue of people with huge social networks voting as they can still get their friends to post a comment.  To make a more interesting voting metric I believe you should of added a weighted score the shares  likes and comments for each picture. (for example a like being 1 point  a share 1 point and a comment 1 point). That way the entire engagement of each picture is taken into account. In this case the winner had 893 likes and 854 comments  the 2nd place had 2535 likes and 769 comments.  In this particular case  I think the 2nd place runner up should get some kind of prize  because the metrics really produced an odd outcome with this competition.,0
Well no matter what  i think the winner is well deserved! The atmosphere around the guy is fantastic  and it makes you wish  that you were a part of the moment yourself! :-),0
so good pik,0
Hello everyone ....   We are two Foxkeepers from Roskilde that for the first time in history - got permission to bring a real animal at the Roskilde Festival 2014.   RoskildeRæven (The RosFox)   None of us could in our wildest dreams have imagine  that RoskildeRæven could bring so much joy and surprises - as it did.   The Fox was left Thursday night at a dirty fence - and it is our hope  that another loving soul  took the animal and gave it a complete festival ...   We want all of you - which have photos of the fox – from Thursday and onward – to post the pictures on this page for everyone's enjoyment and sharing ...   With love –The Foxkeepers ...

Too many times? How can that be possible?,0
And they are booked for Northside,0
The release will not take place at Inkonst  but you will be able to watch it there. We are not able to stream the concerts from the Roskilde Road Trip venues even though it would be great  -).,0
That's a shame. But good to hear that you'll be putting it out there!,0

Do you have to remain on the Festival site at all times or can you stay in an apartment and travel to the festival each day? What's the average temperature during the festival? (looking at this festival for 2015!),0
I think there's a pretty good chance of at least Palma Violets. They're in the neighbourhood during the festival.,0

Six and a half minutes of an amazing and intense Mogwai concert at Roskilde Festival 2014. Here's Remurdered. ,49
God damn they're so good live,0

Breathtaking  Intense and beautiful concert!,0

MAKE ROSKILDES FUNK THE P-FUNK,0
Well  he was playing shows in Denmark with an outrageous ticket-pricetag at the same time. If he were to play Roskilde  he wouldn't have sold a single ticket to his own shows.,0
Anyway  it would be amazing to see him at Orange =),0
It's Wednesday and that usually means music-for-Roskilde-day. Today is no exception. We are thrilled to welcome The Roots and Jonathan Johansson to Roskilde Festival 2012.  Btw  The Roots play at Roskilde Festival as the only Scandinavian job this summer. Look forward to it. We know we do.,57
ja tak!! the roots bliver lækkert :D,0
Amazing. This is dope! ,0
 Only scandinavian job ? But why? I assume that by Scandinavian you mean except Danish..,0
Already the best year for me! :),0
Sebastian Sild Kirk  it means that they will play no other place but Roskilde in all of Scandinavia this summer.,0
@sebastian. I think they mean that the roots are only playing at Roskilde  and not any other places in scandinavia.,0
Yearh  I just got that now.. I read it the wrong way  as in they'd be the only Scandinavian job Roskilde would hire... That would be kind of insane.. :),0
Yyeeeeesss!!! The Roots this summer!! Join us for more festivals news https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jaime-les-festivals-I-Love-festivals/172748306101657,0
I've seen The Roots three times here in Finland and they are always GREAT. Looking forward to their Roskilde gig! <3,0
FUNKADELIC TO ROSKILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Signe: And has that anything to do with the music bookings here?,0
Was that the  think out of the box  name you talked about yesterday? :/ never heard of em :(,0
@Signe Vad Kaastrup Really? 32 hours for 1800 DKK? Wow  that's insane. If it wasn't described as  voulenteer work  it would be strongly illegal in Denmark! I really do understand why you boykot them.. I myself always buy the ticket  so it wont affect me  but I still think it's outrageous!,0
So fuckin awesome!,0
Martin  never heard of them? You've got some learning to do  then :-),0
The Roots!!! Thank you so much! :),0
@ Signe. Slave labour my ass...,0
please let them come together with D'Angelo.,0
Please do the volunteer talk in a separate thread. This one's dedicated to today's annoucement. Thanks!,0
Now you just need a bigger metal/rock band..,0
Release some awesome rock bands soon! Foo fighters!!,0
@jonas - relax. A lot of artists are yet to be revealed. Roskilde is so much more than music.,0
THE ROOOOOOOOOOTS!!!,0
More metal!,0
If Conor Comes then I'll come. Otherwise  I will stick to  my Coachella plans this year. Your program from last year is impossible to beat. I was there in the rain and it was really amazing. Conor and The strokes  but not this year.. I'll se you another time. Enjoy your festival. :-),0
What happened to the  legendary ?,0
Jakob Fris Pedersen  they're also referred to as The Legendary Roots Crew,0
The Rooooooooots! This lineup is becoming so insane!,0
Is this the legendary act? Rubbish. ,0
Loes de Groot  they are quite possibly the best live hip hop act out there. And they've been going at it since 1987 - with undiminished force. They definitely deserve a star in music history.,0
Loes - what did you expect? A stadium act? Like they said it wouldn't be?.. The Roots is a goddamn fantastic hiphop booking!!,0
Why is everybody talking about The Roots? The great news today is Jonathan Johansson!!,0
Thank you so much! Keep 'em coming!,0
very nice booking!,0
The Roots!,0
I might as well buy my ticket now.,0
Jakob: The Roots is known as  The Legendary Roots Crew   so there you have your  legendary . I predicted that it would be The Roots based on that clue.,0
is all the big money used up  was hoping for music for a younger  broader crowd  like foo fighters and mumford and sons,0
Kurt: Foo Fighters are actually almost 20 years old  so... younger? I dunno  man. As for Mumford & Sons... have you heard Bon Iver? Same genre  and he is probably even more known than those guys. I wouldn't be surprised if he took the 2nd biggest stage on the festival.,0
Kurt: One would expect that Hip-Hop is a genre preffered by lots of young people  so this booking does satisfy alot of younger people  ) for me  this booking is just an insane addition  but unfortunately we probarly wont see that many hip-hop bookings from now on  which is sad since i was rooting for Danny Brown/Asap Rocky/Main Attrakionz/Action Bronson,0

Did you experience the amazing Damon Albarn show at #RF14? Now you can watch some highlights from the magical night at Arena. ,116
I went to see him after Deftones. Deftones were so much better!,0
Nope. But I will soon  ),0
Such a good show! Looked like he had a good time. And dont forget De La Soul!,0
AMAZING is the word!  so happy we were there early enough to get a good place in the pit  unforgettable concert.,0
That Feel Good Inc. tho!! DAMN,0
Omg this concert i will never forget  it was truely the best on Roskilde this year -),0

Thank you!,0
Better than Magic :D,0
Best act at Roskilde festival this decade.,0
I didn't. And I'm fucking bummed out about it :(,0
Fine concert. But too bad that everybody diden't knew the lurics of  Heavy seas of love' ...,0
Would it be possible to experience the whole concert again? It was so amazing!,0
Cried through that magic moment in the middle of  Feel Good Inc. . Goosebumps...,0
Clint Eastwood at Lizzie's cocktail bar. THE high point of RF14,0

PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN!,0
Looking for someone who goes from Belgium to Roskilde! (after werchter),0
Have you tried in here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/forum,0
What time will you be announcing the new artist (The Roots) tomorrow? Thanks.,0
Expectedly around 9 or 10. There are two artists. So far we've only mentioned one :-),0
No clues for the other artist? (:,0
Headliner ? stadium act ? sounds like a big name :),0
Wouldn't  When we say legendary  you think stadium act. Think out of the box - and check back tomorrow to see what we actually think.  indicate that it isn't a stadium act and therefore not a headliner? You are asked to think outside the box.,0
Well  technically the Roots probably wouldn't headline either  if your initial guess is correct. They would subline at best  taking the Arena stage or something along those lines.,0
My thoughts exactly! And besides that  the group is also known as The Legendary Roots Crew.,0
And furthermore  they released their new album just a month ago so I think it's pretty likely after all.,0
Jedi: These are not the artists you're looking for. Roskilde: These are not the artists we're looking for. Jedi: Book Daft Punk Roskilde: We will book Daft Punk,0

Roskilde Festival 2016 ticket update!  Silent & Clean and Entrance Bookings for West are sold out. Entrance Booking for South is still available.   Full festival tickets will probably sell out today!,42
If you don't book entrance booking what time can you arrive?,0
Do I understand it correct that its not possible to camp in Silent & Clean area  if I dont have booking?,0
Roskilde Festival Hey guys  we would love to buy a (just 1) South Entrance Booking. Is that still possible ?,0
Can't i enter from The west IF i have à south entrance ticket?,0
Jaja (y),0
After those with entrance bookings have gotten in  an hour or two maybe? Not sure,0
A couple of hours after  is our best guess,0
No. It just means that if you havewn't booked  you can't enter the area until after midnight between 25 June and 26 June.,0
Sorry  no,0
No. The entrance bookings only give you access to that specific waiting area. After the festival has started you can enter through all entrances with a valid wristband.,0
i am caming on friday.. What time Can i enter through The west entrance?,0
We open Saturday 25 June at 16:00,0
so what time can i enter thru The west utan entrance ticket?,0
I wanna see more of this....,0

Today we add a Danish package of upcoming acts ranging from acoustic folk to punky electro.  In the quiet part of the spectrum we find Schultz And Forever and Kristina Renée.   So-so Echo play delicious pop wrought with danger and brimming with international format. Broke departs from the financial crisis and prove that punky electro is best during recessions.  We also add Travelling Tribes  who use the entire palette of world music as departure point for their alternative rock.  On 18 April we reveal the full line-up for Roskilde Festival 2013!,14

How about this young band Ghost Of Belle Starr. They sound great live aswell!,0
Are you ready for some headbanging?,87
Oh look  lots of bands nobody cares about,0
Feed the troll!,0
I'm Rrrrrready for Rrrrammstein!!,0
well sure  there is alot of metal acts  but the problem is the quality...,0
Headbanging  og så nævner i queens of the.... Og Volbeat... Sødt....,0
BRING NNE INCH NAILS FFS THEY JUST STARTED TOURING AGAIN,0
Oh look  a funny guy,0
As if nobody cares about Slipknot or Queens of The Stone Age. Dbag.,0
Hahahahah  so much butthurt!,0
Oh look  somebody should broaden their horizon,0
As long as they are headbanging trolls  we gladly feed them  -),0
Dillinger escape plan is as high quality live metal can get!!!,0
Well... I'm not satisfied by one name alone.,0
Probably not. They got gigs 6-7th of july. Slipknot will probably headline the 4th so that would leave the 5th. I very much doubt Rammstein plays 3 nights in a row. Also 2 metal headliners is probably too much.,0
there cant be to much metal headliners!,0
Carsten: You are spot on. We are NOT a metal genre specific festival. We're just like the metal part of our line-up  and are posting it to get you involved in which bands you're looking forward to and which bands you couldn't care less about. Seems to be working  -),0
Not sad. Good and metal is also longest survivor in rock genre :),0
oh look lots of bands roskilde newfags dont care about because they only listen to rihanna and kendrick lamar,0
oh look  theyre trying to make it up to the  metal fans  by booking.. 1  2  3? no ELEVEN bands that we can enjoy. thats fucking 4% of the total lineup! why are they even advertising it?,0
Yes. The line-up release is on 18 April 20.00.,0
No  actually  to be a complete smartass about it  they don't start touring until after Roskilde.,0
Because only 40-45% of the lineup is announced.,0
Anaal Nathrakh are awesome!,0
 We're just like the metal part of our line-up  = We are just like the metal part of our line-up. I don't get it.,0
Jonathan Rydström: Understandable.  We just like the metal part...  was what it really should have said  but a brain corrupted by coffee fucked it up :-),0
so fucking true!,0
Tak for The Roots <3,0
This most important thing to underline here is that it's not a popularity contest. We use the requests as an extra input for our work.,0
I never saw it as a popularity contest  i was just curiuos how you use the requets,0
Good. It's just the wording we've notice going around - bands asking for 'votes',0
If that was the case  you wouldn't get many underground bands,0
When we say legendary  you think stadium act. Think out of the box - and check back tomorrow to see what we actually think.,14
How I Met Your Mother marathon?,0
The Legendary Pink Dots,0
Tenacious D? :D,0
I think of Barney Stinson. A marathon of how i met your mother episodes at roskilde cinema?,0
It's all the members of Club 27!,0
Neil Young and Crazy Horse !,0
Radiohead? :D,0
Legendary non-stadium act? hmm.. Sounds world-ish to me,0
Metallica or ACDC,0
Watch The Throne,0
Refused or At the Drive-In? Damp: Nice try.,0
D-A-D,0
Watch The Throne,0
the legendary Jarvis...,0
probably some band with a mythology related name,0
Some of the bigger acts playing Rock Werchter as usual?,0
Finally  The Legendary Roots Crew!!,0
The Legendary Roots Crew!,0
D-A-D ofc! Real danish rock power!!,0
Hercules And Love Affair,0
At The Drive-In,0
the overmuch box  D-A-D!!!,0
its the R to the Double O to the TS!!!,0
At the Drive-in  hopefully!,0
My mom,0
When you say legendary  we think: Barney Stinson :),0
Must Be teenacius D then!! :),0
I have to agree  bring on At the Drive-In!,0
tenacius d :),0
Tenacious D! Bring it!!,0
Keeping my fingers crossed for Black Sabbath. Or else RATM will have to do ),0
Hope it's Daft Punk!!!,0
Must be John legend. ,0
Eno or Numan ,0
Mumford and sons  yo!,0
See what they wrote:  Think out of the box .   It is not going to be anything near  AC/DC  Metallica  Daft Punkt or RATM even though I really hope the last two are coming.   I'm afraid that is could be something like John Legend or The Legendary Roots Crew...,0
Awesome  I'd love to see Queen  but how are you going to bring Freddie Mercury back to live again? Some kind of new technology?,0
John Legend is not stadium act,0
Stadium bands are the biggest bands in the world,0
Rolling stones or AC/DC!,0
It better be Tom Waits!,0
It's got to be  The Legendary Pink Dots  who else  -),0
Tool!! plz?  D,0
Refused and at the drive-in. On the same stage. ,0
Out of the box disables every classic rock act.. Legendary hints on having some history... a band without rock and being old... hmmm Since i wont be there on saturday it can only be Daft Punk headlining saturday night on Orange stage.. thanks! :-),0
Surely it's the one and only... RICK ASTLEY!,0
Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits!!!!,0
Calm down people. I'm sure that RF will present something that will disapoint everybody.,0
I think everyone is looking at big acts  it's more of a play on words if you look at it  suggesting someone who is legendary but not a stadium sized act  think outside of the box must be the bigger clue  hopefully it's refused as they never played stadium sized venues before but are legends for what they do  or John legend is feisable due to his name xxx,0
Please confirm it if there is a correct answer  Roskilde Festival!,0
Afroman  so high !,0

Roskilde Festival is all about presenting the hottest new acts and the stars of tomorrow.   Oresundsfestival in Malmö is revealing their full line-up today and Roskilde Festival takes part in the booking of some of the best acts from Sweden and Denmark for Öresundfestival.   We are proud to announce  that Roskilde favourites Iceage will play Öresundfestival 2013. Iceage played their first Roskilde gig in 2010 on our upcoming Pavilion Junior stage. In 2011 they came back and played an amazing concert on the Odeon Stage.   “Iceage is a band that we have kept a close eye on since the very start of their career. It is great to see how they in a very short time have become one of the most talked about and praised bands in Denmark as well as abroad” says Roskilde Festival music booker  Stefan Gejsing.,2
Dear Roskilde. Once upon a time there was a service in the wardrobes  where one could get a new  cold  fryseelement  in exchange for an old one. Is this still a thing? :),0

Last chance TODAY - make the world more orange and win Roskilde 2013 tickets for your camp!  Challenge: Put up posters in creative ways in cities outside of Denmark.  Prize: 10x3 tickets to Roskilde Festival 2013 (10 camps will win 3 tickets each)  Sign-up here: http://tinyurl.com/bmkwg3v  Deadline for sign-up: Today at 23.59,13
Where do i get a poster to do it with?,0
I used to do that in the Netherlands  when you still had 'ambassadors' here :),0
Print some  make your own... I guess :),0
Afraid of Danish police comming after you because people put your posters everywhere? :P,0
Mikkel: If your camp is selected  we'll send you the posters when they are out of the printers,0
Mirella van der Made: I remember those days. You did a good job,0
Kenneth: The posterhanging has to be legal of course :-),0
Steen El Duderino Thomsen: The  innovative  aspect can be in anything from the physical places the posters are hanged  HOW they are put up  a well-thought of marketing plan behind the hanging etc. Anything that shows that you have actually thought of how they can have the biggest orange impact,0
I know  but how many  creative  spots are legal?  ),0
I loved the idea!,0
Well. That's up to you to find out :-),0
Yeah and thats why I asked  ),0
MUSE will be announced very soon....Tell me I am wrong Roskilde  or am I right :-),0
Why do you think Muse will be announced very soon?,0
Would never mind a 3rd concert with MUSE! :),0
Have been following the tour around to a few countries  awesome and I hope Roskilde has booked them:-),0
Could be. Muse said earlier this year  that they would announce danish concert  but nothing happened. This could - maybe - be because of Roskilde-concert? I hope not. Please. Do not book them.,0
Hello Jonas. I would also love to have seen them in their own concert in DK  but as all the other shows are already announced in Scandinavia  I can only guess that it is Roskilde that they will play.,0
And if it's true  it is a waste of a headline-spot. If it were Muse as in 5-7 years ago I would like this.,0
Alt-j is a band that should get the chance to play at roskilde 2013! They're soooo good! ,0

Well  guess that is pretty good  but relative to the 130.000 festival goers  this is not nearly enough!,0
Good to hear  but I have to say... that's not enough  not even close. Not when there is still thousands of tents  sleeping bags and all that going straight to the garbage. 1550 tents considering the magnitude of this festival is just a slight number. Not enought. We need to do self-criticism starting for every camper  but mostly from Roskilde Festival side  the responsable of all  through the good and the bad. How could we improve the problem? The after-Festival is just insane  sad and shameful...,0
Aris Emilio Kourkakis there we go!,0
What a great idea!,0
There are places too leave stuff u want to donate and people in Orange vests go around the camp sites afterwards... But many ppl destroy there tents instead of donating  sad to say...,0
Social ansvarlighed - I blow you a kiss ??,0
My deepest RESPECT for the volunteers who dived into the garbage of 115000 ?? people to make it become something helpful !!!! <3 <3 <3,0
Great initiative but #RF15 must up the game seriously on the problem of waste and unsustainable behavior. Make it fashionable and cool to embrace #circulareconomy and #sharingeconomy. Disgrace to otherwise amazing festival and fantastic crowd.,0
It's nice to know that our leftovers go to people in desperate need of them. And I hope someone will put my used allstar shoes to good use!,0
very cool!!,0
the more I read about this  festival the more I want to attend it,0
Was there in 2011 and they are playing Skanderborg this year,0
Earlier today we added the two On-Stage bookings Urban Cone and The Woken Trees to the line-up!  We now add a second Swedish band compadre. They mix hip hop  bass pop and Middle Eastern tunes in their self-proclaimed ‘Muslim-step’ or ‘Jihad House’.  We can also announce another Danish act Ice Cream Cathedral They play great atmospheric dream pop.   Finally we add Navneløs to the line-up. They explore the genres and incorporate chamber music  alternative rock and much more into their music.,8
Brian Gronemann: Dammit. You caught us. Yes  we are handpicking artist from a wide variety of genres that  in a their combination  will make you enter a zombie-state of sleepyness. This enables us to easier plant subliminal  YOU MUST BUY A TICKET...NOW!  messages directly into your brain. A scheme you will first discover when you re-surface from the hypnosis lying on the fields of Roskilde...drunk  half-naked and next to a girl you don't know the name of. Yet again tricked into attending. Well  ok. Just taking a piss :-) If it makes you fall asleep  it makes you fall asleep. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. Hope you'll find some gems in the final line-up for you as well Brian.,0
Are all pavilion Junior names because the description of Urban Cone and Compadre sound very very Apollo Countdown´ish,0
Who gets the chance to play at Roskilde 2013? The bookings for On-Stage are…  The Woken Trees  http://www.facebook.com/thewokentrees?fref=ts  &  Urban Cone  http://www.facebook.com/urbancone?fref=ts,7
Not cool.. Should've picked Lady-like!,0
thank you for The Woken Trees..... now please add The Exploding Boy (Official) and i will have greatest festival ever!!!,0
A lot of shitty music this year..,0
Could've been Massive  but nooo....,0
ahaha urban cone this will be the most boring concert in roskilde history,0
you know taht you would make a boy cry of joy if you booked M83  Coldplay  The black Keys and grizzly bear,0
Brilliant festival! Thank you! What do you think of this design for Crew T-shirt next year?  -),0
Looks good! Be sure to save your design for when we start the contest,0
Will do  will contest be posted on this page?,0
Yes it will. It'll probably be a while though,0
I saw this one in the wild and thought it was this year's crew tee design. It's very nice.,0
This is the coolest design,0
What is this - meant to ask you about a close up you took of this T shirt....????,0

About the toilets at GaT central I dont get it. You d rather stay in a queue at GaT than move your ass 100m into the festival area where there were ZERO queues. Kinda your own fault if you are that lazy. Im pretty sure Roskilde festival decided not to put a lot of facilities at Gat because its so very close to the festival area. Its just as easy to shop and use the toilets there. Ive been living at GaT for 3 years now and it was best this year imho.,0
Our tent-neighbor had a great idea about trolleys in the GAT-area (and of course all camping areas) selling  kildevand and ice. People would gladly pay for that and the profit margin would be worthwhile  these profits could then be used to further improve  all of the camping areas. As previously mentioned  when as the festival gates opened  it was easy to just go into the festival area and get your morning business done.  As far as diversity goes  I think people here are treated as just people  regardless of their subculture connections. You can't force people of subcultures to go to RF  I'm a metalhead foremost and most of my metal friends would rather go to a pure metal festival. RF is still a place for everyone  and making special consessions for subcultures would rather exclude than include people.,0
Wiktor from The United States visited Roskilde Festival for the first time this year  but he quickly picked up on what we're all about. Here's his impression of the festival:  (Video by VisitCopenhagen),50
Here's how Estonians experienced Roskilde Festival for the first time. Here's a playlist of 3 videos. You'll see some dirty shit here :D  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMcWqphmsoj1V-75kPDtMzcDLJS5G3Cwa,0

For the more experimental side. Venetian Snares (Breakcore/IDM) Otpei (Danish IDM) Flashbulb (Breakcore/IDM). Minimal/Tech house: Mark Hennig  Ben Clock  Len Faki. Psychedelic: OTT!!

Frank Fairfield is today's third and final addition to the Roskilde 2013 line-up.   Frank Fairfield plays rustic Americana with plenty of banjo and potent violin.   Today we also added Calexico and Jonathan Wilson to the Roskilde Festival 2013 line-up.,15
Why don't they make nice gig-posters at Roskilde Festival anymore? In US there's a lot of great poster-artwork done  but European venues and festivals are so outdated when it comes to combining art and music. Couldn't Roskilde be a European firstmover on this.,0

Hi. Thanks for a AWESOME festival! I have no words to describe it! But I'm here in DK for a vacation the next weeks. But unfortunately the sweatshirt that I bought in the Merchandise shop by the Orange Stage last sunday is ruined because there is somekind of flaw in the seams and it's ruined. I could wear it for two days. Could you help me out here ?,0
We're glad you had an awesome time! So did we :) Sorry to hear about the sweatshirt. You can contact us about merchandise here: http://rfshop.dk/shop/UK/profile.html,0
Send your volunteer wristband to Roskilde Festival  Havsteensvej 11 4000 Roskilde  And include an envelope with prepaid postage. Then we'll send you a regular wristband. But do it today  there are limited amounts.,0
So if i send it today  you can assure me a regular wristband?,0
Not 100% guarantee  but there are still about 100 left  so there should be one for you too,0
I hope you got my letter  we posted it yesterday! ??,0
I agree. I dont get why people dont clean up after themselves. Thats why for the past 3 years Ive chosen to live at GaT. Those areas are very clean compared to the  free  camping areas. I read somewhere that it was a lot  cleaner  this year though so maybe it will get better every year.,0
Any chance of more 4-pers get-a-tents? They went awfully fast this year.,0
Unfortunately not. We still have a number of other add-on camping offers  that haven't sold out yet. You can check them out here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/ticket/add_ons/,0

1. 	rootsy This occurs when friends get together to enjoy some drinking  smoking  reggae music  and good times. 2. 	Rootsy Rootsy is a term used for masturbating.

The tree Yggdrasil in norse mythology has three roots.Maybe that's a hint or something. Odin sacrificed himself from this tree  hanging himself  making it his GALLOWS.

The three roots of tibetan buddhism. One of them is supposedly  lama . LAMA can stand for Los Angeles Music Academy. This is sooo far-fetched....,0

Thanks for all the great guesses. You guys actually picked out all three names this time.  The top of the picture shows the roots of a tree and the addition of ‘y’ refers to the rootsy genre that these three bands belong in.  The three pictures represent an album cover by each of the three bands. The one to the left is Frank Fairfield’s “Out in the Open West” (http://www.tinyurl.dk/38195).  The picture on the right is Calexico’s “Spoke” (http://www.tinyurl.dk/38194) And the album in the bottom of the picture is Jonathan Wilson’s ”Gentle Spirit” (http://www.tinyurl.dk/38193),0

Thank you Roskilde for making my single biggest wish for the lineup comd true!,0
Well done Roskilde! Now there is only to hope that in the wake of their Reflections shows  they are going to play some more of their really early songs. They played them so well during Reflections.,0

I have two questions for you Roskilde.  As a volunteer I don't get a proper wristband to have as a memento. Is it possible to exchange my volunteer wristband for the real one? And if so  can i do this for earlier years I've worked as well?  Thanks for another awesome festival. See you next year.,0

Looking for that special someone who got lost in the crowd?  We're seeing a lot of people searching for their newfound acquaintances  and we'd like to help you out. Post what you know about the person you're searching for in the comments  and if you're lucky  they'll see it. Photo: Morten Lau-Nielsen,18
Hey Roskilde ! Thanks for a great festival :) I enjoyed it a lot and actually consider it to be my best Roskilde festival so far and it's my sixth :) One thing really annoyed me tho... You always write about how you want the festival to be international  but admit that the percentage of foreign visitors has dropped the last several year. Yet you choose to not show one of the worlds biggest sports events (World cup) where several countries participate including our German neighbors... I actually  ran into several foreigners who where truly annoyed about the fact that they could not see their national team play during the entire festival! enough said :) Thanks for a great festival tho - see you next year!,0
Hey guys. I had an amazing time at my first roskilde festival this year . Anyway  I would really like if you guys help me reach a really special person I met on the festival. I can't reach him because both of our phones were dead (we verified just to make sure we weren't lying). I just know some details about him but if you could spread the word i'd be so fucking thankful. I looked for him every day at east p since we met which was on Thursday but I simply couldn't find him. And right now I'm too sad because of it and it just takes away all the good vibes I had in RF. I recently moved to Copenhagen so I'm pretty lonely and he was the first person I've felt really confortable with  it was practically love at first sight and I know he feels the same way. So if any of you guys have any idea of how can I possibly spread the word  you're welcome to tell them to me . Anyway  here are the few details I know about him:  - His name is Ulrik (I'm not sure if it's spelled that way but that's how it's pronounced) - he's 19 years old so he was born between 1994 and 1995  - he has medium length light brown hair -blue eyes - lives at frederiksberg - graduated from gymnasium two weeks ago  - doesn't want to get tattooed because he believes that we should let our bodies the way they are - he's between 1.85-1.90m tall  - told me the worst and best pick up line ever and called me iBeautiful. I really hope I can find him some day soon.  Anyway  any idea is welcome. Thank you guys.,0
HELP - really help - is needed. I lost my black Canon S90 on Sunday afternoon with all my pictures from Roskilde. I miss it very much and hope to be reunited with it. Did you see or find it? PLEASE HELP!,7

http://youtu.be/hztmgUnRdqo,0
Dear Roskilde Festival  Thank you for a great and very well-organized festival!  I have two pieces of feedback:  1. There was too much deep bass (~40-80hz) on Avalon and Pavilion stages. Bass and kick drums often drowned out the rest of the sound spectrum. The vocals in particular had a hard time. This wasn't a problem on Orange or Gloria  nor  as far as I recall  Arena.  2. The Roskilde Rising stage was a meagre exchange for Pavilion Jr.  The area didn't invite you to stay because it was in the middle of everything and with a big passageway right behind it. Also  the shows were at the mercy of the weather. Pavilion Jr. was great because it was a secluded area with a tent protecting the sound and sheltering us from the rain.  Aside from that  great job everybody!  Best regards.,0
What do you say people? Do you think they´ll play Roskilde? Scandanavia- More Danzig 25th Anniversary tour dates coming your way. And yes  Doyle will be with us. Thursday  July 4: Oslo  Norway- Sentrum Scene Saturday  July 6: Gothenburg  Sweden- Metaltown,0

Got the post-Roskilde blues? What's the best way to cope with it? Photo: Stiig Hougesen,75
Lie down and cry. Cry a lot,0
Keep in touch with the people who touched you. Embrace the orange feeling outside the festival as well!,0
The best way to cope with it  is to listen to the new Take Us To Your Leader single  BioChemical Schemes  (released today)  and be ONE OF US :D http://youtu.be/H7VdrHEhph0,0
Listen to all the great bands you discovered!,0
Start preparing #rf15 with your friends!,0
Eat healthy  work out  talk about the experience! The reason why you get depressed is because you don't sleep well at Roskilde Festival  you're drunk all the time which makes your brain not process the things you experience as well as when you are sober.. So when you get home and it's all quiet your brain starts to process all the things you've experienced! So follow my advices and you'll be fine :),0
Looking back on a possible ending era. 10 years as a Roskilde festival camper is enough. Time to see it from another perspective in the future. Nomatter what #RF15 will be a part of my life next year wherever its only 1 or 4 days of Music  but camping is done,0
Thinking about the fact that there is only 51 short weeks to the next time :),0
I can see my house from here.....!!!,0
Hehe. Touched you,0
listen to this man!! (y),0
Got a walk coming up in an hour and then late tonight I'm going for a run :),0

ups I can see my tent from here :P,0
Then what's the solution to finding confetti everywhere in your stuff when you get home? <3,0
Stay at camp Glimmerbøsser and wear a condom suit,0

Same situation as me. We should totally make something where people can find other roskilde people after the festival  if you were as unfortunate like you and I and couldn't get their numbers or any information to reach them. :(,0
We could definitely come with something up. If you're interested of course. Because I really wanna find my guy and we would be helping each other and other people trying to find their special ones from roskilde  ),0
Let's make a group  Nenée  where we can find lost people from Roskilde Festival!! :-D,0

In the car back home we discussed how you guys can get a replacement artist like Jack White in such a short time. We had a lot of theories  but never got any smarter. If it's no big secret  how do you do it? Thanks for a great festival!,0
At the  awesome Mø concert,0
I would love to see Cloudy Clarity play this year! I really think they would bring something new and fresh to Roskilde!  Their appearance and performance would blow the stage away! Plus they are full of energy that makes it great for moshe :p ,0

I would love to see the talented singer Gaia!!!! ,0

We're afraid not. But keep an eye out here on Facebook for caravan camping tickets. That's the best advice we've got.,0
Hope you will consider enlarging your caravan area since it is obviously too small :-),0
You should share some photos of the clean up efforts in Dream City done by regular festival goers - Perhaps that could spread to other areas in the future.,0

***In Danish***  Hej alle sammen Håber at i alle har haft en god festival!  Jeg står desværre i den ekstrem nederen situation at jeg natten til mandag  fik stjålet min fanny pack..   Den er af sort leder  med en lille gul stof sløjfe på remmen  og to strips til at holde den sammen.   Indholdet bestod af  - 2 par solbriller - servietter - turkisgrøn lommelærker med et lyserødt moustache klistermærker - en plastic pose med ca. 250 kroner i  ””og min HØJT ELSKEDE iPhone 4s med lyserødt mønstret cover!””  Jeg er ligeglad med alle de andre ting.. vil bare så ufattelig gerne have min iPhone tilbage! :’(  Hændelsen har været sket på bakken i K  hvor der er udsigt til Dream City  H-tårnet og kuplen!  Det skete imellem søndag nat kl.02 og mandag morgen kl. 8-9.   (6/7 – 7/7) Hvor jeg sammen med resten af min camp havde besluttet at vi skulle overnatte under åben himmel på luftmadrasser  da det jo var vores sidste nat.   Jeg ved godt at chancerne for at jeg får min iPhone tilbage er helt utrolig minimal!  Jeg syndes bare at det er helt vildt ærgerligt at  en ellers så fed festival  skal slutte sådan her..   God sommer til jer alle!   ***In English***  Hey everybody  I hope you all had wonderful festival!  Unfortunately mine didn't end up the way I had hoped for. The last night of the festival  the night between Sunday and Monday (06.07.14-07.07.14) my fanny pack got stolen.   It got stolen on the hill in the K area  with a view to the Dream City  the tower in the H area and the Dome.  Me and my camp mates slept there under the open sky  as a final thing to do at this years Roskilde Festival.   Description:  - Black leather  - Small yellow ribbon attached on the side  - Held together by two strips   Contained:  - 2 pairs of sunglasses  - Napkins  - Turquoise hip flask decorated with a pink mustache  - A plastic bag with 250 dkk  - MY MOST BELOVED iPhone 4s with a pink patterned cover with  I miss my iPhone 4s so much  it's most precious to me and I want it back so much.   I'm truly sorry that robbery happens at Roskilde Festival and that I had to leave this years festival with a really bad taste in my mouth.   I'm aware that the chances to get my iPhone back are really small. But please  contact me if you saw anything of happen to know where it is!  Have a good summer everyone!,0

Hi Roskilde Festival Will the Bastille concert be available at the website at some point  and if yes  when?,0
Strong upcoming names join the Roskilde Festival 2013 line-up.   From the Copenhagen underground we introduce Solbrud  Lower and Rewolmer.   From Sweden Vanligt Folk are bringing dark industrial post punk to the line-up  while Summer Heart add a bit of melancholic synth pop.   Torkelsen and Binärpilot from Norway both have an icy cold grip on electronic music.   Captain Fufanu is the hottest techno-duo in Reykjavik and add minimal  deep techno to the festival line-up.   From Finland K-X-P are bringing punk rock with a mechanical heart.   These upcoming Nordic bands will play the Pavilion Junior or Apollo Countdown stages during the first four days of the festival  from 30 June till 3 July.,8
It's all in your heeeeeaaaad!,0
Hey guys. I had an amazing time at my first roskilde festival this year :). Anyway  I would really like if you guys help me reach a really special person I met on the festival. I can't reach him because both of our phones were dead (we verified just to make sure we weren't lying). I just know some details about him but if you could spread the word i'd be so fucking thankful. I looked for him every day at east p since we met which was on Thursday but I simply couldn't find him. And right now I'm too sad because of it and it just takes away all the good vibes I had in RF. I recently moved to Copenhagen so I'm pretty lonely and he was the first person I've felt really confortable with  it was practically love at first sight and I know he feels the same way. So if any of you guys have any idea of how can I possibly spread the word  you're welcome to tell them to me :D. Anyway  here are the few details I know about him:  - His name is Ulrik (I'm not sure if it's spelled that way but that's how it's pronounced) - he's 19 years old so he was born between 1994 and 1995  - he has medium length light brown hair -blue eyes - lives at frederiksberg - graduated from gymnasium two weeks ago  - doesn't want to get tattooed because he believes that we should let our bodies the way they are - he's between 1.85-1.90m tall  - told me the worst and best pick up line ever and called me iBeautiful. I really hope I can find him some day soon.  Anyway  any idea is welcome. Thank you guys.,0
Thank you Roskilde for an amazing venue this year. Looking forward to next year. Peace.,0

Time for some Danish music. I Got You On Tape  Larsen & Furious Jane and an acid rock package from the label El Paraiso Records (Causa Sui) are added to the Roskilde 2012 programme.  Today's additions are for fans of both alternative rock and the more out-there excesses from the music underground.,12
Causa Sui! Best Danish Psychedelic Act ever. Glad they finally receive a well deserved recognition in their own country!,0
Causa Sui and Larsen & Furious Jane!! Thank you incredibly much!,0
I'm looking forward to  IGYOT!,0
I've never heard Causa Sui before. But only after a few listens I really love it. Fucking great music. Thanks Roskilde!,0
Mattias Larsson  just wait till you see them live. They're pretty damn intense.,0

Hey Roskilde Festival  when is the map for the camp-site coming out? and is the camping-area gonna be larger this year?,0

The winner of our emoji-competition and two RF16 tickets is Lauge Eilsøe-Madsen! ?? There were a lot of great runners-up so we decided to reward second and third place with 1 ticket each - congratulations to Jakob Pries and Birk Nielsen.,12
We've picked our favorites  and now it's up to you guys to find the winner. Which emoji do you think should end up in our app? 1 like = 1 vote. Vote before May 12 12:00.  Remember: Our graphic designer will give the finishing touch to all emojis before they end up in our app.,11
In a poll like this  it's not a good idea to have a contestant as the first picture. People coming here through the notification might only see the first one and like it without realizing it's a poll. I bet this is part of the reason why the first picture has a HUGE lead (the other part being that it IS probably the best one)...,0
Why?,0
I was thinking the same thing.,0
Just noticed it's not actually in the lead. There's one other that has an actual huge lead over it. But my point of advice still stands. :),0
What do you mean  why? For the fun of it  of course!,0
We've partnered up with Red Bull TV to livestream concerts from #RF16 around the globe in a setup that will offer an even better experience for the viewers. We will be livestreaming concerts from Orange  Arena  Avalon and Apollo as well as artist interviews  stories from the festival and much more.,24
Hi you thief!! The Instant Karma´s gonna get you!!! Taking my guitar from my tent was a low thing to do  I hope a string breaks and hits your eye!,0
I think they will put them up later on the webpage.,0

See you Next year :-),0
I just wanted to thank everyone at Roskilde for putting on another amazing Festival. This was my 5th time  coming all the way from Los Angeles just for the event! I took roughly 3 000 pictures  and a few hundred from the Naked Race. So if you were in it and want to see your pics  drop me a line and I will send you the link. Take care until next year! Thanks again! TAK!,0

hello to all the above is not a criticism of roskilde festival but simply an observation and are now a roskilde festival to life  largest humanitarian organization certainly from 1971 to date  hopefully. For several years I sato in roskilde as promoter   but I can not understand a thing as ever  the entrance ticket to roskilde has become so expensive expensive. It seems appropriate to say that many young people from southern Italy would come to this great event  ROSKILDE  only one trip and all and admission is so expensive. It is believed to understand the cost of everything and the organization that I have been present for several years  but a suggestion for a future perhaps for the organizers present  you give chance to young people to follow your project unique and internationally.,0
my guess is that Rikke Øxner & co's reaction to these two bands is something along the lines of  who O_o ?,0

Carl Fischer.  Data di fondazione: 28 giugno 1971 In Roskilde Inspired by the earliest festivals and youth gatherings  such as Newport  Isle of Wight  Woodstock and Thy  the festival wave hit Denmark in 1971.  Early that summer  festivals were held in Randers  Nyborg and Hillerød and in late August  SOUND FESTIVAL  took place in Roskilde – an event characterised by bad management but great enthusiasm. The 1971 festival had one stage and featured approximately 20 bands. For 2 days the festival drew a crowd of approximately 10 000 per day.  The first Roskilde Festival offered a little bit of everything – folk  jazz  rock and pop music. The organisers were two high school students  Mogens Sandfær and Jesper Switzer Møller (earlier Magnussen) plus the promoter  Carl Fischer.  After the festival  there was a lot of cleaning up and many accounts to settle. Carl Fischer  who had taken care of accounts and money  declared the festival safe empty  and Mogens and Jesper ended up paying all remaining bills out of their own purse. Carl Fischer left Denmark shortly thereafter!  The two high school boys had not in their wildest dreams imagined that they had started a grand festival tradition in Roskilde. ,0

What was your best concert at Roskilde 2014?  Here's a variety of live shots from the past week. Miss it already!,4
Damon Albarn. No doubt.,0
Jack White and Mogwai,0
Psyched Up Janis! Arctic Monkeys! Les Claypool!,0
Tie between Rolling Stones and Jack White,0
Kasabian. Only a shame that it wasn't longer,0
Damon Albarn and The Heavy Seas!!!! You can't do better than those guys!!!!!,0
Damon Albarn and Moderat,0
Kasabian  a shame it wasn't longer  don't pack the schedule that much another time. :),0
Fire! Orchestra. Without a doubt.,0
les claypool. insane atmosphere. Deftones energi. And Dr Phil Anseloms hardnes. Great day.,0
Bastille  without a doubt!!!,0
Seeed and Jack White!,0
Cancer and Jack White,0
Hellhorse vs. The psyke project  which was a great idea  that got executed perfectly! I loved it  eventhough I had never heard any of the bands before the concert  and that is for me the true roskilde experience! To be blown away by some new music rather than just watch all the bands you are already a fan of..,0
Mogwai! They were magical! <3,0
Stevie Wonder and Seeed! ,0
Rob Zombie without a doubt. Outkast were also really good though :),0
The Legend: Stevie Wonder.,0
very nice pictures!,0
Bastille! :D,0
MØ! <3 She was no less than amazing. I was so moved by her and the great band. It was a beautiful and wild concert! Thank you Roskilde Festival and thank you MØ. I love you both  dearly! <3,0
I liked The Stones for nostalgia and Jack White for giving the best concert.. Major Lazer wasn't that bad a party either...,0
Les Claypool´s Duo De Twang  Hymns from Nineveh and Mogwai,0
Rolling Stones and Kasabian  but I need to set in Denai Moore as well  cool concerts,0
Electric Wizard and Rob Zombie fucking nailed it!,0
Future Islands and Moderat,0
But if we're talking crowd quality  it was Systema Solar hands down.,0
Julia Holter - although we almost melted away in the Gloria heat.,0
Bottled In England and We Are The Way For The Cosmos To Know Itself :),0
mogwai and slowdive,0
Future Islands and Kasabian,0
Major Lazer!!! and Stevie Wonder <3,0
The stones.. Nostaltic childhood memory in real life.. YAY :D,0
Spids Nøgenhat. And Damon Albarn. And Psyched Up Janis,0
Slowdive or  surprisingly  Jack White. Well done  Roskilde!,0
Oh man  most difficult question of the year. Darkside  Hookworms  Slowdive  Julia Holter ... but Stevie Wonder probably gets my vote by the smallest possible notch.,0
I hope someone official will answer my question: How come there has been no orange-press rating and no official photos of this year’s Seeed show at Orange? As far as I remember it is the only show at orange that hasn’t been rated  so I am wondering why that is so? For me it was one of the greatest acts on Orange this year  and reading official ratings of the shows I have been to was one of the main reasons why I looked for the newspapers. Seeed managed to put on a great party at Orange  and as far as I could see a lot of people gathered around the stage during their concert  surely because they enjoyed the show as much as I did. So why not give Seeed some credit for that? Or maybe I have just overlooked the pictures and ratings  in that case  where can I find them?,0
Outcast  but it would have been Damon Albarn  if the lack of security for the pit hadn't destroyed half the concert and my back...,0
Stones - to the bones!,0
Manu Chao and Icona POP,0
It's harder than usual to pick one clear cut winner concert this year because there were so many amazing musical experiences. But I'd say it's a tie between Manu Chao and Jack White. Close runner ups are: Seeed  Les Claypool's duo the twang  Bombus and Omar Souleyman. honorary mentions to Rolling Stones (for the legendary status and still rocking hard at 70+)  Major Lazer (huge party) and Toumani and Sidiki Disbaté (spellbindingly beautiful as expected). Overall this was a great year in RF history.,0
Kasabian! Too bad they only got to play 1 hour!,0
Future Island and Stones,0
I think that Major Lazer was the best party at RF! But the best concert must be  Stones or Stevie!,0
It is hard just picking one  since i heard so much different this year. Arctic Monkeys was a magical and truely amazing experience  they lived up to all of my expectations and more.  Future Islands were a huge and amazing party  if it wasn't for a lot of drunk people destroying others concert. Mogwai were undescribable  it was so beautiful - and Major Lazer wasn't much of a concert  it was an insane party  it was great!,0

Dear Roskilde Festival  First of  thank you for at great festival and the nice weather!!  I do  however  have a chip that I need to get of my shoulder  that I REALLY hope you take into consideration for next year and beyond.  Saturday at 6pm  Avalon housed the fantastic Helhorse vs Psyke Project show. It was one of the most intense shows of roskilde AND intense shows these bands have ever played. The tent was packed  the bands were having a great time and the audience was having a great time. EVERYBODY was enjoying themselves!!  BUT THEN  for some reason  around 2/3 into the show  someone from the Avalon crew decided that things were perhaps a little to intense and sent  crowd safety/security  out into the pit and tried to stop the moshpit. You kept pulling at people  who were having a GOOD TIME  telling them to stop. Anyone who has but a passing interest in hard rock and metal  knows what a moshpit is. People bang around and into each other  but still look out for anyone who falls and hug and shake hands between songs. Sure  sometimes  a bloody nose and a swollen eye shows up  but those are wounds that those fans gladly wear!! EVERYBODY with the slightest knowledge of the genre knows this  yet you for some reason either don't understand or respect that.  What you did was SO disrespectful  not only to the paying audience  but extremely disrespectful to the bands!! Here were two of the best  danish metal acts  playing their hearts out to to their fans  using every ounce of energy they had and the sight that greeted them  was Roskilde Security telling people in front  to stand still. Crowd energy is a vital part of shows like this and you chose to try and put a damper on it?? It was so obviously frustrating the people in the pit  how do you think it was effecting the bands??  Why do you do this?? I mean  is it so hard to do a little research into the culture of the different music genres playing?? And  even if you dont understand  why can't you just accept it? All you need to do  is take one look at Copenhell  were moshing is as common as cold beer. If it's so hard for you to  get   why dont you send someone from your Security staff to Copenhell and see for yourself??  Luckily  at the very last song  your  security  left and the fans could to their thing  for the last minute  before the show ended. I KNOW that not everybody want's to mosh. But those that do  aren't bothering anybody. People at metal shows know how to act and where to stand  if they dont want to be banged around.  A few years ago  same thing happened at another metal show and I asked one of your security guys why. Like an automaton  he said it was because of the Pearl Jam show of 2000. I really  REALLY hope that you aren't using such a massive tragedy  as an excuse for not even trying to understand s subculture  that had absolutely nothing to do with the death of those poor people.  You should ask yourself  WHY you book these bands? For who's sake is it  that you have metal bands in the line-up? Because  you actions certainly doesn't look like you're doing it for the fans.....,0
Nothing like bring in your birthday to the Stones!!,0
Hi Kristian 'Joan'! The winners will be announced on 5 April. They will know a wee bit before that :),0
50 DAYS TO GO!,150
Listen to James Blake and win a ticket!  It’s nice to wake up to a brand-new James Blake album. “The Colour in Anything” is available right now. Let us know which song off the new album you're looking most forward to hearing live when James Blake plays a special late-night show at Roskilde 2016. We'll draw a lucky winner of a Roskilde Festival ticket among all answers.  EDIT: Thanks for all your thoughts and song picks. Let's hope mr. James Blake reads this. And congrats to Pia Damgaard  you won yourself a ticket.,2
Half passed dead - though only 100 working hours this year! Wouldn't know how to summer without roskilde! Love you all  and see you next year!,0
Night falls over the last day of Roskilde 2014. Fortunately we still have some amazing acts left! What's been your favorite this far?,4
The ocean,0
ocean was great. never herd them before.,0
Yes  from entrances east and west,0
Takker (y) Hvilke tidspunkter i timen ? :),0
hopefully :D,0
Tak! :D,0
Can't wait? Neither can we. Follow the link and read about some of the projects we're working on for Roskilde 2012. Let's hear some comments as well.,14
Garbage bins are not the reason why I look forward to Roskilde. But it is very nice indeed that the number of them is increased :),0
Rie  point taken. But we all appreciate a cleaner campsite  right?,0
Yes  we do! I even requested rubbish bins when you asked for feed-back after the last festival  - so I feel like I've been heard and that is great :) I hope you've also figured out a way to prevent people from taking a dump by the fences. That was truly gross...,0
Looking forward to hearing more about this Dream City. Very interesting idea  Roskilde! Nice going,0
Rie  it's difficult to prevent mindless people from doing mindless things.,0
We're ready with something soon,0
Today  tomorrow  this week... or what? :-),0
This week :-),0
Any teasers? Like the wednesday-releases. When will they start?,0
We'll cook up some great teasers later. Not this time around  though.,0
I'll look forward to that!,0
Booyah! Finally a new single from Red Hot Chili Peppers.  How many ?? do you rate this with?,18

That was actually sick. Loved it,0
Taggar tuborg o små sure  ),0
done heard it.. pretty sweet!!!,0
Hvem har ansvar for lyden til Stevie Wonders koncert? Turn up the volumen we cannot hear the music at all! Aaaaarrrrgggggg!!!!!! NU for pokker!,0
It's Stevie Wonder's sound guy who decides the volume. Hope you enjoyed the show  nonetheless.,0
Thats a shame...... I could hear everyone in a radius of 10 meters around talking like as if we were at a dinnerparty. I have never tried that before on Orange stage.  Never seen a concert on Orange without my earplugs  but yesterday they stayed in my bag. Anyway I just felt sad and sorry for Stevie cause lots of his close fans could not hear him in the back and in the middle. But thanks for an amazing festival! Woke up in utter joy! ??,0
Stevie Wonders concert will not be live streamed,0
Is there any way to stream the Jack White concert later?,0
We will stream the concert here on our facebook. So stay tuned!,0
Missed the first half of Deerhunter anyone know if there is anywhere of watching it back?,0
Unfortunately not  but we hope you enjoyed the second half as much as we did.,0
Ok no problem just discovered your FB page today obviously through the Deerhunter link will definatley follow and look out for the great live music. Cheers!,0
Danish singer MØ has charmed fans all over the world with her street-wise electronic pop. Do not miss her concert at 18:30  where she performs at the Arena stage. If you can’t make it  be sure to check out the live stream.,2
Livestream does not work,0
Will you upload the Deftones performance somewhere? I missed it so I'm kind of gutted.,0
In two months it'll be Sunday. Sunday 3 July. Some of us might be a bit tired  maybe even a bit hungover. The Post-Roskilde Blues might start to kick in.   But we'll all have that very special feeling in our bodies. A feeling quite unlike anything else. The feeling you get after spending 8 days with more than 130 000 people. With sore feet from all the concerts and parties we've been to. And a happy heart from spending time with all of the friends you brought with you - and all of the new friends you met.   We simply can't wait to spend Roskilde Festival 2016 with you guys. YOU make it the best festival in the World!  Photo: Khahn Gia,8

Dockville: 16 new acts beside Tocotronic - tomorrow - 10.01. - 6 pm - on Facebook.,0
Bring the beat back!,0
Heading back to the real world today?  Busses from Entrance East and Maglegårdsvej run directly to Roskilde Station and Copenhagen all night. After the last concert at Orange Stage  the trains run all night from Entrance Platform to Copenhagen.  Going to Jutland? Then catch the train from Entrance Platform at 1:31  02:36 & 04:26.   More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c28717 (Photo: Michael Saly),9
No way! Im staying forever!,0
We strongly recommend everybody heading to and from the festival to use public transport!   Long queues are blocking the highways.  If you're waiting for someone to pick you up - consider taking the festival-train to Roskilde main station  and go from there.,0
So am I correct in saying that the trains are running all night to Copenhagen? If I wanted to get a train at approx 7am tomorrow that would work?,0
How are the prices. Is it a normal prices og can i buy festival ticket,0
I ment train and bus tickets,0
I already miss it?,0
Oh how I miss Copenhagen,0
Screw the environment. I got i friend to pick me up in his car. Never going through that roskilde train hell again..  when is DSB going to put extra carts onthe train during roskilde???,0
Hi! Can you please tell me if I can pay for drinks and stuff with my credit card at the festival?,0
Probably won't happen  precisely because of Northside. The major Danish festivals very rarely share their bigger names.,0
Maybe Roskilde could make an exception with this name.. It has been a long time since they have been on tour in Europe during the festival season  and it would call back a lot of people from  the old Indie-crowd  that have made their complains about Rihanna etc.,0
Then again that crowd just got Thurston Moore to sate their appetite. Let's see.,0
Sure Thurston Moore is a great name and no doubt it would have had a massive effect if he brought with him Sonic Youth! But.. Not that I am complaining  Modest Mouse has a bigger crowd  than a one-album constitution.. Although I am looking very much forward to see Chelsea Light Moving as well.. Let's see.. I hope my band-wish will come true..,0
its not up to roskilde  now northside has booked them  they've probably made a contract which states that they are not allowed to play another gig in they country within a certain time period.,0
Does contracts like that actually exist  or is it something you assume?,0
Roskilde Festival:  We are using a new app system  which has caused a little trouble. We are working hard to fix it. The finalists will be posted on Friday. Sorry for the trouble.  19 hours ago,0
Chelsea Light Moving join the Roskilde Festival 2013 line-up.  Chelsea Light Moving is sure to please old fans in worn out Sonic Youth T-shirts. But Thurston Moores's new line-up might also lure a new generation into noise  punk and New York City.   Chelsea Light Moving conclude today's additions to the line-up. Earlier today we also added Uncle Acid and the deadbeats  Nazoranai and The Sword.,7
Why don´t you move Roskilde Festival to Gothenburg? :-),0
Where's The Chap? ok i'll stop now,0
Firelances of the Ancient Hyperzephyrians <3 <3,0
Is this Thurston Moore? It sure sound like him  at least.,0
Simen: It is.,0
UNCLE ACID & THE DEADBEATS <3,0
This man got a point! Dirty Old Town should play at this years festival!,0
You should get MUSE for Roskilde 2013! Could be awesome!,0
rage against the machine..?,0
no no,0
The Sword will play Roskilde Festival 2013.  These hard rockers from Austin  Texas have a tight grip on the virtues of classic hard rock.  Today we have also announced Uncle Acid and the deadbeats and Nazoranai to the Roskilde 2013 line-up. At 12 we announce the last band of today.,18
Is it impossible to get a decent EDM name  you haven't had one since 2011. C'mon.,0
We also add Nazoranai to the Roskilde Festival 2013 line-up.  Nazoranai take you on a trip to the furthest corners of the mind with their experimenting doom  filled with disturbed vocals and massive doses of darkness  Earlier today we also added Uncle Acid and the deadbeats to the line-up. Next band is announced at 11.,5

Dear Roskilde Festival. I'm going to volunteer this summer  but I would still like to buy an entrance booking ticket. Is it possible without buying a full festival ticket? :),0
Hi Anton Your volunteer wrtistband will grant you access to the waiting areas.,0
You guys are so creative - we wish we could use these emojis already!  But the emoji-competition is still running. Draw your best idea for an emoji that captures the orange feeling. 15 emojis will end up in our app and the best will win 2x festival tickets. Deadline is 11 May 10.00.   Send your emoji to competition@roskilde-festival.dk or post it here.,1
Due to a cancelled flight  we have had a minor change in the programme  meaning that A$AP FERG and THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER will switch places.  The updated programme for Avalon looks like this: 12:00 – SKAMBANKT 14:00 – ARTO LINDSAY BAND 16:00 – THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER 18:00 – A$AP FERG 20:00 – THE HORRORS,0

Hi Dear Roskilde Festival! Schedule this year is pretty good i would say  accept for one thing.. ODESZA and RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS are playing at the same time!? ?? Those two were on my  wish list  I sent last fall  and I couldn't be any happier when u announced they were playing. But now my world is filled with darkness. My two main acts collide and it hurts my feelings. It really hurts! ?? Is there any way possible u could reschedule this huge problem? ????  Lots of love! // Alexandra,0
Hi Alexandra We are not going to change that. We always do our best to create the schedule. It can be pretty hard to predict if people have favourite bands in completely different genres.,0
The specific setup has been approved. There are a large number of rules that are followed in order to secure a safe camping area. All use of open fire at the camping area is for instance prohibited. You can read more about camping safety at Roskilde Festival here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/camping_safety/#Jek6qBDPpom0464Z.97,0
No  I can't understand it.... in you safety descrition you write   he camping areas are divided into a number of squares  in which the tents can be placed as close as you wish    AS CLOSE AS YOU WISH  !!! Crazy !! so maby 20 tentst will blow up at once!! I have written to Roskilde firedepartement about itm and will hoperfully get an answer. These conditions would never be aloudon Tønder Festival where I work.,0
In 44 years there have never been any problems as far as I know. Its fine as is,0
Until it goes wrong...,0
They would need 1000 times bigger area to have 3m between tents.  It is not possible,0
No argument at all - all festivals i Denmark should obey the same ruels !!,0
Here's a selction of live shots from the many concerts at #rf14.,37
Will there be stream at somepoint?,0
No warm up concerts this year  but we'll stream some selected concerts here on Facebook from Arena and Orange Stage. Watch out for them!,0

No pictures from seeed???,0
Black pus :-D,0
Manu chao best so far. Amazing energy,0
missing les claypool here. so bad.,0
Kadri Ann Rebane I still kinda hate them for not having accepted my application but one day MAYBE...,0
Giselle  I know.. Well  would be better!!!,0
They usually stream some concerts at Arena.,0
I know but last year they did some of the warm up ones aswell??,0
will you stream Bastille? i want to watch them so bad.  ),0
Missing Roskilde this year? Don't worry  we got you covered! We'll stream the Bastille concert at 11pm right here on our Facebook app - enjoy!,0
Hi Charlotte. We didn't have a photographer down there. However  I found these great pics on Gaffa for you: http://gaffa.dk/Galleries/gallery/55672#/3,0
anyplace to find stream of manuchao ?,0
Roskilde Festival has become less dirty - read more about that and why '90s fashion is trending in today's Orange Press. ,7
2% or what?,0
We're proud of our festival guests as they in fact produce 73% less trash than the average dane. For more info and hard numbers read the whole article by following the link above.,0
The first year I went (2006) there was trash everywhere  people pissed anywhere and there was a general 'couldn't care less' attitude. I remember sitting next to a food stall near the orange stage and watching people drop litter on the ground  even though there was a litter bin a meter away. If you asked them why  they'd say  because it's a festival! . But since then  I've been to other festivals and seen how much cleaner they are. I think Roskilde is behind with the times in that respect  the audience have thought it's fine to litter for too long  forgetting the expense involved in cleaning up the mess. I'm glad to see the audience are cleaning up their act  literally!,0
Less trash?? Well  I'm damn glad I didn't attend until 2012 then. The amount of trash is staggering...,0
Ive been working in P this year  and i gotta say.. even tho there was trash everywhere  it was still not nearly as bad as last year..,0
I hate people peeing everywhere  not enough restrooms? Or people having a negative attitude towards going to them normal. There is  a need of a concious campaign  you cant sit down in shadows rest in a wall cause its all insane  theres no excuse for not walking a few meters to a toilet or even the trees have specially reserved for men peeing. I wish it could get fixed. And saying it smells bad. And its anti hygienic.,0
I lived in K this year  and that was really good  because there were a lot of trash bins and a truck came by nearly every day to pick it up. But I only saw trash bins around the toilets in P  and my friends there told me that they only got a bag for their trash the first and last day  and nobody came to pick it up. I know it's irritating that they don't just find a bin themselves  but there is only sp much you can ask drunk people to do. So please put up some more trash bins next year and please go around and help people find them,0
Roskilde Festival  will you upload Orange Press from Tuesday and Sunday as well? :-),0
Yeah it a lot cleaner this year,0
We asked some people around the festival site to stand on one leg and describe the new organic Tuborg RÅ with one word. Find out what they said and try Tuborg’s new organic festival beer yourself! The beer can be found in Tuborg's stands  and the price is the same as normal beer.,6
A small beer is 25 kr and a large one is 38 kr.,0
Uncle Acid and the deadbeats bring a a mixture of darkly psychedelic hard rock and heavy metal to the Roskilde 2013 line-up.  We'll return at 10 with more ass-kicking bands!,19
A Tribe Called Quest - PLIIIZZZZEEE!!!!,0
How is the T-shirt competition going? Wasn't it the 18th of march you would put up the finalists here on the page? ,0
Just to let you know your app is still not working when using Sony Xperia Z5  been like this since mid-march. When will you fix it?,0
Hi Jocke. We're working on it. Apparently there a quite a few issues with Xperia Z5,0
In 1992 Nirvana played their one and only gig at Roskilde Festival.   Bonus info: this was right after the Danes had won their one and only European Championship in football. “Congratulations on the… err … sports ” Cobain said from the stage.     Which debut show are you most excited about in this year’s line-up?,37
I can't even begin to imagine how awesome  emotional and memorable it would have been to see Nirvana and Pearl Jam the same day that Denmark won the European championship. Absolutely surreal.,0
Definately Future! That man is on another level,0
Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes!,0
Chvrches or Tenacious D.,0
It's a great concert! Especially Scoff  Stay Away and Swap Meet are great! :)   Well  congratulations on the sports contest that you won today   he said ??  Oh  and I hope that DR someday will air the entire concert  thanks!!!,0
It was a fantastic day  still have it in mind!,0
Love That quote xD,0
The Last Shadow Puppets,0
Damn i would have love to see that Live!,0
With that in mind... Will you be screening any of the Euro's this year?,0
AGE AGAINST THE Rage Against The Machine PLAYED!!!!! DUDE HOW DIDNT I KNOW??!?!?!??!?!,0
I was there and it was absolutte great :-),0
I cant wait too see Jack Black and kyle gass on the stage,0
Actually I think the line up this year is pretty lame  but I'm looking forward to a great festival anyway. Probably it's my taste in music that stands still.... some festivals got Radiohead along with your acts Tame Impala  Foals & RHCP  why o why couldn't they come to Roskilde ??,0
Gramatik on Apollo ????,0
Say what???  I would give my right arm to have seen that!!!! <3 Nirvana <3,0
Tenacious D!!!!!!!!!!! ????????????????????,0
This Concert was awesome! I'll always remember it??,0
Definitely ONDT BLOD  i think they will blow alot of minds and break alot of bones at this years festival.,0
I believe Ghost will definately send us from the pinnacle to the pit.   Also Tenacious D will surely rock our socks off.,0
I was there,0
1992 was the best line up ever in Roskilde .Ni prickade helt rätt det året.1995 likaså .Nu famlar ni.,0
I heard that the Roskilde show was one og nirvanas worst shows...,0
Best day ever! Pearl Jam  football and then Nirvana. Thanks for the reminder  such an epic day  fortunate to have been there.,0
We put safety first  which is why they would have stopped the mosh pit to avoid any  accidents.,0
We are a festival  which aims to make room for everybody: guards  metal fans and the newbies  who don't know the rules of the mosh pit. And please keep a decent tone. We just want everybody to have a good time.,0
With a traditional barn dance and plenty of hay  Camp Farmer Dating has conquered the title CAMP OF THE YEAR 2014! Congratulations!,7
Shame that two people are missing on the picture. Will other pictures be uploaded?  Love from #farmerdating,0
It is - but congratulations anyway! We will not upload more pictures  but there are loads to find on instagram.,0
buuuuuuu i wanna see the to missing boys in the picture,0
Sune Wagner holds the record for most concerts played at Roskilde Festival – ever! Yet this is Psyched Up Janis’ first visit in 15 years and they’re so excited about it that they decided to make a video on their way here! Catch the legendary duo at the Orange Stage at 5 pm or livestream the concert right here on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1lP8RA5,7
How many times has he played,0
That would be 15. with Psyched Up Janis  Ravonettes  Tremolo Beer Gut  and as a guest in Sort Sol and Niels Skousen's Band!,0
Tomorrow we announce more music for the Roskilde Festival 2013 line-up.  Here's a little clue!,18
well this is strange,0
The Killers,0
Luckily  Airbourne has more likes than the clue would suggest.,0
MBV  Nick Cave & the bad seeds?,0
I don' know but I hope as hell for Danzig and Doyle! At least they are American. Satanic (the statue) and Misfits (uncle fester).,0
Tendious D ?,0
ffs guys.. it says it have from no facebook site to 90.000likes here... so stop all the big names,0
with none to 90k likes. hmm only one i can think of is MiTiS,0
Grinderman for US/AU? ~75k likes on FB,0
AC/DC  Deftones and Tenatious D,0
The Sword who have already announced themselves are from the states and facebook likes at 88k.,0
PLEASE  the sword. HOPING SUNN O)),0
EMPIRE OF THE SUN?!,0
Atoms for peace got 90'000likes. Joey Waronker -USA  Flea - Australia  Mauro Refosco - Brazil and yorke and godrich -England... don't know about the pictures. perhaps the picture above has something to do with 'amok' their first album...,0
them crooked vultures,0
Australia/US/? Band might be Liars? 37k Likes.,0
Johnny Marr? Thinking of the jaguar,0
The sword and nick cave and the bad seeds,0
Tenacious D? :),0
my bloody valentine,0
Hopefully The Residents!,0
https://www.facebook.com/AdamGreenOfficial?fref=ts this guy. The top picture is Uncle Fester from the  Addams  Family  and him being green makes it Adam Green.,0
Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) plays/played that exact model (Fender Jazzmaster 1966),0
Hipster Roskilde  books bands that doesn't exist  ),0
...so did Henning Stærk  -),0
Just found out that Thurston Moore recently got his Jazzmaster '66 stolen. Maybe that's a good source for the teaser?,0
or. Iron Maiden!,0
OMG THERE'S A WHITE BACKGROUND! Then it must be The Beatles performing The White Album. MUST BE!!!!,0
My bloody valentine,0
Can't be worse than Rihanna,0
Fleetwood Mac  Green Day  Haim and David Howie.,0
a coincidence?,0
Axel - if you search that specific picture used in the teaser  you will find out that it's a 1966 jazzmaster and not a 1964,0
Rage Against The Machine..,0
The Sword  89k likes on FB. Make it happen! :-),0
The statue with the horns is a statue of the greek godess Athena in front of the parliament in Vienna. Athena is also known as Pallas. There is a british prog band called Pallas. Fits with the pic and the flag. Not sure about the horns,0
Thom Yorke with the jazzmaster seems like a good guess.  Yay! Atoms for Peace!,0
There's also an instrument called a  Vienna horn ... Just a thought :),0
Tame Impala has over 200k likes. Alas  can't be them.,0
Roskilde admin: Throw us a bone  how many bands is this? Three?,0
Anders - 4 :) Two americans  one british and one american/austrialian/unknown,0
And one picture for each band/artist,0
I like Alexander's guess. Anyone know any contemporary bands with Vienna Horns?,0
Thanks.  I don't get the Atoms for Peace link then  if the flags are supposed to represent nationalities. Atoms for Peace are British/American/Brazilian. Or just British/American  depending on how you cut it :)  The rightmost flag is USA/Australia/something-something  isn't it?,0
Flea is australian-born and Joey Waronker is american. ATOMS FOR PEACE!,0
Dammit. Atoms for Peace almost fits with the last flag. Thom Yorke - UK Flea - Australia (/USA) Neil Godrich - UK Joey Waronker - USA Mario Refosco - Brazil  It can't be both Brazil and UK for the last one.,0
Teis: That still doesn't account for Mauro Refosco. He's Brazilian.,0
or wait  maybe it can.. It didn't specifically say there was only one country left  though it intuitively seems like that.,0
AND Atoms for Peace has about 90k likes on facebook,0
Maybe the UK part of the Australian flag counts? A bit far out  but still..,0
It's my best guess :),0
Atoms for Peace are playing 6/7 in France  and 9/7 in Belgium  so they're in the area at just the right time. Seems like a pretty good guess. Maybe Roskilde just fucked up?,0
Alexander Aleg-One Kolby is right about the flags and the number of bands. It's USA/Australia/unknown and we will announce four bands tomorrow.,0
That guitar better be fu manchu,0
b-but...  atoms for peace...  _ ,0
Andreas: They rarely play Jazzmasters anymore  do they? The past few times I've seen them  they've all slung transparent Dan Armstrong axes.,0
Please give us Airbourne  they are from Australia and are awesome rock n roll band and they also new album out this year and going to tour europe and play some festivals :),0
Well  it seems like Atoms for Peace has lots of fans. dont get me wrong  but why? can someone please link at god song from them  because the ones I've heard  I dont find that good... I know everyone got different tastes and all that  but I am still curious :),0
Jagwar Ma! Jaguar + Australia + 7k fans,0
Could that be J Mascis' Jazzmaster?,0
hope its not as shitty as rihanna and kendrick lamar was ...,0
Just quit playing games and give us Tool :(,0
The Sword selfannounced! Woohoooooo!,0
maybe something norwegian black maybe? Ratm? besides  the horns on the figure match quite good at the horns on a real Impala,0
Since they usually release bands from the same genre  and it looks metal-ish  then the Fender guitar is a Jaguar. Could be the NWoBHM band  Jaguar. Last released an album in 2009. http://www.myspace.com/jaguaronline,0
i usually get one or two of these.. but i cant figure any out,0
As soon as it's not even more electronic musik! Get back to HAND MADE!,0
Iced Earth is an american heavy metal band and they have a song named Green Face  so it is probably them.,0
It's not AC/DC  coz Angus and Malcolm Young are from Scotland!,0
The Sword also have already announced they will play Roskilde Festival on 7th July.,0
And Snoop Dogg says he is returning to Copenhagen.,0
My Bloody Valentine maaaybe?,0
Ghost  mabye? they have 90k likes on Facebook.,0
Anyone figure out what that youtube screencap could be? Also isn't that Thurston Moore's stolen jazzmaster?,0
Ghost is from Sweden  Christer. :),0
Edvin: They're from UK/IE and have more likes than the teaser specifies.,0
First band is announced at 9. Stay tuned!,0
Magnus: I know  i was just Thinking they might fit in the question mark flag. :),0
Thanks for all the guesses. This was a tough one - we know.              The flags represent to American bands  one British and the last one is Nazoranai whose three members are Oren Ambarchi (Australia)  Stephen O'Malley (USA) and Keiji Haino (Japan). The first picture is Uncle Fester from Addams Family. We turned his head green since that is often the colour used to portrait acid in eg. cartoons - hence Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats. The second picture is - as some of you pointed out - a 1966 Fender Jazzmaster  which is Thurston Moore's prefered guitar. And indeed the guitar was stolen from him last year.,0
The third picture is a YouTube screendump of Nazoranai in concert. We added a bit of radial blurring to make it even more mystical. The last picture represents The Sword. It is a picture of Athena with horns on her forehead which refers to the song  The Horned Goddess  from The Sword's debut album  Age of Winters .,0

Saw a sign on the bridge from C to H  saying that Arctic Monkeys is cancelled  and Hampenberg would take over. Please tell me it's a Big fat Lie!,0
Get ready for some Swedish indie from power-diva  Jenny Wilson! At 4 pm  she will blow away the Arena Stage at Roskilde Festival. You can livestream the concert if you didn’t make it to the festival this year: http://bit.ly/1nGz02n,5

Action Bronson/Slayer/Gramatik - samtidig! + RHCP/Odesza - samtidig! OH NO! :(,0
some of all the goods bands are playing in arena should at be at orange -__-,0
Iris M. Madsen,0
As per usual I'm going to be doing a fair bit of running between stages this year. The start of the music program on Wednesday is particularly bad. Any news on when the three off-venue concerts with Khun Narin's Electric Phin Band will be?,0
Tom Duffy Nicholas Leo Koutsoukis Ben O'Donnell Jake Gerrard can't believe bring me the horizon are on at like 3 in the day,0
Roskilde Festival please say that your wednesday line up is in no way final because that would be fucking terrible. Odesza  wiz and red hot chilli peppers at the same time? Gramatik  Action bronson  slayer and vince staples all nearly at the same time? Who is in charge of planning your schedule??,0
Roskilde Festival also has the pleasure to announce 4 new acts for this year's line-up: hip hop legends House of Pain  Swedish extreme metal act Meshuggah  cosmic pop from Australia’s Methyl Ethel and British electronic party-starters NERO.,0
Roskilde Festival Quality Music goes beyond genre :D,0
Jaaa!  :D,0
https://youtu.be/WGoR1rsblxo,0
I think that Arena is a way better concert place than Orange. The party is fun at orange  but the sound and intensity is much better in arena. (As long as the tent is not ALL TOO packed) ??,0
Odesza and RHCP at the same time ??,0
Probably my biggest clash...,0
Expect them to be on three different days. More on that at a later point,0
Skepta 2:30 in the morning,0
In Denmark they don't have dinner until 1 anyway,0
Nero got added as well,0
Can't complain with that,0
Tsuder and tenacious clash,0
And never realised at the drive in is playing,0
Who's Tsuder?,0
If I'm being honest I don't know any of the aforementioned acts,0
Lay on the grass vibes,0
Tom fisher special those guys,0
How bout day one nothing like a bit of bring me the horizon before listening to the Syrian orchestra,0
Honestly who headbangs at 5:30 in the afternoon,0
I remember when Neil Young played at the same time as Nick Cave.  That was a tough decision to make.,0
Can we check out the Syrian orchestra one night,0
Gives u enough time to regain momentum for later,0
Syrian orchestra are only on one night,0
And they're with Damon Alburn - 1/2 of Gorillaz and member of Blur,0
And Gorillaz are debuting a new album this year so I wouldn't be surprised if the other half joins him on stage to do a Gorillaz set with the orchestra,0
I feel your pain,0
F* Red Hot and enjoy Odesza  ),0

Press play and see how you sounded last year. We need your singing voice again at #rf16. We’re doing another round of glorious sing-along sessions. Which songs should be included in 'The Roskilde Songbook' in 2016? We are looking for classics filled with emotions  easily identifiable and sing-along-able.  Based on your suggestions we'll create a festive  touching and versatile programme for the sing-along sessions at Gloria Stage on Thursday  Friday and Saturday mornings during the festival.,8
Should the songs be in English only or can they be in Danish too?,0
I  new  song to the Roskilde Songbook could be the very beautiful:  You got a friend  Carole King  and off cause the 3 sing-along hits the two last years:  Bridge over Troubled Water    We shall overcome   Wildflowers . I also liked  Little Boxes  and  Where Have All the Flowers Gone? . Thank you for this wonderful new tradition!!!! :-),0
Phil Collins - Can't stop loving you  Erik Koors,0
Well  tenacious d is already playing  so dont really need anything else,0
Stine Rye Pedersen Nicolai O'Livar Mørk,0
How exactly does it work? Can a member of the audience come on stage and sing a song  or is it a fixed singer?,0
Little Boxes was there? AWESOME :D,0
Lasse David Sand Østergaard It's been there since this concept was introduced :-) – it was originally only Pete Seeger songs in 2014. In 2015 they expanded the concept to include other songwriters' tunes.,0
Årg HE stemning ??,0
If you watch the video that shows you what it will be like - an accompanying band plays evergreens and the audience sings the words. The lyrics are projected onto a large screen. It's a wonderful experience and we cannot recommend it heavily enough.,0
I did already watch the video. I was hoping volunteers could be joining on stage  that it wasn't a fixed singer. Sort of like live karaoke. Could've been. Alas  I might still show up. :),0
Gud ja! I givet fald  bring it on!,0
Hi! I'm an exchange student studying at the University of Copenhagen - I'd like to volunteer at the festival this year  and I was wondering how to apply for a volunteering position! Thanks! ,0
GUYS! Get The Kooks They just returned from Australia at the time of Roskilde,0
Come on Roskilde! The festival is taking place in Denmark! We need a larger variation of beers!   2011 we could buy Jacobsen (Carlsberg group  just like Tuborg) which was nice  but nothing in 2012 (!).   I expect there to be a larger variety this summer! People need variation!,0
Who should play our upcoming stage  Pavilion Junior?  Recommend here: http://apps.facebook.com/roskilde_on_stage/  We asked some Roskilde-goers for their favourite upcoming bands.   The blog AllScandinavian recommends these acts: http://allscandinavian.com/8797/roskilde-festival-2013-you-really-should-book-these-bands/,10
Looking to see pics of the Ryley Walker Trio. They performed at the Gloria stage!!!! :D :D,0
The water in P  L and N is temporarily closed. We open up again as soon as possible. Please go to the next agora and get water.,2

Unfortunately that won’t be possible. The two GAT tent sizes are located separately  though in the same camping area (M). If you're a big camp  who would like to stay together  have a look at our Get A Camp tents.,0

VERY cool,0
Thank you ! =),0
I like it a lot! ,0
is there going to be more announcements for electronic names this year? ,0
There is still 16 Apollo Countdown acts left to be announced and if my calculations are correct there is still 7 acts left to be announced on the regular apollo stage.,0
And then we have the non danceable acts for Gloria and the bigger names for Arena and/or Orange.,0
Roskilde Festival music booker Peter Hvalkof gives the inside tour of today's exotic bookings.   Check out our blog www.orangepeeling.com,4
134 bands left to be somewhat more exact :),0
I was about to write that but it sounded a little bit nerdy that i had counted all the announcements so i just wrote 130. :-),0
We add Bombino to the Roskilde 2013 line-up.   Bombino plays desert blues. His raw and poetic guitar playing is like witnessing a West African Jimi Hendrix shrouded in desert clothes.  Bombino concludes today's additions to the Roskilde 2013 line-up alongside Kottarashky & The Rain Dogs  Meridian Brothers and Hoba Hoba Spirit (page officielle),6
And you are meaning what exactly.,0
Kasper: Who gives a shit who knows or doesn't know him? There's an entire album's worth of music above you can listen to.,0
He clearly expected artists from Niger being well known.,0
I saw him at Primavera sound festival last year  he's a damn good guitarist,0
Yes  Kasper. Who is 'dat'?   Could it be that you are refering to the Vietnamese/American stand-up comedian Dat Phan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dat_Phan)?,0
At Kasper Fuhs Bond ... thats one big reason why a lot of up and coming  talented artists get stuck because of festival organisers and people like you go around with that kind of attitude!  Its about time festivals around the world stop booking the same old classics/favorites for their festivals. Book ONE or two big headliners and fill the rest with up and coming world talent...  Kudos to Roskilde  RANT over,0
I have seen him play  he is very good. Hendrixs was also unknown at one time..,0
book those guys  they´re as unknown as most of your acts so far... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVfK6ie2tLc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWdzNstENc,0
Book Atoms For Peace and all is fine :),0
Yes!! I've been wanting to see Bombino for a while. Great album! THANK YOU ROSKILDE! And re  artists people insist on filing under  world music   why not bring back Yat-Kha? They were amazing last time. ,0
Meridian Brothers - yiiiir! Get your Salsa trousers and shoes on!,0
Fede bookinger! Især Kottarashky & The Rain Dogs!,0
Hopefully  we'll have something for you next week. From Roskilde Festival Twitter site. Maybe new bands in next week :),0
It always makes me happy when you book world music! Good job yet again with the bookings :-),0
Hoba Hoba Spirit (page officielle) will play Roskilde Festival 2013.   Hoba Hoba Spirit combine rock and the tones of ancient Morocco.   Earlier today we announced Kottarashky & The Rain Dogs and Meridian Brothers. At 12 we will announce the last band of today.,35
A new electronic stage = Paul Kalkbrenner at Roskilde Festival 2012.!! :-D http://soundcloud.com/aimnat/paul-kalkbrenner-essential-mix-sat-07-30-2011 ,0
Fans of electronic music will like this piece of news.,57
yes! this is good news :D,0
Just glade that it is at C aka a long way form where I will camp,0
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT!!!!1,0
Peter Hoffmeyer -> This just means more acts. It doesn't mean that we cut down on something else.,0
I love it! ,0
we are curious,0
René Brender Bigum  I'm not sure you're reading it right.,0
+1 for the initiative  -1 for the location (:,0
Lasse Bruce Porsgaard Dam  There will be plenty of rocking bands at Roskilde 2012 as well.,0
get some upcomming dubstep names on this scene!,0
?????? ???????  don't you mean locationS :-P,0
Lasse Bruce Porsgaard Dam  well  that's a matter of taste and opinion  right.,0
Why can't dubstep just die already... The last thing we need is more teenagers / spoiled brats polluting the campsite. It was enough of a Sunny Beach last summer - why don't you put a 3000-5000 capacity scene for up-and-coming metal and rock acts right in the middle of everything? I'd much rather listen to that than monotonous bass thumping at insane volume all day and night =/ Maybe us who still reminisce about the rock festival that once was are becoming dinosaurs in RF's book?,0
Morten Christensen  as stated above  this does not mean any less of all of the rest of the goodies. So  don't worry. there will be lots of rock as well.,0
Come on  Lasse. Turn that frown upside down.,0
Roskilde > Then please don't book a lot of boring indie music  and call it rock. Personally I would enjoy more progressive music. But I think the new stage is exciting as well.,0
im taking this is sort of a replacement for the OHOI funktion one setup that was present last year?,0
Go to another festival that plays 'your' then if the most awesome festival of them all doesn't cut it.,0
Lasse your the one killing the orange feeling. And ye VV. P i guess so making a scene like that mobile is very nice. The Ohoi stage was cool but camping next to it made the first 4 days of the festival pretty tough. Soo im looking forward to see how this one will be. And then a message to all the haters  Roskilde have never been an all rock and metal festival. There was a time when that kind of music was very popular and the program include more act from that genre. Times is changing eletronic music got more popular and because of that we're seeing more eletronic acts. Roskilde is still a place where you can meet alot of people with different styles which make it that awesome festival  alot of us love :D. And to the people who complain about too many teenagers at Roskilde ask yourself how old you were on your First Roskilde Festival.,0
Jonas Abrahamsen  you'll know when the schedule is out :-),0
how awesome is that?,0
Hope it is going to be Nice!!!,0
Christian Rasmussen  from Thursday 5 July the stage will be situated close to the skatepark. That's all I can tell you at the present time.,0
Roskilde Festival: Thanks. That sound fine with me (not that I have a say in the matter  but now you have my approval as well  heh)...I was just worried it might be placed near the windmill or something. We'll just camp in the bottom of C and everything will be fine. :),0
I can't really understand all the whine.. This contains a lot more electronic music and that's very good for all the electronic music freaks  and i think it will means a bit more of other genres on the other scenes  and i think you guys who complain like small kids should be glad on other peoples behalf.,0
You'll know when you see it :-P,0
Will we see new band today :) ?,0
Part 18 is now on youtube in 3D. Featuring One More Than 12 at OrangeCamp To turn off 3d  just press the 3d button.,0
Ready to see who’s playing when and where? We’re currently putting the final touches on what will become the band schedule. It’ll be available for public scrutinization on Thursday at noon. We’ll also add a few new acts to the line-up.,23
Mark Gimbo Daugaard -   We'll also add new acts to the line up   Forhåbentlig her der kommer lidt mere elektro?,0
Wow that's early! Awesome (Y),0

The construction has started!  Today the Dreamers started building their #RF16 camps in Dream City - Roskilde Festival.,6
Dear Roskilde Festival.  You've taken all my friends and I need them back. It's been almost a week now and I really miss them. And also  please bring them back in same condition as you got them.,0
We will do our best to bring them back in the same condition. You should join them for next year's festival.,0
Thanks. Sometimes all you need is 1890 kr. Take care.,0
Longing for summer....and Sleep ! ????,0
Can't wait to get home #RF16,0
In 1982 Bono flew over the crowd in front of the Orange Stage in a TV crane. Later  the U2 frontman has stated that he’s afraid of heights…   What is the most spectacular thing you’ve experienced at a Roskilde Festival concert?,4
Dave Grohl walking through the crowd  crawling on top of one of the large speakers in the middle of the crowd and continues playing his guitar. Roskilde 2005. My first Roskilde festival and to this day still one of the best concerts I've ever witnessed!,0
2008: The Streets. Mike Skinner had everybody at the Orange Stage jumping like mad!,0
We want U2 back to Roskilde!!!,0
When Bono i 1982  flew over the crowd in front of the Orange Stage in a TV crane. :-) I was there to here Mike Oldfield  but U2 was the big surprise. My first RF.,0
Forgot the band -Arena pit - huge water fight on a hot day followed by epic WhoMadeWho concert,0
I was there...,0
The whole tent doing the locomotion with Senor Coconut during the live rendition of his latin-Kraftwerk  We are the Robots   - a high-light of the concert was when a girl in the front row next to me wearing a tassel bra was invited up on the stage to shake her stuff with the band! :-D Good times in 2001! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr6KKMUxzF8,0
Prince... Need I say more....,0
Kenneth Herlin buying a round of drinks.,0
Neil Young in 2008 and Elvis Costello playing first an acoustic set and then a set with the band in 1993ish,0
I met a guy who handed me a vegemite sandwich,0
Waiting in 40 degree heat for rockstar Kendrick aye Phoebe Lynch-Grant,0
O fucking asis i 2009 Mark,0
1995  friday night  Seonaid O'Connor then The Cranberries then Oasis  all three simultaneously in the Arena tent! What a fucking night! Best friday night of my life. After Oasis it was up to Orange to see the Cure! If RF was a god  I'd be a religous fanatic! :),0
My brother getting so drunk he fell asleep outside of the tent early morning a sunny day in June 93. He woke up about 16.00. with his skin on his shoulders so burned he had great wounds. Certainly a hard hangover afterwards.,0
Cee-Lo Green took his glasses of  which he never does at concerts  because he has social anxiety  and feels his sunglasses are a shield between him and the world... A minor  but spectacular event,0
Here's a link that works http://roskil.de/Legends80s,0
Dave from Foo Fighters climbing the sound tower!,0
I was watching . Great nite. Stan,0
Red Warszawa celebrating Heavy Hennings 30th birthday by providing 3-4 kegs of strong beer to the public  handing it out by connecting hoses to the kegs and passing the hoses out to the audience. And Bruce Dickinson climbing the arch of Orange Stage. Think he has done that a couple of times.,0
2006 - Kaizers Orchestra makes the entire audience at the Orange stage turn around while changing a guitar string. It was beautiful.,0
Bruce dickinson climbing orange stage in 2003 during Brave New World though it wasn't planned!   And complaining about NOT being allowed to repeat the  stunt  in 2011! #ironmaiden,0
Listening to the entire album  Dark side of the moon  in surround sound on orange stage. The sound was so perfectly balanced that everything was audible but earplugs were not nessesary. And when a bit of the wall was played  many thousand voices yelled  Teacher leave them kids alone  but all you could hear was the liquid blanket of sound from the loudspeakers. Not even your own voice came through if you stood in the right place. Pure technically made magic. :),0
D.A.D closing Orange in 2000. Torches being passed around the crowd. There was a strange vibe in air the because of the tragic events that had happened early that week. But more than at any other time i felt that special orange feeling of community  respect for the person standing next too you and a sensation of no matter how horrible it was to loose those fine young men  the show must somehow go on.,0
Punks hurling bottles at Sex pistols in 1996.,0
Seeing Nirvana. And the 2000 Pearl Jam-consert  but in a tragic way. Velvet Underground reunion. And my favourite Neil Young gig of all time  with Booker T & the MG's.,0
Every Japanese  this far  concert  was exeptionel...they rule,0
One of my greatest memories  that describes the most of the amazing experiences ive had on Roskilde Festival  is a moment where an artist i wasn't familiar with at the moment  showed me what Roskilde is all about. I've heard he was a blues artist  but when Seasick Steve began to tell the story of  his life and bring me into his mind with a one-stringed guitar  i felt luck. This happened on my first festival in 2008 at the Pavillion stage. But that tent couldn't fit more than a third of the people watching the concert. Seasick Steve told how he thought there would come a hundred people to watch. And precisely that is what roskilde can do! Thanks for the good weeks we've  made together i'm looking forward to see you again in 2006!,0
The Echo and the Bunnymen their first show at Roskilde Was a kind of Gothic and amazed me.,0
We are so sad to hear about the death of Prince.   Rest in peace. We will always cherish that magic night back in 2010 when you graced our festival with your presence. Photo: Simon Wedege,246
Well that came out of nowhere!,0
So sad..,0
Up there with the best shows I've ever seen. I still often laugh at the memory of his long repetition of  we can't stop  we can't stop  we can't stop!  during Delirious. Rest in peace  Prince <3,0
Only Heaven with have a better festival than Roskilde Festival this year!,0
weren't we there? Alexei C Hansen Kristian Hoareau Foged,0
An unforgettable show. Best one ever <3,0
I Will never forget Amagerbio 2011 ??,0
That concert was magical!,0
We don't do this often (as in NEVER) but today the canopy changes its colour.,0
We were there Tony Withers,0
So thankful for that magic evening ??????????,0
Peter Vibing Carla Charlotte Prip and Simon Væth <3,0
Thank you for that magic night at Roskilde 2010 RIP,0
OMG!!! What chocking news!! :(,0
I respect the guy  but I didn't like the 2010 show at all. We ended up running away screaming as he butchered Nothing Compares 2 U. And that ½ hour gospel session?! He might have been good  but we still laugh over how much we hated it. Our loss I guess...,0
He played the same day as Motorhead ??,0
I actually never listened to Prince outside the hits but that show in 2010 is one of the best I've ever been to.,0
I was there for that magical night. The best musical experience I've ever had. Rest in peace you true legend ??,0
One of the best concerts ever.,0
a night to remember!! Jo Skeie,0
One of the best concerts i have ever been too  amazing musician  showman and soulman. So much feeling and joy steamed from that stage and in return the audience! Fuck man so sad ..,0
Bridget Taylor you lucky girl!,0
I was there and was so impressed by Prince. R.I.P,0
And it was a fab evening. R.I.P Prince,0
Thanks for booking him in 2010. It was the only time I got to see him. I´m a huge fan and that concert was very special for me. RIP,0
It was magic?? Best consert ever.,0
Was lucky to be there... ??,0
I was there. That's sick. Are they killing off the great talent one by one? Any thoughts?,0
That was a magic night! One of the greatest musical experiences of my life and nothing could beat celebrating the exact one year anniversary of meeting my then girlfriend (now wife)  while listening to Purple Rain and When Doves Cry! Rest in peace and thanks for all the great music Prince!,0
Sometimes it snows in april ????,0
So sad to hear ?? joined my very first Roskilde Festival just because of you and seen you 2times later in DK. Loved your performance  will forever love your songs-RIP,0
http://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y,0
Wolfpack will always remember that concert!,0
Went to see Prince with my late beloved sister in law in Birmingham. One of the greatest performers I have ever seen. Listening to Purple Rain. ?? We have lost a true genius.,0
One of the top 3 concerts  in my 23 years at the fesitval,0
I remember that concert very well. Motörhead performed that year  too. Two legends gone!,0
Party like its 1999!,0
Another icon another part of my musical heritage gone who remembers purple rain and 1999 memories eh!  Rip little man!,0
RIP Prince?? thanks for the magical night! Thankful for have that experience back in 2010????,0

THAT was THE night to remember- the king of music on stage and having all in the palm of his hand.  It was pure purble magic  Thank you for the music  PRINCE????,0
Rest in peace ? never have i felt the orange feeling stronger than in 2010 at your concert... Everone was so filled with harmony  love and happyness. One of the greatest ever!,0
He was a legend..,0
RIP Prince?? thanks for the magical night! Thankful for have that experience back in 2010????,0
Strange to learn that the legendary Prince passed away in his elevator. When I escorted him to his room  as the General Manager of The SAS Royal Hotel in Copenhagen in 1986  each time he would stand all curled up at the corner of the large service elevator  but offered us VIP seats to his concert. RIP.,0
That concert reached Sweden! I was in a big  dark swedish wood  my son at the festival. I had just gone to bed  when my son phoned me  he didn't say anything and I just heard Prince singing Purple Rain. My son knew that I love that song. I felt the vibes  I got so happy and I had goosespots all over. My son didn't say anything  but we were so strongly connectet. Thankyou to Prince and Malte Skjold Thomsen and Freja Agnete Thomsen. I will never forget this and I am so sorry that Prince died. R.I.P.,0
I was there. R.I.P,0
Usually you're pretty pissed off  when you're a music photographer and can't get close to the stage. But then you really dont experience the concert. Here I had the pleasure to experience a Prince concert  while working. What could have been better than that?,0
Great show. Sadly I had to leave little bit before the end  but that was amazing feeling too  leaving the Roskilde festival site tired yet happy   while listening to one of the most amazing guitar sounds in the world.,0
Amazing night. In my heart always x true legend,0
So great Engrish Riskilde,0
Do you have any date on when you will release the map for this years festival? Roskilde Festival,0
Sorry  not yet. We're still working on it.,0
We add Meridian Brothers to the Roskilde 2013 line-up.   Meridian Brothers do avantgarde pop based on Latin and tropical rhythms from their homeland Colombia.  Earlier today we announced Kottarashky & The Rain Dogs.  We'll be back at 11 with today's third announcement (of 4),2
and Trashtucada . The party concert from Spain!!,0
Holy shit! This is weird. Don´t know what I think about this yet. Kinda cool.,0
Another band that I never heard about  like 90% of this year's lineup...c' mon Roskilde....,0
Patricio Capella  you should see it as an opportunity to get to know some new music. That's a big part of what Roskilde is all about.,0
@Patricio Capella. I have discovered so many great bands that I didn't know of before I saw them at Roskilde. Especially in the  world music  genre. Last year I saw Danyèl Waro for the first time  and he was AMAZING!!! There might have only been 300-400 people at the show  but it was one of the biggest parties of Roskilde 2012. If you have curious mind for music  you might just see your future favourite band at this year's Roskilde Festival! http://youtu.be/HhlZE7gXmG4,0
What is this that people don´t get  there can´t be well known acts on Gloria and Pavillion  they are way to small for that and Roskilde  also have to announce names for these stages as well.,0
Kottarashky & The Rain Dogs are added to the Roskilde 2013 line-up.   They bring modern Balkan beats from the heart of Bulgaria  combining East European folk music  dub  funk and soul.  We'll be back at 10 with today's second announcement (of 4),31
I presume the Niger act will be Goldie?,0
Its not music that I like  but I think it is ok to book acts that are not so well known. The Blitz Ambassador played Roskilde Festival last year  they were not well known  but were great to watch and hear.,0
I hope The Knife is among them...,0
...and The National...,0
A Tribe Called Quest er i Europa i juli. Need i say more.!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
JAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! Book them!!!!!!!,0
We are a band from South Wales who would love to get over to Denmark to play for you guys..please check us out.,0
New bands in this week ?,0
In 1976 Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show performed the last 10 minutes of their show naked because it was too hot to play with clothes on.   What’s the weirdest thing you’ve seen at a Roskilde Festival concert?,14
Thinking of flying over on the 26th July but am aware that camping opens on the 25th. Does anyone have any advice on whether a group of 6 would still find a good camping spot if we arrived the day after camping opens? Thanks!!,0
Arcade Fire is touring  why do not book them? Pretty please????,0
Music  please! Yesterday  the festival site opened and got off to a turbulent yet wonderful start. ,19
Fuckin awesome last night. Thank you Roskilde!,0
If your sons are at the festival site they might encounter some problems with the signal. We recommend that you write them an SMS so they will receive it once they’re in an area with signal again. If you’re writing from an iPhone avoid sending an imessage as it requires data.,0
Thanks for your quick answer  I'll keep my fingers crossed :),0
I know Roskilde officially doesn't show anything of the world up  but are there stands in the festival area who do?,0
Not that we no of,0
ucr on maglegårdsvej 8-10 shows games tonight on tv and there is beer  coffee etc for sale. not the same as big screen with all the rf people but one option about 700 from orange scene  more options here (in comments): https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vi-vil-se-VM-p%C3%A5-Roskilde/325701294250419?fref=ts,0
When is the final lineup/poster released? ,0
18 April. That's when we release the poster and 95% (approximately) of the lineup,0
You can't buy access to the campsite alone. You can either buy a Full Festival Ticket  which gives you access to all days  or you can buy a one-day ticket for Thursday  Friday  Saturday or Sunday (4-7 July),0
Bummer  but thank you for the quick response.,0
Happy new year! Any teasers this week? ,0
Deadly Tide Presskit- pictures  songs  bio and more ,0
Any chance of Deftones' gig being streamed on the net or radio etc??,0
Deftones' concert will be streamed and can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/orangefeeling/app_463285837148369,0
You can buy pavilions in Spejder Sport at the City Centres of the camp sites.,0
Part 17 of the footahe from 2011 ! featuring One More Than 12 at OrangeCamp ! ( just turn off the 3d by hitting the 3d buttion ) :P,0
Courage My Love can get this cool people to Roskilde? they are  so cool ,0
The next part of the Roskilde - Experience video segments is One More Than 12 @ OrangeCamp . :),0
Can we get SKRILLEX to Roskilde?! That would be amaaaazing!! WHAT A PARTY! (And Avicii) =)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cXDgFwE13g  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4n76ti3Xs,0
Hi Roskilde. After the misunderstandings with Fatboy Slim I would like you to clarify today's question 2. Are we to count all concerts with the band or just those where the guitarist/vocalist was part of it ?,0
What happens when you put iconic architecture into a festival setting and put them to a completely different use?  World renowned artist group  SUPERFLEX  has taken that challenge and at #RF16 their Flagship Shelters/Bottle Collectors VIP will grace the festival. The shelters are copies of flagship stores of major fashion brands. At the festival the shelters will be VIP lounges for bottle collectors.,3
If I pay for a Silent & Clean pre-access  will a spot be reserved for me even though I arrive later in the week  or is it strictly only to get early-bird spots on the 25th?  Thanx!,0
Tomorrow we'll announce the first artists for the 2016 Art Programme at Roskilde Festival.   Until then  here's a throwback to some of the art projects that have graced our festival the last few years.,4
Roskildes to smukkeste drenge :*,0
What concert is this? :),0
The Neighbourhood  please!,0
How come I just bought tickets to Denmark's biggest festival and New Politics aren't in the line up?  How about a little national pride?,0
Will you have a foosball competition this spring as well? Missed out on it last year and was so disappointed. Would be great fun!!,0
Please get Richard Ashcroft to Roskilde  he is excellent on stage and gave one of the best shows ever at Glastonbury,0
Can you please book Deftones? That would be awesome!,0
Who's your favourite act in the Roskilde Festival 2016 line-up?  Check out our Spotify playlist and listen to all the acts playing. You might just find your new favourite act in there.,1
Danni Peng Li they made the playlist for us!,0
Haha i know! I've already downloaded it ??,0
Hahahaha They said 2016. Not 2000 haha,0
Why are all the huge rap artists Rap Music on the same day - Friday?? It was the same problem Last year. They should be more spread out as this is just really unfair.,0
Not all the huge hiphop acts are playing Friday  there's a lot of hiphop the other days as well. But we follow your point. We're not trying to be unfair. Most artists have tight schedules and sometimes they decide the day - not us. And since we've got a lot of great hiphop acts this year  some of them have to play the same day.,0
Fair enough  just hope you will take this into consideration of the planning next year.,0
http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/van-halen-to-tour-europe-this-year/ Get Van Halen to play Roskilde please ?,0
Tomorrow we announce music from parts of the globe you don't usually see represented at music festivals. Some call it world music.  Here's a clue as to what we present tomorrow.,6
http://tour.nin.com/ Yes  I know - Japan end July and then UK + Germany in August. But maybe they will be in Europe June + July  then Japan then back to Europe?! :D,0
We know Christmas is all over  but it was good times and great volunteers. See for yourself. And have a happy new year soon.,8
Last Christmas day in Iceland is 6 january  so Christmas is not over yet :),0
Here is part 16 of the Rosilde Experience 2011 3D footage. This time Camp Ballroom has a chipndales striptease as well as a twin teeze. Check it out !  Subscribe for more videos. ( 10 hours total from 2011.. lots more to come! ) To turn off 3d  just press the red 3d button at the botton of the page on youtube.,0
Will we get more bands before the new year :) ?,0
Where's Roskilde Fest?,0
I see it!,0
What year?,0
is it possible to buy the partout ticket now and get an entrance booking exclusively? 'cause I really want to buy the ticket soon  but my friends and I haven't decided where to stay yet.,0
or is it  like last year  possible to change your entrance booking whenever you want?,0
Yes  it's possible. But then you have to pay a small fee of 20 DKK for the entrance booking.,0
Will the 'Get A Tent' be the same as the H&M Reboot camp? (With similar features...),0
Dream City Workshop #3 is just around the corner!  In the last two workshops ideas ranging from the very simple to the incredibly ambitious were exchanged  and a lot of projects and camps have already made their reservations for a spot in Dream City 2013. At Workshop #3 you too can pin your own camp or project to the Dream City map and learn how to get financial aid for your projects via the Dream City Grants.  Join the fun and send us an email at: dreamcity@roskilde-festival.dk or sign up via the Dream City Facebook event -> https://www.facebook.com/events/302776226518300/  The workshop is this Thursday (14 March) at 18.00-21.00 in Copenhagen and there is room for 50 participants (first-come  first-served).  ps. The first Dream City camps will be settling in at the festival grounds this week  more than 100 days before the festival officially opens. A bit crazy - stay tuned for pics :-),1
How do I book a place for a caravan?,0
Get A Tent Uptown add-on tickets are almost SOLD OUT.  If you fancy a pitched two-person tent  daily breakfast  hot showers  free mobile charging and Wi-Fi in an exclusive camping area north of Orange Stage  you'd better act fast.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/get-a-tent-uptown-almost-sold-out/,12
Didn't Flaming Lips also play in 1995? this guy have it listed at least (http://folk.uio.no/henrikb/uteliv/konsert/festivaler/sommer95/roskilde.html) and so does another source I have. Did they cancel or what?,0
Well spotted. They're on the poster at least. Dunno if they cancelled and rescheduled in 1996. It could look like it. It's rare that bands play Roskilde two years in a row.,0
Here's a selction of live shots from the many concerts at #rf14.,37
Will there be stream at somepoint?,0
No warm up concerts this year  but we'll stream some selected concerts here on Facebook from Arena and Orange Stage. Watch out for them!,0
My contribution #Thursday_night.,0

We want to see Blended Brew play this show!!,0
We have drawn the very last winner of our brand-new board game CAMP ROSKILDE - http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/the-sound-of-roskilde  And the winner is Håvard S. Berge. Congratulations!  But don't worry if you didn't win this time around - you can enter our music quiz throughout December for your chance to win a dream trip to Roskilde Festival 2012.  So keep on quizzing!,1
The answer to question number two in yesterday's quiz is wrong  isn't it? Norman Cook has performed not once on Roskilde  but twice. In 2004 as Fatboy Slim  but also in 1995 with the band Freak Power.,0
bon soir... 1 question my dear rf... when the festival opens  will there only be busses to entrance west and east? or will there also be bus to entrance south?,0
Yes I would also like to know it my dear Roskilde Festival.,0
Hi there! We are currently working on this. Stay tuned on our website http://roskilde-festival.dk/ :),0
Unfortunately you can’t change the picture one uploaded. But try to submit your band again and upload a new picture.,0
 In the late 80s this British DJ formed a band whose debut album included a number one hit which samples the bass line from a track by a famous British punk band. When did this band play at Roskilde?  - Do you mean the band formed by the British DJ or the British punk band?,0
question: Has Queen played on the festival? 'cause if you watch the first 14sec of the vid Somebody to love  you can see a large tent that resemples it,0
Hey.. look listen and book <3 :-) http://soundcloud.com/theweekndxo/sets/the-weeknd-house-of-balloons-1/,0
I once saw a video where it said how much the average festival goer spent  and how much alcohol was consumed and so on... does anyone know where to find this video?,0
Be nice to everyone  and bring back The Streets!,0

Can we stop plastic pollution at festivals? Please  Roskilde! Go ahead with sustainable drinking glasses and make a hughe difference!  http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/8203-8203-Glastonbury-Festival-2016-s-stainless/story-29110177-detail/story.html,0

Hi David  there are still one-day tickets left for Sunday. so you still have a chance.,0
Happy to help. Have a great festival!,0
We understand your fury – we are as disappointed as you are. But when looking for a replacement with such a short notice it is not always easy to get a name within the same genre. We still hope you will enjoy the festival and the other great names playing.,0
We understand that you are disappointed – so are we. But when looking for a replacement it is not always easy to get a name within the same genre. We still hope you will enjoy the festival and the other great names playing.,0
There are no set rules as to the length of the closing act but you can refer to this link for more info on the typical duration of concerts at Roskilde Festival: http://roskilde-festival.dk/dk/musik/om_programmet/#KX7FbLGAyjTuBQHv.97,0
Yes  there are still tickets for Sunday.,0
And not easy to get a MAJOR name like Jack White in 4 days time!! I am amazed and so sad that I am not at Roskilde this year. I am jealous of my friends who are there. You can't please everyone and I think you guys do an amazing job.,0
Life is too short to make a trouble out of little things,0
Going from Drake to Jack White is quite an upgrade...,0
Contact Drake for a refund. He should repay you for not showing up.,0

In 2016 we are introducing a brand-new stage - Countdown. During the first days of the festival Countdown will host a wide array of exciting upcoming electronic music. Come Wednesday the stage will transform into a portal that will be the entrance to the main festival site.,48
you mentioned that you had a couple of missing bookings. How about this!!!!! DAMN:  ,0
Back in 1971 the very first festival took place at Dyrskuepladsen in Roskilde. This is a picture of the stage at Sound Festival in 71. At Roskilde Festival 2016 we'll have 9 stages - and they all look pretty different from this one. Some will even look different from last year. More on that tomorrow.,8
The Roskilde Festival stages through the ages. There's been quite a few. Which is your all time favourite stage?  Soon we'll have an update for you on the stages at #RF16. Stay tuned!,2
Arena and Gloria.,0
I miss Yellow. That was the tent that later was relocated in the back of Orange Stage and became Odeon. But the placement when it was called Yellow was better.,0
The Gutter Island bar ??,0

Odeon and Arena,0
Odeon! Bring it back please. :),0

Will Warpaint's set be streamed?,0
We provide live streaming from selected concerts at Arena and Orange Stage and thus Warpaint's set will unfortunately not be streamed.,0
Hi Eva.  Every year  we work hard to make it as smooth as possible to get around on the festival. Security is our first priority  and this sometimes makes it a bit time-consuming  especially when there are concerts like the one with The Rolling Stones last night. When that many people are leaving at the same time  we cannot avoid bottleneck situations.   We hope you still had a great night  and hopefully you will not experience as much waiting time tonight.   Have fun  and take care of each other!,0

 You know I'd constantly been getting emails from producers being like I'd love to work on some tracks on your album. You know it's just people offering to do your job all the time and it's infuriating. Just let me do my fucking job.    Grimes – aka Claire Boucher – has travelled from underground to pop idol  while showing the world that pop stars can be producers too.,3
please for the next year Manuel Göttsching live on stage at Roskilde with his epic E2-E4 !!!,0
Wow  you have helped us generate DKK 17.4 million (EUR 2 335 570)  which is the total profit from Roskilde Festival 2015. Everything is to be donated to charity in full.

Hey Roskilde Festival Ticketmaster Danmark is bugged. I was able to buy 10 entrance tickets for West at 5dkk each right before I bought my RF'16 ticket separate. According to your page they should cost 40dkk unless you buy them with your ticket. You should probably look into fixing this or your info  as it's incorrect!  (Also please don't refund my entrance tickets  I'm going to offer them to camp members so we all get one in timely manner. Don't make me regret reporting this bug!),0
Just realized I've got a 21 year old rf-sweater on me?? - looking forward to this year's collection??,0
At the very bottom of the poster you’ll find the band Whitney. Riding on a massive wave of hype  they are just about ready to conquer the indie world.   The bookers simply fell in love with their soul-inspired country songs after a concert at the festival SXSW a few weeks ago. This made Whitney one of the last additions to this year’s line-up.,1

Hi Diana  The festival collects all the donated tents and hand them out to associations working with the homeless in Denmark and vulnerable groups in e.g. Africa  Belarus and Ukraine.

Could you please turn apollo down? Those subs are too loud for camping,0
Drake at Roskilde:  just hold on  we're going home ,0
This is what happy winners look like. Camp Ping Pong won today's Camp of the Year Competition. Congratulations!,5
Unfortunately  Chance The Rapper won't be able to perform at Roskilde Festival tonight due to illness. He was to play at the Avalon at 21:00. DJ Pelle Peter will play instead.,1
Simian Mobile Disco will play Roskilde Festival 2013.   The British electronic duo serves up a distillation of techno  acid house and bass.  Earlier we also announced Lemâitre  Gnucci  Carli and Eik.,27
Sweet as fuck  lineup keeps getting better with every announcement! Way to go Roskilde!,0
don't know them.,0
Fedt! :-) Way to go! :-),0
I like this  I like this alot!,0
missed out on earlier gig - can't wait! :),0
more announcements today?? :),0
Rögnvaldur No  Simian Mobile Disco concludes today's addition of electronic acts to the lineup.,0
ever heard of freedom of speach roskilde festival? sorry for having an opinion. Grow up young journalisto. bye bye!,0
Dom Rumble  what are referring to? We don't delete posts or comments unless they are hateful  attacking other people or advertisement.,0
You're not Daft Punk.,0
You're in the hot mix  baby!,0
Roskilde !  Can we get Submotion Orchestra to perform this year pleaseeeee !! Thank you ! still looking forward !,0
Today's Orange Press features an article on the six typical music personalities you could run into at Roskilde Festival. Which one are you?  You can also read about Lykke Li's love hate relationship with performing on stage. ,6
Roskilde  I have loved you for almost 20 years. But the toilet facilities have to improve. It's degrading for women and unacceptable. You are disrespecting 50% of your audience. 45 min in a queue is NOT okay. Sort it out!,0
I couldn't make it this year  so I have the festival blues... Are you streaming concerts to help relieve me of some of the pain from not being there in person? If the answer is yes: Link pls?  See you in person next year!,0
Have you removed agora/camp site B this year? It isn't on the waiting area map :(,0
I don't think it's any different from last year  where there were a few camping spaces north of Street City and the skate ramps called 'B'  but no agora or tower.,0
At 12.00 our bookers will be answering questions about the #RF16 line-up. So fire away...  EDIT:  Thank you for all the questions! The Q&A is over and the bookers have returned to their work.,2
Will members of Blur play with Damon Albarn? Big names going to play with him?,0
Why no Arcade Fire? :-(,0
why is my - insert random favorit band - not playing?,0
Why isn't Lukas Graham playing? :) Have you attempted to book him?,0
What made you book Tuskegee?! Literally my favorite booking ever.,0
Will there be more metal booked or have you given up on it after Metallica and the competition from Copenhell  as it seems?,0
how do you make sure your line up is different from other festivals when all the bands are playing several festivals in summer,0
When will the time schedule showing when bands are playing be revealed...? :-),0
Will BADBADNOTGOOD bring Ghostface Killah or some other rapper (DANNY BROWN :D )  or  Just  be a Jazz act?,0
Any possibilities we'll see more major acts announced later? Was really hoping for Lukas Graham to come play this year..,0
Will tool ever perform at the festival again ??,0
What booking are you most envious of  when looking at the other festivals in Denmark? :),0
Why didn't roskilde booked any EDM artist this year ?,0
Do you have a link to som more info/songs from the band Paper?,0
When will you stop lieing to your fans? Saying you take the younger generations wishes seriously  yet no big EDM names  a ton of bands all over 60+ years old  and 30 unknown retard-rock bands with like 20k views... And most of the electronic music you booked is unknown and impossible to dance to or anything,0
So really. What went wrong with the whole Radiohead-thing? Seemed like the need-to-have booking of 2016.,0
How come metal and rock fans get lots of  classics  in their genre and hip hop fans get none? There is a lot of kool hip hop on the poster this year but NO legends like Cypress Hill  Ice Cube  Big Daddy Kane  Rakim  Nas  Method Man & Redman (just to name a few out of a thousand). I'm just disappointed that the hip hop bookings aren't more diverse. There are four UK grime rappers  four pop-rappers (young thug  future  wiz  macklemore)  the rest are dope but also newcomers. WHERE IS THE GOLDEN AGE/OLD SCHOOL HIP HOP AT??,0
Scarlet pleasure på RF16  but why?,0
Where is the serious headliners?,0
Why did you not book Beach House and Wilco? It's been a long time since they visited Roskilde  both put new records out last year (Beach House especially made 2 great great records) and they are both class acts with a great back catalogue..,0
How do you pick the rising acts? Through watching them live?,0
Is it because of Vanguard Music Festival that you stopped booking 80's  90's and early 00's hip hop acts?  None this year  none last year  and the year before that  I think it was only Dilated Peoples?,0
Wheres all the night parties at apollo?! ....i cant seem to find any real  dakkedak  music... not that i really care that much  im just wondering.. since youre making apollo a  real  stage now,0
Are any of the 4 last-minute additions from the march 30th post accredited to the comments section of the post? Would be fun to know which bands were added so late and why,0
When do you announce the full schedule of the acts?,0
I was wondering  if you already are aware of  if an artist are bringing  featuring artists  on the stage ?  Is it something they will tell you when we get closer  do you already know  or are they just bringing them on the stage  only telling you on the day? :),0
Has the focus shifted on which names to book over the last  say 5-10 years  and if so  how?  Also  I don't expect an answer on this question  but how is the budget roughly divided between small  medium and large names (percentage wise)?,0
Why isnt EDM represented better? Of course we have James Blake  Odesza  Birdy Nam Nam  which is great! But I really think we're missing some bigger  party  oriented named this year,0
There's alot of concert i Denmark around june and july. Coldplay  Bruce Springsteen  Iron Maiden  Lukas Graham and many other major artist  how come RF didn't get the chance to book any of these artist? And will there be a surprise announcement in the  last minute  like Metallica 3years ago?,0
What´s the  thought process  when coming up with/inviting bands to play at roskilde? Are there any genre that your focus lean towards?,0
Hello Roskilde! I would just like an official answer on this. Is the reasion for no Eminem simply that he is too expensive? You must have looked into it  over all these years  and yet he hasn't been close once. We got him in Parken (HAH  tricked Denmark)  but could I have an official statement that he is too expensive? Can't see any other good reasons. Thank you very much and can't wait! :),0
Where you trying to book The Strokes or was that not possible this year? (Pleeeeease get them next year if you can! <3 )  Also  try looking into BØRNS 'til next year :-),0
How do you find all The small artists and bands to The program?,0
Is there a reason why you haven't booked a DJ like Martin Garrix  Afrojack  Hardwell  Oliver Heldens  Diplo  Deadmau5? The Major Lazer concert in 2014 was amazing for example. And which artists in the 2016 line-up  can you recommend for us who likes electronic music?,0
When do you expect the tickets to be sold out?,0
Have you considered or attempted to organise  album concerts  in which a band performs one of their albums in its entirety  e.g. Primal Scream performing Screamadelica. Would you be open to that sort of thing?,0
How are you feeling the pressure from other festivals like northside  tinderbox and copenhell? Because the program seems awfully flat this year. I know you will say the usual about the program  but come on. Surely Dizzy are only playing because you couldn't attract the artists you really wanted. So disregard the disappoiting outcome and tell me if you are feeling a bigger pressure with all these new genre specific festivals? Is it hard being a festival for everyone these days? Because you seem to be losing some ground in every genre.,0
Was there any act that was perticulary hard to get from the ones you manage to book?,0
What stage will Gojira be playing at? (hopefully Arena  that's my favorite),0
Wich stage are mac demarco playing on?,0
Roskilde Festival will Pizzagang play this year?,0
Will there be one or two additional announcement later on  as has been the case several times before?,0
What is the reasoning behind booking both LCD Soundsystem and New Order  seeing as the music is fairly similar?,0
Why is punk rock and hardcore again basically not represented in the lineup? With festivals like Groezrock and Punk Rock Holiday consistently booking an amazing lineup in these genres and attracting 15-30.000 people  why is Roskilde ignoring these genres?,0
Will you lift Bersærk into the main program?,0
Where are the big dj's. Maybe Ferry Corsten in arena.,0
Will we ever see Frank Ocean on the lineup? Have you had previous experience trying to book him or is it hopeless?,0
what stage will Future and Young Thug be playing on?,0
Are there a good chance that Biffy Clyro will play at Orange Stage? I think they are big enough :),0
There seems to be a lot of criticism about the lack of big EDM acts this year. What has your approach to the whole EDM wave been for the last couple of years  and what lessons have you learned? What did you make of the mixed reactions of booking Major Lazer  essentially a playback act  on the Orange stage?,0
Who will be closing Orange stage this year?,0
Roskilde Festival  is there a chance we'll see Pizzagang at the skaterscene this year?,0
Are Biffy Clyro headlining one of the stages?,0
What have been the worst or most surprising outcome of a booking in the past five years?,0
Are you going to book a big ska/ska-punk band at some point? :),0
Did you consider booking Trivium this year as they're on tour in Europe until the end of June?,0
Would you ever consider booking a band like MONTI?  FACEBOOK: https://m.facebook.com/montiofficialmusic/,0
How come that you found so many great names this year? I personally love the lineup  but many of my friends find it sad  that there aren't  Bigger  names this year....,0
Politiken's Simon Lund has criticized you for not having huge pop names like Drake  Rihanna  Kanye West  Justin Bieber or Adele. Are those acts you're interested in booking and what do you make of the critique that names along those lines are what you need to have 'gennemslagskraft'?,0
Will Bring Me The Horizon be playing at Orange?,0
What's the deal with D.A.D.? Why dont you book them  its been a while since they appeared on line-up  ten years. Is there some contract related problems or what? I have heard some rumours that you guys dont get along with each others? Well I hear lot of things so please feel free to shoot the rumours down. Greetings from Finland  see you at the summer  -),0
What about Foo Fighters? Did you try to book them  or didn't you think it was relevant this year?,0
When will the mysterious Dinner be ready for Roskilde festival? Or is Roskilde not ready for Dinner?,0
What day is lcd playing?,0
What about Kendrick Lamar? He was on your program earlier this year  but his gone now. What happened?,0
Why wasn't Radiohead available? Any chance for next year? ,0
First off  great job! Just wondering  did you attempt to get Travis Scott? :),0
Will the Tuborg Ghettoblaster tour the camping area again in 2016 with a similarly great dj lineup as last year?,0
Where do I find some more funky/disco music?  Gramatik is a fantastic booking  but funk  disco and funky electro is so hot out there. And people love it  they just don't know the artists.,0
When is the official schedule coming out? Would love to know when santigold are playing?,0
Roskilde Festival  any possibility that we are going to see Two Door Cinema Club or Cage The Elephant this year. Since they are on tour this summer and are going on several festivals?,0
what night are LCD playing . tak,0
Will LCD Soundsystem clash with New Order?,0
there has been som rather unfortunate clashes in my time as RF guest. Eg last years clash with obvious fan similarities in father john misty and ryan adams. Is this crowd control or just brain farts?,0
Can you guarantee good weather  great music  cold beer and sexy girls?,0
Will there be anything similar to Die Antowoord and Mayor laser. i think that we are missing a concert that can really throw a crazy party.,0
Any reason for not booking either Thee Oh Sees og Ty Segall (and the muggers)? It seems that both artists are playing one or more shows in europe at the time of the festival and they both released new insane stuff within the last year.,0
Thank you for all the questions! The Q&A is over and the bookers have returned to their work.,0
was hoping on  more artist like Tropkillaz or Diplo  is there still any possibilities?,0
How did ye miss out on the Puscifer booking?,0
Is there space for Chance the Rapper in the RF16 Line-up ?,0
How come the line ups are getting crappier and crappier every year?,0
No seriously   is there no Sunday this year?,0
I dont know if its too late to ask. But it seems that you have had at least one major hardcore electronic band to play every year at Orange stage. At least since i visited Roskilde for the first time. 2013: Chase & Status 2014: Major Lazer 2015: Die Antwoord I was kind of hoping for The Prodigy this year  as they are touring  and a roskilde gig would fit perfectly into their tour  but nevermind that. Have I missed anything? Have you booked a major electronic band this year  that I just havn´t heard of?,0
Very cool that you took Q & A.  Just another reason we at Camp Wolfpack skip Coachella our home festival for Roskilde Festival every year!!!  As a good friend sings..........  Roskilde Rulez  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcKKo-JKHeU,0
How much did Guns N Roses ask for? :),0
As a metalfan you can't cry over this years metal or hard rock line up.. It's the best in ages!  (you don't have to thank me for the list  ) )  Slayer (ny) Tenacious D At The Drive-In Bring Me The Horizon Dizzy Mizz Lizzy (ny) Ghost Gojira (ny) Kvelertak Sleep Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats (ny) Black Breath (ny) Blues Pills Cattle Decapitation Danko Jones (ny) Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes Halshug (ny) H09909 (beskrivelsen siger hiphop  liveshowet siger punk!) Letlive. Mutoid Man (ny) Rising (ny) Sumac (ny) Peaches (ny) So Pitted (ny) Tsjuder Bersærk ORM (ny) Ondt Blod (ny) Childrenn (ny),0
Would love to get this answered too - the currently hottest Danish band isn't booked? :(,0
Because - insert random festival act of same genre or Slayer - is better.,0
point taken :D,0
Given up? Gojira  Slayer  Kverlertak?,0
These are mediocre bookings at best  many small names  decimated Slayer  Tenacious D (who hasn't been relevant in ages imo)  BMTH hasn't either  and Dizzy isn't hard rock.. Gojira  Ghost and Slayer is the only proper bookings compared to the metal names they have pulled out beforehandedly. But hey  that's just my opinion  I think they have given a bit up  especially when you see who is touring.  I heard they really wanted Beyonce as well  that money could have been used a lot better  and have been  thankfully.,0
Oh god ... Not another discussion on what is  trve  metal ??,0
I'm sorry I put it that way  but I am talking about metal  as in thrash  heavy  power and so on  not hard rock :-),0
mediocre = just because you don't know the bands right  )? and BMTH has just released their best album to dato concerning reviews from the metalpress.,0
For anyone in doubt   mediocre  bookings just means whatever Mathias has decided that he doesn't likes. The metal lineup at Roskilde Festival this year is mighty impressive  especially if you like more than just doom and death which is basically all that's been booked the past couple years.,0
Not really  I know quite a lot of them to be honest :-) what my point is that I think they got destroyed by the booking-team at Copenhell. Should it be that way - now that metal have their own festival - that Roskilde shouldn't compete? I don't think so with the former bookings that I have witnessed.,0
They're playing at another danish festival. http://northside.dk/kunstnere/program/,0
Yep  I know  the question is more why they let them go to Northside.,0
Well  that is my opinion as I clearly stated  so anyone who can read and is blessed with the gift or right  could either disagree or agree with me. I'm just stating my opinion and asking the booking team.  - that is true though  it is much more diverse which is great !,0
Mathias Hansen Well.. Gojira  Ghost  Halshug and Blues Pills played Copenhell last year.. Now they are all playing Roskilde this year :) so I dont think you are right.. It's all about what you can get. Scorpions  King Diamond or Alice Cooper would never fitt into Roskilde as Roskilde is all about progression..,0
That's fair enough  I respect your opinion  I just disagree as well. That is the great thing this year  the diversity  but if Roskilde was all about progression  why would they book Kris Kristofferson  Bruce Springsteen (even though it was a great concert) or even Metallica/Maiden ?  Yeah especially there days where the money from record sales is plummeting  touring is beginning to look like the major income for artists  which should make the names available even bigger. I would love to see those you mention on Orange again..!,0
Sometimes you really have to look at the smaller names.. While Slayer  Kvelertak  Sleep  Gojira and Ghost are some of my all time favorites here  the bands I look forward to are mostly the smaller ones like Sumac  Black Breath and Mutoid Man.  They don't have to book more and bigger names  sometimes you just need to open up and try some of the smaller bands.,0
Mathias Hansen because The audience for those major old school Hard rock names is not there!   There is 14.000 people at Copenhell. It's less people than what the Arena stage can contain.  King Diamond  Alice or Scorpions could never draw a crowd of 60.000 people to The orange stage today.. Never..,0
I am definitely one of those people who try and listen to as much music as I possibly can  and open up to everything i can on the festival  personally I just miss an amazing booking.,0
Or Dr. Dre - with Eminem  Snoop and Kendrick ? There is a new album out  the movie  Straight out of Compton  and it all could lead to a west coast soul  funk and rap music orgy at Orange ...,0
Where was the crowd for Kris Kristofferson ? (I know it was a horrible booking  it just proves a point) they still put him on Orange which was an even bigger mistake. And to clear it up  yes  I attended the concert. But I think you're right   they wouldn't fill up Orange  but if you were there for Maiden  Metallica  Volbeat  Springsteen and even Slipknot  there were a lot of people  perhaps it was even filled up. I think there would be a pretty good crowd  because they're less mainstream  but is every single band on Orange mainstream throughout the history? No. I think they've neglected it a bit  and you don't  which I greatly respect and even though you said I shouldn't  thanks for an edited list ! Let's agree to disagree  and enjoy the music :-),0
Probably because he is playing 3 (i think) exclusive shows and have probably signed a contract saying he cant play more shows than that in Denmark,0
We will let you know more about the specific artists playing with Syrian National Orchestra and Damon later on...,0
Mathias Hansen   ) yes.. I've been to all Of The shows you mention.. And also to Mastodon and Machine Head in daylight in front of 0 people.. my personal favorit of 2016 is Tsjuder.. Pure raw and intens black metal from Norway. Loads of great music you need to listen to before The festival  ),0
Yes  there are some bands I don't know or have heard of  so those i will absolutely look into  that being one of them :-),0
Can't book them all.,0
What Kasper says,0
You could have not booked Neil Young... and got Arcade Fire instead..,0
Damn.. He would have been perfect for this years festival. :(,0
There will be a few more additions,0
And can you reveal when these will be? :),0
We dont see it as similar at all.,0
Not this year  sorry.,0
We will release this in the end of April.,0
What about at the skaterscene?,0
Roskilde Festival I surely hope that they are not playing at the same time!! I want to see both bands <3,0
We have tried a couple of times  but it hasn't been possible for him to come.,0
Still very excited with the lineup. Thanks for the anwser:),0
They're playing. That's the important thing,0
No headliners.,0
Exactly! I have pondered this very thing for a long time now. Has Eminem or Dre ever performed in Denmark before even? It would be such a shame if we never get to experience these legends on Orange Stage.,0
Can you at least tell us what you are considering?,0
Roskilde Festival   Did you push to become one of those three places mentioned by Kasper? i mean.. Rising international star from Denmark - that's a no brainer!,0
Nothing went wrong. They just decided early on not to do very many or very big festivals this year. Hopefully they will be back with a vengance in the future.,0
We would love to have Em and/or Dr. Dre  but it has not been possible so far. It's not just about money  they very rarely tour  especially in Europe.,0
No  it wasn't relevant for this year. Børns is on our  to watch  list.,0
EDM music havent been down our alley  as we cant have all music genres eventhough we do try. Major Lazer was a brilliant party in 2014  we know we wanted a party and we got it.,0
Not at all. I think we have a really great rock/metal program. Personally I'm looking forward to At The Drive-in  Cattle Decapitation  Blues Pills and of course Slayer. VH Stefan,0
There will not be a late headliner booking this year. As for the acts you mention  either they chose to play their own Stadium shows or we chose to go for some other acts this year. We can't have it all.,0
We cant book them all  sometimes its not about whether we want or not want but about touring period.,0
We didn't actively decide not to book hiphop from the 80's and 90's  there's just a lot happening with hiphop these years that we want to reflect as well  so that's what we have chosen to give the spots this year. But we may still have some of the legends in the years to come.,0
Is there any reasons EDM hasn't been down your alley this year? I'm interested because it seems like you have been focusing a lot on EDM for the past two years.,0
It actually varies a lot. Sometimes it's part of the negotiation from the very start  sometimes it comes up very close to the festival and in a very few  magic moment type shows  it just happens on the day without anyone planning it.,0
We spend a lot of time to visit a bunch of festivals all over the world  small as big ones. We have a great network and a brilliant audience who send us times year around.,0
Our experiences with these shows (we have been to quite a few) are not the greatest  they can tend to be a little too stiff as not many albums are made to be played live. But not ruling it out entirely.,0
Well  frankly that wasn't a question about this years line-up so excuse me my idiocy :-D,0
Glad you like the line-up. We are really happy about it as well.,0
Why not  we have all kind of music genres every year and we are totally sure that Scarlet Pleasure can pull it off.,0
We'll reveal the schedule in the end of April.,0
We are not a genre-specific festival as the ones you compare us to  so it's true that our selection of punk and hardcore is smaller  but we try to find some acts every year and focus mainly on those who can be seen as bridging the gap to other genres. That may seem like less punk  but it works quite well for us. What about: At the Drive-In  Savages  Diät  Ho99o9  So Pitted  Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes...,0
Yeah. We go to a lot of shows and listen to a lot of demos  eps etc.,0
We can't say yet.,0
We dont have that many DJs in our program in generel  but have a look at tomorrows big stars as DJ Paypal  Hayden James and Tuskegee. For other electronic acts go listen to Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith  Kuedo  Shades and Recondite.,0
They are not playing any shows at the moment.,0
We will reveal that when we reveal the schedule in the end of April.,0
They'll play Arena :-),0
Yes  the focus always shifts a little bit as we try to evolve with the music scene and our audience. Looking way back to the beginning it was more folk and roots oriented  then there was an era with more punk going into the grunge and metal heyday of the 90's. It's been much more diverse over the last 10-15 years and now a days we have a big representation of urban acts  some types of electronic music and pop in different shapes is more present at Roskilde. Can't give you any figures as to how we divide the budget  but we spend a lot more money on the medium and upcoming names than other festivals as this part of the line-up is very important to us.,0
You never know,0
We will let you know when we reveal the schedule in the end of April.,0
We've tried to get Grimes to play Roskilde for a while  so we're very happy that it happened for #RF16.,0
No - they'll deliver a killer show on the Rising stage,0
Could've  would've  should've...  -),0
What do you mean?,0
Yes. The same as last year.,0
So  eh  you guys are good here  right?,0
Nope  not in 2016,0
We can't say yet...,0
We have a consistent average age of 24 years and have had so for many years. If we had completely lost our touch with the sound of today  we would probably have lost our young audience too. The few acts we have over 60 are important to the music today and therefore relevant to us and our guests. As for the many many new and unknown acts we have  they are on an early stage in their career and we belive some of them have a great future ahead of them. And some of it you can even dance to!,0
Sure we do. Hit the play button here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/music/2016/paper,0
Wrong answer - but thank you  ),0
Envy is an ugly trait,0
Agreed about the genre festival  but you don't have to be a genre festival to book at least SOME names in this category. I was hoping for maybe 10 bands out of the 167 to be punk rock or hardcore related  which would not make you a genre specific festival (after all there are always higher proportion of other genres represented than 10 bands).   At The Drive-In isn't really in this genre to be honest (although they are a great booking). Frank Carter is a great booking as well  but I am every year hoping to see ~10 or so bands that are like:  Strung Out  Dillinger Four  Bad Religion  NOFX  Lagwagon  Alkaline Trio  Rise Against  Thursday  A Wilhelm Scream  New Found Glory  Millencolin  Dropkick Murphys  Against Me! etc. I'm sure you catch my drift. Savages and the rest don't exactly fit into this group... basically the Epitaph / Fat Wreck sound that is very popular but very rarely booked anymore.   Why is there virtually never bands booked in this style  even though we constantly see them fill out bigger venues like Store Vega when they do come around proving their popularity?,0
Nope. All major acts have been announced now,0
We still don't know if there will be special guests...,0
You've got a point  we have discussed that as well. So maybe in the future...,0
We sincerely hope so. Keep your fingers crossed with us  ok?,0
I would attend Tuskegee  Recondite and LCD as well :),0
Roskilde Festival I think that the new school hip hop is a bit OVER reflected though. You could at least have ONE classic hip hop act.,0
It's either Arena or Orange  the schedule will be out later in the month...,0
Having seen about 15 different  album  concerts  I couldn't disagree more with that statement.   You should of course only book bands that have made genuinely great albums. Some examples: Coheed & Cambria playing  In Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth: 3  The Offspring playing  Smash   NOFX playing  Punk In Drublic   Motion City Soundtrack playing  Commit This To Memory   Alkaline Trio playing their entire discography [...] etc :)  They have been some of the most memorable shows for me  having seen almost a thousand concerts at this point.,0
Apollo have been a real stage since 2013  and we do have great night parties for you - just wait untill we release the time schedule.,0
Sure  just a joke  boybands is just typically RF material bur all for variations,0
We think it's time for some other genres to deliver the big parties. But check out Shades  Odesza and Tuskegee.,0
Thanks for the tip :) - sorry I didnt understand the last sentence,0
We fell the same way - thats why  so see you there.,0
He played last year.,0
Alright  bring home some legends next year :) Would have been nice with Public Enemy this year though  I believe I read they were touring.,0
Mark Nope  we'll keep that a secret for now.,0
I know  but he was on this years program earlier  so I still don't understand,0
It won't be touring as much  but it will be out there  yes.,0
Even though they are big enough  I would prefer them in the slightly more intimate Arena scene. :),0
Thanks. And I did get both answers  ),0
We hope so.,0
He played Roskilde Festival 2015,0
We have a lot of Trance  Tekno and House acts  check out Tuskegee  Odesza  DJ Paypal and Recondite among a few.,0
At the end of April,0
Not this year.,0
And do you know what night santigold is playing pleeeeeeaaase!!!,0
Cool. Meaning it will have a more stationary position?,0
Some of them we have had and others we have tried. Others again don't really fit or don't play festivals. We are very proud of this year's line-up including the pop/urban acts but we don't think it's true that it needs to be one headliner that should carry the load for this scene.  Grimes  Wiz Khalifa  Odesza  Anderson .Paak  Elle King  Santigold  M83  James Blake etc. There should be enough even for Simon.,0
Thank you. He wasn't part of our plans this year.,0
Hard to say. Guess time will tell...,0
Check out Anderson .Paak  Tal National  Whitney  Mura Masa  Khun Narin's Electric Phin Band  Birdy Nam Nam for starters. Maybe not exactly the funk you're looking for  but there should be a couple of good one's.,0
Its must be the tendens we see every year with having an artist on one of our smaller stages and then 2 years after they return to play a bigger stage. Recently Disclosure played Orange Stage after they played Apollo a few years before.,0
Check out Tuskegee.,0
Many festivals are more genre-specific than we are  so we may share names with metal festivals  indie festivals  electronic and hip hop festivals etc. It's the mixture and the full festival bill and feeling that should make us stand out. And of course the big focus on world music that is unusual for broader festivals.,0
You have to wait until we release our time schedule in last April.,0
Roskilde Festival Are they clashing? (hope not),0
The very last one was Biffy Clyro - we were waiting for the travel plan to be ok'ed before they could confirm and got it just before our final deadline.,0
We can't tell you before the time schedule is revealed in the end of April.,0
We have a lot of thoughts - but mainly we need to make sure the artist can perform live  will give and get  something  from our audience and they material wise are updated. We also try to make sure our audience and explore new music genres and names.,0
Looking forward to see it then  ),0
Well.... The  moving  apollo pumpkin from 13  didnt really work out as intended...,0
@Laurs  do you even know what music New Order and LCD Soundsystem play..? It's nowhere near similar music... ??,0
The music planner from the festival was on the radio yesterday  and he hinted that LCD Soundsystem will be playing late Saturday night. I'm thinking Arena at maybe 01.00 or 02.00 am...,0
I once read that he won't perform at festivals. Maybe just a myth but still.. :-),0
Haha  good. That's what happens when several people are answering at the same time,0
I do agree.,0
Man I would have loved to see both  especially Thee Oh Sees. I don't care much for Ty's new album... seems like he obsessed too much over his pedals to write any actual songs.,0
Thanks for your time! I hope funk and disco will get a better hold of the world until 2017 - cheers!,0
Saturday - time and stage will be announced when the full schedule is released in the end of April.,0
Try Ho99o9 on for size. They're mighty similar to Death Grips.,0
I'm not even into EDM though. But I'm very happy with your bookings again this year. Cheers.,0
Concerning Ty's new album I kinda agree but i just can't help my self for still loving it. I really dig that whole  i'll just try to act like i should be in a mental hospital  thing. But yeah any festival with Thee Oh Sees on the poster is 20% better than the ones without.,0
Yeah i know  really looking forward to that too,0
Anders. Yup. We well let you know more about this once the final details have been settled.,0
We can't book them all.,0
I second the Ty Segall question. It is beyond me  how he has not played RF at least once  since he is such an obvious pick for a spontaneous and genuine rock-party... Where is he this year? Was he considered?,0
Katherine Yeah  she's playing on Thursday.,0
Suppose it's only fair to share!,0
Thank you so much guys  I'm looking forward to it!,0
It's the best metal line-up in ages if you ask me.,0
 We’ll celebrate this in great manner by putting LCD Soundsystem on our biggest stage for a grand party. ,0
And I doubt that New Order will play an other stage than Orange - so if they clash  it should be possible to see both.,0
Petteri check out Halshug!,0
I know Halshug. Monotone hardcore is not my thing.,0
No. And there wasn't one last year either.,0
Why is that then? Is there any particular reason you have changed the format after so many great Sunday's ?,0
Roskilde Festival I bet the added  guests  implies that there will be either members of Blur or rappers from Gorillaz joining them on stage! I am super excited for this opening! Although I expect it to be the rappers as the Syrian Orchestra most likely will be playing Gorillaz' White Flag  where rappers join in. Anyhow  it will be an amazing show. No matter what he does  Damon always starts a party. Proven at last year's Africa Express concert! :),0
Arthur Kelly The reason for the format change was stated as being partly that the festival now is able to book headlining acts on a Wednesday  which is advantageous since there aren't many other festivals that start mid-week  and that the final day of the festival is now a  full day  instead of the shorter Sunday you were used to.   So it boils down to more music and possibly also bigger names as well as not having to take time off Monday to travel home  -),0
I very much agree with you Petteri Pertola. Unfortunately Danish bookers seems to neglect this genre some  though the venues usually gets sold out when they come. Copenhell has been good to have some of these act the last couple of years. Personally I would hope that we could have a hole festival in this genre  but Denmark is probably too small. Stay punk!,0
Morten Nørgreen Fremming indeed. This is actually why we have been organizing a bus trip every year to go to Groezrock from Denmark... check it out if you haven't heard about it: https://www.facebook.com/events/1722486797972709/,0
That was bad news for me too  I was sure he would be part of the lineup  he beeing in denmark and having a rf16 hole in his schedule. How can we Get this kind of stupid contracts of the marked?,0
Wow  you guys seem like you have a great time booking  and you surely deserve it!,0
Let's hope they pull a Metallica again. But with another band. :P,0
If you like Odesza  you'll most likely also like Hayden James a whole lot!,0
New Order is not EDM but a bit electronic name though.,0
please be Death Grips,0
Dear Roskilde Festival Team   I am writing to enquire who in your team is responsible for the lavatories and sanitary facilities at Roskilde Festival in June and July this year.  My name is Dominic Bryant and I work for EcoToiletten  a German and international social enterprise with the vision of providing mobile lavatories for festivals  construction sites  concerts and private events  which are both environmentally friendly and sustainable.  EcoToiletten’s toilets have proven incredibly popular and successful at festivals throughout Germany since we launched in 2014. Last year the toilets were successfully featured at festivals such as Lollapalooza and Plötzlich am Meer and now we are looking to expand further into Europe.  We attach a high level of importance to provide each festival with an excellent standard of customer support  thus allowing for organisers to focus on the event while we take care of everything regarding sanitation.  Crucially we are no more expensive than the usual chemical toilet and we have the means of supplying and supporting large scale events throughout Europe.  It would be great if you could put me in touch with the person responsible for sanitary supply and lavatories at Roskilde Festival  so we can see whether EcoToiletten can make your event more sustainable. We would relish the chance to demonstrate the success of our toilets at your festival.  You can find further information and pictures on our website www.ecotoiletten.com.  However  if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to email me or we can set up a meeting.  Kind regards  Dominic,0
Hi Dominic  Thank you for your message. Please send it in an e-mail to info@roskilde-festival.dk. That way we can make sure that it reaches the correct people.  Thanks,0
Hi there guys   I did send through an email a few weeks ago but only received an automated response. Is there a best practice you could advise in this instance? Thanks,0

The Black Keys,0
The whole festival site is now open. There was an intense race to be the first one in. Are you ready for four days of amazing music and experiences?,5
Roskilde Festival does the festival site close at night during the music days? would be cool  sleeping one of the days inside the festival area!! haven't tried that yet :D,0
You are not allowed to sleep on the festival site. We need time to clean up and make sure everything is ready for the next day :-),0
Roskilde Festival arh okay no worries  would just have been cool to experience. What time does the music site close and open during the days then?,0
Once we open  we remain open. But still  it's not an area for sleeping,0
Roskilde Festival okay final question. So it is allowed to be on the music site at night  as long as you are not sleeping there?,0
Yup. But after the last concerts you'll probably have more fun exploring all the amazing parties around the camp site.,0
Hey Mette  could you provide us with some specifics on your problem?,0
Thanks for asking.  I Think we Seriously need more toilets ( or make the ones work nicer and quicker). And a place where we can buy some breakfast  a beer or just SOMETHING:) Love to roskilde  still.,0
Thank you for your feedback. You can find alternative toilets in the area nearby - both on the way to the Orange Stage and near the Art Zone. If you have suggestions for improvements for next year's festival please direct them to info@roskilde-festival.dk.,0

And nothing of value was lost.,0
I know you guys at Roskilde probably know more about this than me  but i think that it would be a brilliant idea to swop Drake out with some one in the underground scene. Atmosphere (please make that happen) or Sage Francis would be obvious choiches. Maybe the Roots could take a day of Jimmy Fallon? Or have Outkast play one more time? I know it's a swift in genre but it dosen't seem like Coldplay has any plans for the weekend!,0
As always - Slipknot to the rescue!,0

Heyho dear RF16-Community   is something known about fake rf16-tickets  especially in Germany  Berlin? I've got a really nice-price offer (Hard Tickets from Ticketmaster) from a third-party provider. Now I'm a little sceptical about this. If anyone knows something concrete  please contact me. :)  Greetings and Thanks  see you hopefully on #rf16 ! :),0
Five years ago today this concert was the funeral of LCD Soundsystem. But luckily  they changed their minds. We're completely sure James Murphy still hasn't lost his edge!,8

Dear Kristina og Karl   We understand that this has been a really unpleasant experience for you. Right now there are approx. 70 000 festival guests living at the camping area and with a fully booked festival many of the areas are already filled up  but of course it should be possible for everybody to find a place to camp.  We have replied to you email as well  so hope that it was helpful and that you will be back out here today.,0
I lost my music! It was stolen from our camp this morning around 3 - 3:30. It's kind of huge  and heavy. Any tip that bring back my music box is much appreciated. Please call on +45 2982 2935 Thanx,0

So many good artists/bands this year  and Im not there!! : (,0
Rolling Stones may well be heard from the outside  so Himself on a bicycle with bicycle basket filled with ice-cold drinks in the evening ... Have a good concert to all and see you at the festival Saturday ...,0
Which The Rolling Stones song do you want to hear tonight at #rf14? Enter the vote!,12
Arriving at the festival Thursday? Important information:  Leave early - a lot of people are arriving Thursday … A lot!  Use public transportation to Roskilde Station. From here you can get to the festival area by train or bus.  Arriving by car? Use routes 6 or 14 from the south.  Insist on using the freeway (23)? Fully charge your phone and bring some Rolling Stones albums - you’ll be in a queue for quite some time (but Exile on Main St. is an excellent album).  Even though the festival area won’t be open until 17:00 there’s plenty to do and see in the camping areas. So arrive early to avoid queueing at the entrances.,35
2000  2004  2007  2010  2013 - Do you see the pattern?  #1: Every third year (except the first time) they have played at the festival.  #2: Their newest album was released in November 2012 - that means fresh meat.   #3: A featured artist has already been announced this year. Marie Key features on  Gå Med Dig .   #4: Furthermore  they have been anounced on other Danish festival this summer.  Enough arguments? I really do think so. Please Roskilde. Have you considered NEPHEW for this year's festival? Let's have a blast with these guys on the Orange Stage.,0
Go check out the new album  IN RETROSPECT  by Danish pop-punk/alternative rock band A Road To Damascus - played in its entirety through an enormous stereo at the Rockfreaks.net camp at G68 TODAY at 15:00! The band's vocalist Mikkel Raavig will be there  as will the RF.net guys  so go hang out!,0
Quick correction: Singer Mikkel Raavig is joining us  not the whole band. :),0

Hi Stig  everybody is supposed to get a tent assigned  so there must have been a bit of a mess up in the system last night. We will of course keep this in mind  so Get a Tent will not just be a 'Find a Tent' experience. Hope you will have a great festival.,0
Yesterday you guys proved once again that everything is possible at Roskilde Festival...,4
Hello there! Are you gonna have live stream? Thanks.,0
Not everything. Like getting a new ticket if your own was invalid because somebody had bought it with a stolen credit card and then sold it to me through viagogo. ??,0
I lost my music! It was stolen from our camp this morning around 3 - 3:30. It's kind of huge  and heavy. Any tip that bring back my music box is much appreciated. Please call on +45 2611 3856 Thanx,3
I know Roskilde has a refund system on the plastic beer cups but is there more that could be done to protect the environment? :)  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1004864046268755&id=110874942334341,0

Hi! We have purchased a Caravan Camping ticket and our entrance passes. We have two questions that we couldn't find on your website. 1. Do we have to purchase a parking ticket for our car as well or is parking included in the Caravan Camping ticket? 2. Can our friends who will be camping in East visit us at the Caravan Camping area? See you  soon  :P,0
Hi Kolbjörn. Everything you need to know can be found here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?accommodation=caravan-mc-s-and-sleep-in-buses.   To answer your specific questions:  1. You need to either buy a parking ticket for your car or use the free parking spaces around the festival site.   2. The area is open to everyone at the festival  so feel free to invite all of your friends over.   See you soon  -),0
Will you post the day by day schedule (not the time table)  together with the poster or will it come later?,0
Like this one from last year http://drw5li4pnyc3g.cloudfront.net/2004/roskilde-festival-2015-day-by-day.pdf,0
We will reveal the day-by-day schedule on Wednesday as well :-),0
We will add the 46th poster on 6 April  when the full line-up for Roskilde Festival 2016 is revealed.,57
The Roskilde Festival 2016 poster is almost ready!  We can't wait to share it with you on 6 April. Who are you hoping to see on the poster?,168
Yes  we're aiming at some fresh Scandinavian electronic treats.,0
Does not sound promising. How about some Atoms For Peace and My Bloody Valentine?,0
Jonas Binder Porsborg  that's our focus this time around. Maybe we'll have something for you at some other time.,0
Thats okay  -) I am satisfied with the poster so far! No problems.,0
So  when is it going down today?,0
ROSKILDE WILL NOT BE THE SAME WITHOUT Vicky Lovecat please add them for your Nordic ROOSTER!!! http://youtu.be/VIB7ZXE-QVA,0
Please To meet you. Hope you gets my name!? Sympathy For The Devil!  The Rolling Stones Feeling:),0
Please play Honky Tonk Women for my wife Tina,0
Now its time for voteing on a song for the rolling stones set. Lets go for Street Fighting Man.,0
Help! Would really appreciate if anyone had more information about the Caravan-camping? I have a 7-seat 90's wolkswagen. The only concrete thing the website says is fire extinguishers  which is easily done but what are the actual rules? it's a big bus not made to be slept in obivously but perfectly great to sleep in? would be really sad if we went and wouldn't be let in.,0
This should help you. Don't just through a madras and a fire extinguisher in a van and no more. Your 7-seats is a problem i think  if you can't take some out. Maybe send a email they are very nice people ?? but here are the rules:  arrive in a camper  a caravan  a mobile home or a camping trailer that is registered as such  you are permitted immediate access to the caravan area since your vehicle abides by the laws for official camping vehicles. arrive in a van that has been fitted as a camper and is equipped with permanent fire extinguisher you will gain access to the area. It is important that the vehicle is closed and has fixed walls. arrive in a van in which nothing special has been done to meet the requirements of a camper (e.g. fire extinguishers etc.) you will be denied access to the area.,0
Is Iggy Pop touring this summer?,0
Yes  but he is playing at the Northside Festival  so he isn't coming to Roskilde.,0
The same bastards who stole Suede?,0
No  that was Tinderbox. I don't know if I would categorize it stealing in the case of Suede. More like  relieving us from them...,0
I hoping for Foo fighters in 2017 ,0
Foo Fighters dont need festivals anymore. They fill football stadiums on their own.,0
But they still do festivals also :),0
You just got the year wrong  ),0
They are playing so many festivals this year. Surprised if they don't do it.,0
No they are playing this year :),0
Check the tourdates  almost only festivals shows,0
Yes i know. Im just buying friday ticket this year. Gotta see foo,0
Does anyone have full festival tickets for sale? ,0
Download the sound of Orange Feeling for your phone.   The contest to design the Official Roskilde Festival Ringtone was won by Mexican sound designer Pablo Betancourt who will visit Roskilde Festival for the first time this summer.,12

This year  Roskilde Festival and Stop Wasting Food movement Denmark (Stop Spild Af Mad) join forces to fight food waste!  http://cphpost.dk/news/roskilde-festival-part-of-huge-food-waste-initiative.10057.html  http://www.expatindenmark.com/LunchTalk/Pages/RoskildeFestivalpartofhugefoodwasteinitiative.aspx  http://www.everycrumbcounts.eu/S=0/news/single-news/roskilde-festival-stop-wasting-food-movement-denmark-join-forces-to-fight-f/,1
One-day tickets give access to the festival site as well as the camp site and are valid from 05:00 on the day until 05:00 the next morning. It is not possible to get your wristband in Tivoli. Our crew will do their utmost to ensure as little waiting time as possible  but given that the festival-site opens at 5pm  added waiting time may occur. ,0
Thanks :) But can we have the wristband earlier than 5pm? Can we have it in the morning early?,0
You can exchange your ticket to a wristband once your ticket is valid.,0
OK Cool! From 5am I understand !! Gues it is better than first getting to Roskilde 5pm without,0
All day tickets are valid 5am to 5am the next day.,0
OK Thanks :) But need to know when I can change my ticket to et armbånd :) I guess the will be a lot of waiting time around 5pm,0
The festival site opens tomorrow at 17:00. Accordingly there's going to be a lot of people trying to reach the festival site and dense traffic around Roskilde City is to be expected.,4
Great! But on my ticket it says  acces to festival site from 5am...How does that work if you can't enter until 5pm?,0
There are entrances to the camping site. Its open 24/7. Thats where you exchange your ticket. Then there is another entrance to the main festival grounds. That entrance opens at 17. So you can arrive at 5 in the morning if you like and party on the camping areas/agoras and then at 17 you can enter the festival area.,0
Design this year's audience T-shirt and win tickets.  The contest has started  and we've already received some designs. Send yours to us before 13 March.  For more info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/design-this-years-audience-t-shirt/,5
can you send more than one desing to the contest?,0

Sorry. Only on the day from 5 o'clock in the morning. ,0
Dear Roskilde Festival. We arrive 5 people tonight at about 8 o´clock. We have one large tent for all of us. Where will it be possible to find a place to camp?,0
Campsites N  L and P have yet to be filled @Martijn Johansen,0
The Roskilde Festival lineup is taking shape.   Still about 150 more bands to come before the final poster is revealed on 18 April.,116
Please Roskilde Festival... You have already released a lot of great names for this year's festival... But I would soooooooo much like to dance to this beat this summer....  Please make my dreams come ture...! :-D  http://youtu.be/NSym_3BlE58,0
Uden tvivl warm-up dagenes vildeste show!!!,0
Of Monsters and Men. It doesn't get any more orange than that  Roskilde. This is the best decision you ever made! I can't wait to see them! :D,0
Are the recommendations of two bands for danish or international bands? And are they to play at Pavilion Junior  or during the festival?,0
Any chance of seeing Raury at roskilde this year?,0
Much to look forward to when Cattle Decapitation pops by Roskilde Festival this summer!,0
When will we get more acts :)?,0
Anthrax are playing Norway in july.  Maybe also Roskilde?,0
 Not only did the 41-year-old Bixler-Zavala sound as powerful and emotional as he did two decades ago  but Omar Rodriguez-Lopez remains one of the most audibly recognizable and technically fascinating guitarists in modern music and both Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar carried the band's rhythms as well as ever.   At The Drive In just kicked off their 2016 tour  and it sounds like something awesome is awaiting us at #RF16.,2
I have been waiting for almost 15 years to see At the Drive-in. Your best booking since I first set my foot on Roskilde soil in 2013 =),0
losing it.  so excited about this.,0
Has timetable of festival been published yet? I'm interested in New Order  Tame Impala and RHCP.,0
There won't be a timetable until the end of April-start of May or so.,0
Thank you for information.,0
Earliest. Usually the timetable isnt ready until june.,0
They played in 1984  1993  2002  and this year New Order will be back at Roskilde Festival. Their latest performance at Colbert’s proved that the pioneers of dance rock still are able to throw a party.   Our New Order playlist will take you back in time to their first concert at Roskilde in 1984:  http://roskil.de/neworderplaylist,0
When is the next announcement of new bands gonna be?,0
Soon!   But remember:  patience is the passion of all great hearts  <3,0
This is just genius ! ,0
Now that's definitely value for money!,0
Kan virkelig godt lide jeres Jobsidde  især at  nogle få  stillinger er på Dansk  undtagen rengøring. Rengøring er meget velegnet til udlændinge  ikk'? Flot hensyn til det  internationalt  miljø som er så højt værdsat når der skal sælges billetter.  I really like your Jobs section  especially the bit where  a few  are in Danish  except for the janitorial work. Cleaning up is a suitable task for foreigners  right? A fine show of respect to the  international  environment you guys value so much when tickets need sold.,0
Thank you for getting in touch with us. We are working on translating more volunteer postings that fit international volunteers.  We care a lot about the international environment and want to embrace all volunteers. So if you want to be part of one of our dedicated crews but Danish is not your favorite choice of language then you are more than welcome send an e-mail to volunteer@roskilde-festival.dk.,0

I made this T-shirt design for Roskilde Festival 2013. I hope you guys give me some comment.  The idea of the first design is to say that everyone can express him or her self on there own way with freedom. I used the toilet sign because they are popular and we all know them as they are standing at one spot. I tried to give them some freedom to meet each other and have freedom.  The second design stands for wildness in the free world and the picture represent the wild side of human in a positive way.  comment what do you mean?,0
If I need to book another entrance than I first booked  where do I do this? I've heart I could do it from 1st of March  for around 20DKK? <3,0
Don’t want to struggle with pitching your tent  finding your way to the festival  buying breakfast? Or perhaps you want to sleep in your caravan or bring your motorcycle to the festival? Then now is the time to react.  Hint: We expect the Get A Tent Uptown  Get A Tent Downtown and Get A Camp to sell out pretty fast  so get in on them now if you're into pre-pitched tents and a bit of luxury.,11
Something to pass the time... :),0
Hi Roskilde  you mention on the website that Get-a-tent tickets will be up for sale on March 1st... When do you expect to open this  as it doesn't seem to be an option on billetlugen.dk...? Also  you mentioned that you would have an announcement today (a new version of Reboot camp?)... Waiting impatiently... :-),0
At noon we should be reaDY.,0
Do you see me?,0
Great pic! Awwww... I've wanted to be a volunteer since 2007!!! Jeg savner Danmark!,0

Yay James :D,0
1987. But really... the festival is NOT for the small kids. A british survey described how the one thing children fear the most is drunken adults. Which makes total sense. Why on earth would you bring them to a place dedicated to adult party (and drinks)?,0
1994 and my parents were part of the group starting up the festival in 1973. Wow  thanks a lot mom and dad!,0
My first was in 1978 :) My father got stationed to Germany (American soldier) and my mother is from Roskilde so we spent every summer with my mormor and morfar for 4 years.,0

The APPetizer-app has the proper square numbers on it,0
Unfortunately  we won't be able to get an updated map out in the app. But there's a workaround. If you click the heart in the upper-right corner  and then click  map  in the bottom-right corner (near the Volt logo)  you'll get a map WITH square numbers. You won't be able to see where you are located as you can in the other map  but hopefully you can use it  still. And you can use Mattias' tip.,0
More Pussy Riot at RF14. On Thursday 3 July at 23:30 the award-winning documentary  Pussy Riot - A Punk Prayer  will be shown at our Gloria stage. This might prepare you for when Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina of Pussy Riot speak on Friday at Gloria. ,7
So long that they don't sing...,0
Yeah right. Ill go watch that instead of the greatest rock n roll band of all time  ),0
This year we have prioritised not to show any matches from the Worldcup in Brazil. The reason behind is a combination of things: price for getting permission (which would make our budget smaller for our other activities)  the quality of the screening-solution  the time when the matches are shown  license to show the matches etc. Roskilde Festival offers a huge variety of possibilities for our festival participants - ranging from concerts to other engaging events.Our volunteers have been planning for months and we have chosen to focus on these events. But overall it’s a complex situation and a difficult decision with pros and cons  which we have carefully thought about. We hope that all football fans will have a great festival although we do not show the matches from Brazil. ,0
Do not Support that DEVIL  pusst riots  do not regret GOD!!!,0
I'm sitting here in my camp and respect the decision actually. Love football  but I get your points. ,0
You are not missing much. The games today has been a total snoozefest.,0
Skip some of all that leftwing feelgood crap  and show us football.,0
it HAS to be better next year !!!,0
How about you show up a few hours later if its too much to handle. Nobody is forcing you to be there exactly when they open. I dont get why people have to get in first. No other festival in the world has these problems with their camping areas. There is space for everyone. I dont get it.,0
I dont get it either and its not about me - in general - I think its dangerous :-(,0
Im not beeing there at all - it would be too hard to handle for me for sure,0

This just hit the festival mailbox: First tattoo of the new logo! Hairy leg supplied by festivalgoer Mads Bøge Højberg. That was quick.,8
Sorry for spamming by the way  but simply had to share it :-),0
the old logo was nice  but 10 years is a long time. The world changes and the new logo is a powerful reminder that Roskilde changes with it!  I'm sure we'll all grow to be as fond of it as the old one :),0
I would love it if you said to the owner of this tattoo 'haha  only joking about the new logo',0
Mads! :D,0
If I´ll post a NEW tattoo with the old logo- would you tell Rhianna that she lost the fight against REAL music and its lovers???? :D,0

There is still free camping-spaces on E  B and P. ,0
Is it possible that there will not be space left on Thursday before noon? Where should we head first? Just got one tent. ,0

Hey guys   I've sent 3 e-mails to handicapservice with questions about how to apply for a companion to the festival but received no answer. Is the link with the application already available? and do I need to have a ticket already to apply? thanks.,0
When are you expecting to release the full line up?,0
Jean Michel Jarre just announced a large Europen tour based on his new Electronica project. He´s playing some festivals and have a suitable opening at the time for RF. That would be a great booking i my book. A true legend in the field of electronic music to top the electronic side of the lineup.,0
Thats why I stick with beer on festivals  ). Seriously that sounds extremly bad and needs to be reported.,0
Dear Camilla  we have contacted RTR Kloakservice A/S and they're looking into it. Once we have more information we will let you know. ,0
Thank you.,0
Dear Camilla As promised here’s a follow-up on your observation. First of all  it is important to stress that the situation you describe is not under any circumstances acceptable and deviates from the very clear standard procedures. We have been in close dialogue both with the providers and our internal teams and emphasised the need for carefully following these procedures and to focus even more on optimising hygiene. Roskilde Festival does everything to ensure a clean and healthy environment  which is why we also have daily health inspections. Furthermore  the area will be checked thoroughly for bacterias by a medical officer  who will review if we need to be extra cautious or undertake further measures to optimise the hygiene.  We hope that you will enjoy the rest of Roskilde Festival.  ,0
When will we be able to see the concerts live through streaming? and do you have a link already? :D,0
Hej Marie! We don't have a set schedule yet  but will definitely let you know once we do!,0
Remember yesterday?  Get a recap of the first full day of #RF14 here:,23
What reassuring optimism: 'We had a little rain  but it brought out a beautiful rainbow' Ben  Henry,0
That's my picture! ????,0
I can't wait to tell everyone I come across how beautiful it is to meet them,0
How are you? I'm lovely,0
It's a great pic. Saw it on Instagram yesterday and loved it. Are you one of the official photographers then  or was it pinched?,0
We love all our canopies - as do a lot of you. So we decided to met up with a couple of festivalgoers who loved the canopy so much that they got it tattooed onto their body - and got their reaction on the new logo.,2
While you're at it  how's about renaming the Arena stage to the Valhalla?  That's the actual name of the tent that's used  and it's much more fitting. :D,0
Don't play with your logo! ,0
The logo has changed — the feeling is permanent.  For hi-res version: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3148995/logo-timeline.pdf,28
Who are the designers?!,0
Hans Christian Skaarup  nothing is timeless - that's one of the points of this photo. Feel free to dislike the new logo  though - it does take some getting used to when a new visual identity is introduced.,0
Why?,0
Isabel  the logi is designed by e-Types,0
YESSS LET'S ALL HATE A LOGO,0
'Nothing is timeless' is a rather extreme statement!,0
I thought e-types were good at this!,0
Better than the 1994 logo... eugh..,0
Jens Hartmann Schmidt  this is linked to a change in our visual identity - where we're changing the names of some of the other parts of our organisation. The old logo is 10 years old and was designed at a time when we didn't use it as much digitally as we do today. So  we also needed a logo with a stronger digital presence. After 10 years it makes sense to alter the canopy a bit (the canopy's still there  though). It's the same thing with Roskilde Festival - the festival also develops.,0
As a  e-designer and current living design student on my bachelor years  i know many things is not timeless   and i know a new logo takes time and is a big leap and  risk  for your current identity  but i hope you did not pay for that change. as a roskilde festival participant since 08 that logo has been a big part of it  i have seen the  galleri  with former posters you had last year for the celebration of how the festival has evolved. everything has a start  and  everything has a end and that gallery was a positive sight so see how the festival evolved bigger  better and safer.  i am no big logo designer  but know what it is about  but your now former logo was good  sleek  and stylish  had more Rock and roll and even a very modern touch to it even with the black font the center of the logo was the tent  the soul of roskilde  the stage where the music is born and where focus is aimed at. the center of attraction     your new logo is in a way    out of sync   and  not modern at all. it looks like it is a special concept for a specific area or theme for the festival.. ( this is in my opinion )  i do like the festival and you are improving year after year.  and as said.. its just a logo. but in my opinion the new logo is a big leap away from what you could have done with a new logo.   i hope you will have succes with it because you deserve it with no matter what you do  but i doubt it will be accepted as much as your former.  your  brand  is even so big you could cut out the   roskilde festival   part and just have the tent.   that is strong. and people know what it is.  that would be my guess for a better logo  and to say nothing is timeless is really quite a statement to make  should be reconsidered ,0
Less is more,0
Must say I don't really care for the new logo and colour scheme. An update to the typography of the old logo would be welcome  however changing the symbol altogether was not really necessary. Most brands modernise their logos from time to time  but changing the geometrical shape of the tent is a re-branding that makes little sense  when one has such a well known symbol. The Apple-symbol for example  has been modernised many many times  but it's shape (outline) has been identical since 1976. I was hoping Roskilde would keep that same design principle in mind  as their iconography the last 9 years has been brilliant.,0
It's too square! We don't want to permanently feel square!,0
out with the new in with the old =),0
 nothing is timeless .. is that a joke?,0
I know it is something we can all get used to  but I don't like it!!!!  It looks like a kids toy festival or pop festival for toddlers.  I would say  Shame on you Roskilde  but you do so much good and so much right  if it is only the logo that sucks well then I will just deal with it.  You will still see Camp Wolfpack in June!,0
So Batman did the 1978-80 logo?,0
David Botofte Henriksen and Teis Zacho  ok  that WAS a rather extreme statement but wasn't meant as such. We love that people feel so connected to the canopy  which is why we couldn't dream of getting rid of it. But we definitely don't think the old logo could be considered timeless.,0
I belive that people are very nostaglic about the last (2003-2012) design because it has been around for so long. I had almost forgotten the 1998-2002 one  ),0
95-96 looks awesome I think. Last years logo was the best. The new  All orange is kinda kindergarten look-a-like.,0
Must say that I prefer the 03-12 one for it´s batman-like logo and the smaller black font. But i like the color better on the new one and maybe the rest will grow on me during the festives,0
Good on you  Roskilde Festival. The old logo had a nice feel to it  because it's been like that for nine freaking years. Yes  people  that's life.  I like the new logo as much as the old one  and I don't care if you've spiced up the orange a little. To be honest  I've always felt that the canopy needed a facelift.  Approved!,0
My 1st time Roskilde was 1995 or 96  I think...,0
Roskilde Festival the only thing about the old logo that was not timeless was the type.. you have fixed that now  but destroyed the logo in the process.. you have made a mistake and now you are desperate holding onto it  because you spend too much on it to throw it in the trash,0
The font is much better  the logo is a little bit uglier. Thats my first-view opinion. But i think it will grow on me after i have looked on it a few hundred times. People will always have strong expressions for new things and will try to hold on to the old. But you know what people - youre opinions are just opinions. Not the truth. And some people really need to learn how to express critisism.   Give it a few month and i dont think you will feel so strongly about the old one anymore.,0
Your logo is bad  and you should feel bad,0
Signe Manat Hansen  why should we feel bad? We develop many things all the time  and as you can see  the logo has been altered quite a few times over the years. That being said  we definitely understand the connection to the logo - and this wasn't an easy decision for us. But it was needed.,0
not really,0
David Botofte Henriksen  changing the logo doesn't mean that there was something wrong with the old one. But it didn't work as well digitally as the new one. And it wasn't just the old typography. It had to do with the shape as well. The old logo has served us all well for10 years - longer than some of the other versions of the canopy logo. But we wouldn't dream of throwing out the canopy symbol.,0
I love the timeline on instagram http://imgur.com/ynrxGRF,0
the old logo is way to powerfull to just throw away like that.. then one you have now will be old in 1 year,0
you should have just changed the font.. like this http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/3812/roskilde.jpg,0
Andreas Reinholdt Poulsen: Consider making a T-shirt (you seem to have the skills) -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/design-this-years-audience-t-shirt/,0
While the new type is much better  the new tent shape completely lacks the dynamic feeling of the previous version. The new version of the tent feels much more stiff and boring.,0
Same font as Absolut Vodka o____O,0
Niels Koch: You got 6 tattooes with the canopy logo? (wow!) Just the 2003-2012 version or also some of the older versions? That is pretty epic and dedicated. Share if you can. Would love to see.,0
New logo is fine. But I would be confused if I saw it without the text. So im glad you included that.,0
Don't judge by the appearance. Roskilde is an amazing festival even for those that don't like the logo! <3,0
The old may not be timeless  but the new one seems dated already now. I see that this logo will work more for more digital and printing purposes  yet this doesn't make it a pretty logo. I understand people may have a hard time succumbing to changes  but consider that not all changes are for the best  and I'm certainly not against changing it  it's just this version I personally find unfit for the festival.  As for the font I liked the old one because it was simplistic and clean  the new one not so much  and that may be because of it's just too bold.,0
@Jacob Korsgaard Christiansen:  Roskilde Festival's name or logo may not be part of the design (however  it might be added to the final product)  - quote from here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/design-this-years-audience-t-shirt/,0
fuck the logo...!! just keep the feelings Orange....   o)=,0
You should have kept the old font :-),0
It's not the Impact font (easiest to tell by the R  which has a curved tail in Impact) - other than that 'R'  the rest looks closer to Helvetica but somehow manages to be even more anonymous than Helvetica is. Judging from the description in the logo history  it's a custom typeface ( custom typography ). For now  I'll dub it Rarial. Like Arial  it copies all the bad stuff from Helvetica  replacing the few good features with something worse. Doesn't look *quite* as bad as Arial  though. But quite a lot more boring. :-) ETA: Apparently  it's actually called  4000 . I'll keep calling it Rarial.,0
It's neither Impact  Helvetica or Futura. It's a custom font called '4000' (guess why? :-))  designed by e-Types.,0
Hope e-Types wasn't paid extra for that half-assed left-skewed font (in  THE EVOLUTION... )  which was clearly done by simply distorting the letterforms paying absolutely no attention to all the problems it introduces. Might as well do that manually in Illustrator or whatever you're using. That said  who cares about a logo? :-P As long as the typeface's (and canopy's) corporate lines don't send the management into too much of a corporate mindset.  -),0
Go through the steps and in the end you can choose this option.,0
hey all you Roskilde veterans....do they allow re-entry?,0
Re-entry? Can you expand on that?,0
can you go back and forth between the festival site and the camping area through out the day,0
Yes you can. As long as you have a valid wristband,0
Ah  of course! As much as you like.,0
good! Thank you!,0
I say this with love. And I have a few tips:  The Killers (In Ukraine 2nd of July) Iggy Pop and the Stooges (In Europe at the end of June) The Gaslight Anthem (In Europe in the middle of June) Clutch (Plays at Metaltown same weekend as Roskilde) Graveyard (Plays both Metaltown and Rock Werchter) The Hives (In Europe during June and July)  EDIT: The Who (In Europe during June and July) Vintage Trouble (On tour with The Who)  If you can make some of this happen  I would be very happy man.,0

The Killers and rock'n'roll in the same sentence? I've seen it all now :-),0
Swap The Killers with Rival Sons and I can follow your request,0
Rival sons  Witchcraft  free Fall  bullet  airbourne  orchid - now are talking!,0
what are they talking about?,0
At least some of the old Killers could be considered rock.   I would be pleased to see Rival Sons on the bill  but they are not touring this summer. So I'll have to settle with seeing them in Malmö.  An additional note to my post: The Black Crowes is available in the summer and have just said that they will be announcing European dates soon.,0
Please book The Who again to Roskilde. They are going to play at festival in Spain in june. Hoping for Roskilde Festival also :),0
The link (Buy your parking voucher here) on your web  to buy parking voucher does not direct to parking voucher... :),0
Hej Mads! Yes  you can get your ticket at the train station west. Have a good one!,0
Dear Roskilde! Last night I lost a very good friend  while partying at the east campsite. He is white and fluffy  loves to kiss and party hard and its hard not to fall in love with him. I want him back! Please! He means a lot to me. Its also his first festival! Its the unicorn called Kissi  im sure he is still here somewhere. Help me find him  my camp and I are willing to do a lot of weird things to get him back again!,0
We have not seen the unicorn  but we have dispached a search and rescue team to look for it! If anyone sees or hears anything about the unicorn  we will be very happy to hear from you. ,0
You make me so happy Roskilde!!! I will follow up if i get him back! Og så noget mere rødvin,0
The Usual Suspects,0
What kind of weird stuff are u gettin' me into this time Line ?!!?,0
OMG BOOK NIN!!:   Looks like NIN will appear at the Fuji Rocks Festival  which takes place from July 26 to 28 in Niigata  Japan  as well as at the Rock 'n' Heim Festival  which takes place July 16 to 18 in Hockenheim  Germany.  ,0
Will instantly buy ticket this very instant.,0
The Rock'n'Heim festival isn't until mid August. Someone got the dates wrong.,0
And he is going to play with Queens of the stone age. He is one of the new member for the next album.,0
Oh god no =/,0
Eller omvendt: FIND ME! (I'm drunk and in some lame camp),0
Find me and the route to my tent gps style,0
I see no reason why not,0
The festival has ruled them out  stating that Radiohead won't be available to them in 2016.,0
Anders Cold  ok - and where do you have this info from,0
What if its still possible to join Roskilde Festival? Call 91 25 07 50 or 60 77 46 76 and MGO Paraguay will help you get a volunteer position for the festival!,0

Crystal Castles will play Roskilde Festival 2013.  They inject a punk energy into their trance-inspired electronica – painting beautiful images of a cold world.  Earlier we also announced The Lumineers  Of Monsters and Men and Marie Key.  See the band list (we're building up to a total of 200 acts): http://roskilde-festival.dk/music,103

That's... Actually... Pretty solid.,0
I am searching and searching  but I cannot find the punk in it. Punk is dead. Nice trippy stuff  though.,0
Oliver Kissling  it's not punk per se. But the energy's there. Check out their early stuff  especially.,0
lol what happened to u roskilde,0
Not realistic at all  why bother?  p,0
The Lumineers will also play Roskilde Festival 2013.  Their stomp-and-clap folk rock is conquering the world at the moment.  Earlier we also announced Of Monsters and Men and Marie Key.  We'll be back at 12:00 with our final announcement.,50
Very nice!,0
Gotta check that out then!,0
Ah  this was the teaser bit about teeth. Well played  Roskilde! http://www.lumineers.com/,0

Hey everyone. Please take five minutes to look at this: We have created a questionnaire regarding music festivals  more specifically Roskilde Festival  and the participants’ trash habits during the festival. We need your input to make an awesome and relevant project  that we later will implement at Roskilde festival this year! The questionnaire does not take more than five minutes to participate  but your time is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance and we hope to see you at Roskilde Festival. QUESTIONNAIRE: http://goo.gl/forms/a4ixI8fByC  **Danish** Hej alle sammen. Brug lige fem minutter på at kigge på dette opslag: Vi har skabt et spørgeskema omhandlende musikfestivaler  mere specifikt Roskilde Festival  og deltagernes vaner hvad skrald angår. Vi har meget brug for jeres input til at lave et lækkert og relevant project  som senere vil blive implementeret på Roskilde Festivalen i år! Det tager ikke længere tid end fem minutter at udfylde spørgeskemaet  men det betyder vitterlig alverden for os. Tak for forhånd og vi håber at ses på Roskilde Festival.  SPØRGESKEMA: http://goo.gl/forms/a4ixI8fByC,0
You've got a cinema-tent dont you?,0
Not anymore!,0
The crowd at the Macklemore & Ryan Lewis concert in 2012 were some of the first to hear about popping tags and 99 cents coats. It was one of the first times Thrift Shop was played live. This time it'll definitely trigger some serious sing-along.,11
I remember it like yesterday.  Epic live performance  ?????,0
It was one of my favorite concert experiences and by far the most energetic and fun concert I have been to :) good memories,0
Didn't even realize they played then! ?? #embarrased #willmakeamends,0
Was awesome. Macklemore stood up in the crowd on my hands :D,0
Michelle Villanueva Siversen :D,0
Being on a macklemore concert is like hearing 2 songs  then go to another band.,0
Didnt see him?/them? in 2012 and will definatly not see him/them this year.,0
Because they pay a lot of money to book great artists. Its a music festival not a sport event. They didnt show the world cup last time either,0
Are you a fan of foam?  The incredible foam fanatics of Camp Crazy Legs will kick off Dream City 2016 tomorrow alongside a whole bunch of other amazing camps. We can't wait to see what they'll come up with in Dream City - Roskilde Festival this summer.,5

Hello Roskilde. I'm putting together a festival preview for a London-based website. Does somebody who attended Roskilde last year (2015) want to answer two questions about the experience for me? Super quick. And you'll be credited in the piece.,0

Hello! Are the camping van places all sold out?? We have a trailer combi camper and can't work out if there's still place or not ??,0
Hi Dawn We haven't put them up for sale yet. Sign up for our newsletter here to get a notice http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2016,0
MØ did it in 2013  The Minds of 99  S!vas and Blaue Blume did it in 2014  Choir of Young Believers did it in 2007 - played their first Roskilde show on one of our stages for upcoming music.  In 2016 we'll once again present a line-up of exciting new talent that will play during the first days of the festival. Check out the rising stars: roskil.de/RisingPlaylist  Many more will be added when we release the full line-up.,7
Why does Wi fi not work at camping area ?,0
You know how they say that the journey is its own reward? Our festival visitors most certainly agree that public transport is the way to go when coming to Roskilde.   PS: If you find your way here on Friday  Saturday or Sunday - we still have One-Day Tickets available: http://bit.ly/1pETLRM,8
I have two available spots in a bar in the music days. Write me if you want a job at this years festival,0
Of Monsters and Men will also play Roskilde Festival 2013.  The Icelandic band's grandly orchestrated folk pop is loaded with hands-in-the-air joy of life.  Earlier we also announced Marie Key.  We'll be back at 11:00 with our third announcement (out of 4).,74
Hurra!!! :D,0
Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros much? Except for the vocals of course :),0
:'D,0
That's certainly one good reason to buy a ticket. Unfortunately attendance won't be possible.,0
Now THAT is an excellent booking! Thank you Roskilde :-),0
Hurra :D :D :D,0
Is ithe band from Iceland? They re soooo good,0
FOR SATAN JAAAAA !! :D,0
Can't wait!,0
Awesomeness! :D,0
what is the name of this song? :),0
Marie Key will play Roskilde Festival 2013.  This is airy  Danish-language pop from a sharp pen.  We'll be back at 10:00 with our second announcement (out of 4).,63
couldn't find anyone better huh?,0
'Natholdet' told us that last week. :-),0
When will you release the other bookings?,0
Halfdan: most likely at 10  11  12 @ 13 If three are five :),0
Actually it says so in the post: next at 10 (Four in total),0
Come on Crystal Castles!,0
Helt sikkert! :D,0
This week we've added 20 new acts to the line-up. Check out our playlist and explore the #RF16 line-up.  So far we've announced 74 of 175 acts. The line-up already include: LCD Soundsystem ? Macklemore & Ryan Lewis ? Mø ? New Order ? PJ Harvey ? Red Hot Chili Peppers ? Tame Impala ? Tenacious D ? Wiz Khalifa and many more.,19
I feel like Tenacious D should get top billing.,0
I think Tame Impala or LCD Soundsystem are the top name,0
When's the next drop and when's the last?,0
Please book Deadmau5  he's touring Europe this summer. (I'm in Australia  and very tempted to fly over to Roskilde  please give me loads of great reasons to do so <3),0
So it s either a full ticket of 1995 or only 1 day of 995dkk?? Can somebody explain me what about that 40 dkk entrance? What is it actually for?,0
Lucia Müther . Tenacious D . Just sayin,0
Well  they ARE a headliner  but all headliners are sorted alphabetically.,0
Quality stuff  that's for sure!,0
Smart! But I still feel like Tenacious D should break the alphabet and lead the show. You can't explain feelings Roskilde  those two fat old men have simply stolen my heart with their rock.,0
We can't say yet. But don't worry - we'll let you know.,0
In the previous years  the last acts have been announced in April/May,0
omg  das Line-up ist ja geil... I need money,0
We plan to give you loads of reasons. We still have 101 acts to announce. It will be great!,0
Look here: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/guide?tickets-access=entrance-booking  Entrance booking is ONLY for those who want in as soon as we open. If you can wait a couple of hours or more  you don't need it.,0
I'm shaking with excitement! :),0
The best way to shake!,0
Sorry. No  that's only for guests with tickets for Get A Tent Central. ,0
Ok no prob  have to go to East/West then. Is there a possibility to park a car somewehere near these gates for a moment during the pickup or should I come by foot?,0
We recommend coming by foot,0
You are welcome,0
Am i the only one in the world who is having this problem when i'm trying to buy tickets (one-day-ticket) on the roskilde-festival.dk .. i have tried everything  used different emails and password and so on.   pls help,0

Try another web browser. Sure you dont already have an account?,0
If you have problemes buying tickets you will have to contact www.billetnet.dk,0
another browser didn't work thanks anyway ...... Roskilde Festival is there a e-mail or something that i can contact about this problem ?,0
yes .. i am sure about that,0
Hey! We tried to check with the vendors  but so far it doesn't look like it. Better come prepared!,0
Hey Festival go'ers ! Im Harriet from new zealnd now living in australia travelling over the other side of the world to go to the festival by my self  Wondering if there is any others from aus or nz or any other buddys that would like to buddy up with me !!! i LOVE music and alcohol :-) get in touch,0
I am from the states and been thinking of flying out for this. Is it possible to go and not camp?,0
Sure it is. Roskilde is located just 30 minutes away from Copenhagen  and we have trains and buses operating around the clock between Roskilde Festival and the capital city. So you just need to find a room/bed somewhere.,0
Anywhere I can get more info on the buses/trains?,0
Do the camp. You can buy a tent at the site.,0
Worth it to camp alone? Just nervous because I might be traveling alone.,0
It wont be a problem! Just befriend the neighbours. The camping part is better than the music!,0
Schedules for buses and trains will be up later in the spring. But they operate more or less around the clock.,0
Foo Fighters er pt.  on a hiatus .,0

I dag er det 14 år siden  at 9 mennesker mistede livet på Roskilde Festival. Hvad med at holde 2 min. stilhed kl. 23.45  som er nogenlunde det tidspunkt ulykken skete  for at ære de familier  der mistede medlemmer den aften?  Today it's been 14 years since 9 people lost their lives at Roskilde Festival. How about having 2 min. of silence at 11.45 pm. - which is approximately the time at which the accident occurred - to honor the families that lost members that night?  #RF14,0
any teaser today? :),0
How are you all doing?  #RF14 started 24 hours ago. We have captured some of the best moments from yesterday's grand opening. Maybe you're part of our story...,9

You can bring your tent but will not have access to the camping- and festival area before 5 o'clock in the morning - and have to leave 5 o'clock the following morning.,0
If you have two one-day-tickets you have to go to the entrance and get a new wristband on day two. BUT when you arrive (on day friday) you can ask for getting the wristbands for both days. ,0
It's not a guarantee  sorry. It depends on if entrance will have the wristband for both days.  ,0
It's allowed to ride a bike around the camping area  but is it allowed to bring your bike to Get a Tent - Central?,0
Hello Jonas. No  that is not allowed because the Get a Tent Central is connected to the festival site. Sorry. ,0
Nine Inch Nails will come together again this summer! Please invite them to Roskilde.,0
foals and mumford & sons!! ,0
Dengue Fever will be touring in Europe in early July!!!,0
Can whe watching football on the festival site belgium fan,0
No  sorry. This year we have prioritised not to show any matches from the Worldcup in Brazil. The reason behind is a combination of things: price for getting permission (which would make our budget smaller for our other activities)  the quality of the screening-solution  the time when the matches are shown  license to show the matches etc. Roskilde Festival offers a huge variety of possibilities for our festival participants - ranging from concerts to other engaging events. We hope that all football fans will have a great festival although we do not show the matches from Brazil. ,0
oke thanks for the info,0
Can you use maestro at Roskilde Festival?,0

No nukes,0
The only way Kraftwerk could evolve is to go back to their roots  ie start to play a more  dirty  organic freeform music. This robotic anti-romantic style was new in the 70ies  but now tiring. Imagine the ruckzuck  ananas symponie  stratovarious era in a new style. As being a Kraftwerk fan  still I could say they are now a very predictable band  like Rolling Stones. Best in their genre  but very predictable.,0
Great tribute to the people at Fukashima.,0
It's a DREAM to see a Kraftwerk Live show someday!,0
Brilliant been a fan since Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der autobahn.....seriously considering going  anyone else (I know thinking about it  Jason Lee Ritchie? :-),0
Love Kraftwerk and LOVE this. I am fluent in Japanese and lived in Nihon many years. Was back last summer for a month. People in Japan are worried  very worried. Just like Krafwerk says re the radiation   YAMERO!  (STOP IT!),0
 Fukushima  Oh my gosh  they finally did it.,0

Flying from London today! Wish me luck.... 9 weeks to go until I'm due to give birth to my baby.... Only festival in the world that I feel is safe and friendly enough to go to in my state!  Any advice to a 31 weeks pregnant me????,0
Congratulations on your baby and have a great safe festival!,0

Yup. That was the second thing on my list  first was find a man to carry it around all festival!,0
here is one: http://bit.ly/1ohrIEn,0
no. we did not do that this year. You'll get your wristband at the entrances  but that is easy too. Have a great Festival.,0
Bring all the tickets and you can claim all tents at the same time,0
Saturday's a very popular day. In fact  we have VERY few one-day tickets for Saturday left. If you fancy going  you have to act now - soon it's sold out.  Tickets: http://po.st/RF14ticket,34
Sidste chance Claus Bruun Kim RanfeltMichelle Bjørn Olsen Tommy Flood :-D,0
(y),0
Glad me and my parents already got our tickets! So psyched to see Arctic Monkeys and Interpol especially.,0
Hi. I've bought one-day tickets for both friday and saturday  knowing that there were not many tickets left for those days. However  last update you made  there were still tickets left for sunday (plenty in fact!)  and I'm just wondering that if I decide on saturday that I would like to stay for sunday  is there a chance that there will still be tickets for sunday? Also  can I pick up both wristbands for friday and saturday when I arrive friday  or what's the best way to do that? Kind regards! :-),0
Hello again Seyfat. Sorry  just found out that you will have to go to the entrance and get a new wristband for the specific day (in the morning). Unfortunately  you cant get both on the fist day. It's impossible to predict if and when the tickets for sunday will be sold out. Sorry. ,0
Mattias is right. Busses run around the clock. You can find more information about transportation here http://roskilde-festival.dk/dk/praktisk/#c17825,0
From five in the morning and then 24 hours ahead. You will have to leave the festival again at five in the morning the following day.,0
Thank You!,0
Sorry about the late reply - at this moment you will probably only have to wait ten minutes.,0

That is correct. No football this year,0
Those rumours are true. We will not show world cup games on a big screen  but we  are sure that you will either find something else to do out here or maybe you could go to the wifi areas and stream it via your smartphone.  ,0
Forgotten who's playing at Roskilde Festival 2013?   Don’t panic.   Check out our new playlist on Soundcloud  more than 5 hours of music!,20
Please cancel this,0

Dear friends!  Remember to send an application for Clean Out Loud if you would like camp in one of our clean and environmental areas.   The spots are very popular and the deadline is 1 March  2016  only two days from now  so hurry up before it is too late.   Read all about right here:    http://roskil.de/reserve-a-central-clean-camping-spot  Have a great Sunday and treat your hangovers nice!,0
Clean out loud = shit,0
Trying to make some bad news good… Twitching Tongues have had to cancel their EU tour this summer  including Roskilde Festival. Instead  we’ll be RUN OVER by hard-hitting letlive.  On Tuesday we’ll add further 20 new acts to the line-up  many of which will define the sound of tomorrow.,5
Again: RADIOHEAD!,0
- Epicness...! \m/o_O\m/,0
Helena From T Christina From Tomczyk Kitwa Norreen nye navne snart! ????,0
Not gonna take COMPLETE credit for letlive. but I DID have them on my top 5  ),0
the sound of tomorrow on tuesday  means the sound of wednesday then.. Looking forward to it :),0
When do you release the final program ??,0
From what date will  Special camping  (for caravans  etc.) be available?,0
When is the release?,0
Finnish avant-garde metallers Oranssi pazuzu would be a perfect fit for Roskilde Festival's forward-thinking line-up  we think. Read our review of their new album  #Värähtelijä  here:,0
Is your camp up all night and do you clean up after every festivity? Now you can reserve a central clean camping spot in area E!        For more details: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/news/2016/reserve-a-central-clean-camping-spot  Deadline: 1 March,8
Sounds brilliant...instead of this shit....!!!,0
Are you supposed to receive an email confirmation after you have applied?,0
From what date will  Special camping  (for caravans etc.) be available?,0
Could you explain why this link is not longer available?  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152053225216706&set=a.99196301705.99302.10248811705&type=1&fref=nf,0
Where does that link leed to? Since it is no longer available we can't really see where it should have led to?,0
Here's the original.  I'm curious why you walked back both the photo and your defense of it without explanation.  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=722038521189371&set=a.699580733435150.1073741830.671456386247585&type=1,0
Daen de Leon  we wrote a comment explaining that this picture wasn't intended to offend anyone - not by us and not by the camp behind it. We saw it as a satirical comment on 19th century European colonists. But we quickly learned that some people saw it as something much more direct. And seeing that some people accused the camp behind the picture of having a worldview which they clearly didn't have on top of it all  we wrote in the comment that we would delete the picture a couple of hours later - hoping that most of you who had commented on the post would see the explananation before the deletion. Unfortunately it wasn't the case for you. So here you have it.,0
We are sorry  but we don't have that arrangement with Tivoli anymore. So I am afraid you will have to pay an entrance fee to go to Tivoli this year. You will get your wristbands when you arrive out here. See you soon. ,0
Design the coolest T-shirt and win tickets and glory.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/design-this-years-audience-t-shirt/,21
Now :D Are you going to book us some Iceage??,0
Please bring us back The Who to Roskilde :),0
When will your come up with some new names? So long ago you did last and Im so exited :),0
It won't be long!,0
Is it possible to watch the world cup football somewhere at the festival?,0
Sorry  but we don't show world cup football this year.,0
Earplugs is a great invention :),0
Well i'm using those when sleeping on the ordinary camping  but when the rules a this campsite says it has to be quiet at ten so that people can sleep it makes no sense when the bass of one stage makes about as much noise as if I were sleeping in the ordinary campsite  ),0
Plus I've paid extra to sleep here because it was proclaimed to be a calm area for those who work here :p,0
We are sorry that you are bothered by the noise from Camping West  but earplugs may be your best solution. The restricted camping site for volunteers is siutated quite central  so you don't have to walk for several hours to get to work. However that means there will also be some noise from the nearby Camping West.  You are however guaranteed that your neighbour will not play loud music all night. Where do you live at the restricted campsite? The area is quite large and maybe you can actually move further away from Camping West and be less bothered by noise?,0
This is my first time at Roskilde and I have a question. I'll arrive just on Thursday (unfortunately). I bought only the full festival ticket. Can I find a place to put my tent  even arriving so late? Or should I buy some extra like ''Get a tent'' or ''Entrance booking''. Looking foward to Roskilde Festival!!,0
Thats more than enough. The 3m are in regard to the  streets  between the tent sections. Of course its not possible to have 3m between every tent. The campin area would be half of Själland in that case  ),0
Frederik Scharling  it should be  but we can't give you a 100% guarantee,0
What are the opening hours for the Festival Gear stall at City Centre East? I'm interested mainly in late Tuesday evening. Would also like to know if there is a price list for the gear available online?,0
Are you having a good time at Roskilde Festival? Use our official hashtag #RF14 on Facebook  Twitter and Instagram so we can see how you're doing.,11
Unfortunately parking East is sold out but there are still places at parking South and parking  West.,0
Yes  off course  you can come down tomorrow and get your wristband. We look forward to see you.,0
3 straight year! See you guys tomorrow! And thanks for the quick respond!,0
It is open now and will stay open twentyfourseven.  It's placed east of gate 10,0
Ok. Is it possible to do an inquiry online? Am trying at a distance to help my daughter who is a newbie at RF and lost most of her luggage last night at the race :-(,0
No you can only get the bracelet on the day its for. If you have a thursday ticket then you can exchange it on thursday 5am earliest.,0
Rasmus presale of parking tickets stopped friday  - as long as they're available we're selling them on site.,0
what Mattias said...,0
Do you streaming concerts like last year?,0
Roskilde Festival 2014 is now open.   50 000 people are on their way in - on time. Thanks for your patience and please take care of each other. Have a great #RF14 .,85
Kappes Gabs Hansen  you've got a point. We should probably do something about that.,0
Is that a hint? :),0
Thank You Roskilde My Old Friend!!,0
It seems obvious to me that you have to constrain every single audience menber but one from dancing when Baauer plays the intro to Harlem Shake this summer.. Any plans on how to make that happen?,0
We'll leave that ALL up to you  the audience :-),0
Does  Numbers  count as one act or seven?  Will they be doing one show or several? ,0
It's one show with seven acts - if that answers your question.,0
I think it does :),0
In the garden...,0
This is Lars-Uno and Hussam. They’re good friends  but until recently they had no clue that the other person existed. One of them is from Sweden  the other is from Syria. Hussam came to Sweden as a refugee. This was to be his new home  and with his arrival – and the arrival of many others – Lars-Uno’s home also changed.   Every year at Roskilde Festival  we see what happens when people meet each other with open arms  greet each other with open hearts. To us  this is the stuff strong communities are made of. This is what happens when we meet one another  we create a community. Lars-Uno and Hussam and all the rest of us. You cannot understand someone without giving that someone a chance. This is something we can all do in the name of equality.  That’s why we are supporting Kompis Sverige this year  a Swedish organisation that is approaching integration and immigration from an important yet simple angle: the meeting between two people. Friendship. The idea behind Kompis Sverige is quite simply to match established Swedes with new Swedes.  This is a way for these new Swedes to get to know both the Swedish language and society  and for the established Swedes it’s a unique chance to get closer to a different culture. More importantly  though  it’s a chance for both parties involved to get close to one another  to understand one another  to potentially become good friends. It’s all about openness and community.  You can help out  too. Our “Making a Change” ticket costs 200 DKK more than the regular festival ticket  and this amount goes to Kompis Sverige in full. If you support Kompis Sverige with the “Making a Change” ticket before 5 March  we will donate an additional 400 DKK for each ticket sold. Thank you for making a change with us.,43
We hope to see you next year then! ,0
Only refundable containers are allowed and max 50cl.,0
You are allowed to bring up to 0.5 liters of alcoholic drinks to the festival site as long as the packaging isn’t glass. ,0
No lid,0
Im not sure but I guess this http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4235,0
DRINKS ON THE FESTIVAL SITE You are allowed to bring one drink of your own choosing onto the main festival site in a container of up to 0.5 litres. The container must not be made of glass and must be accepted by the festival’s refund system to help minimise waste and the environmental impact as much as possible. Empty drink containers of any shape and form can be brought onto the main festival site  as long as they are not made of glass. Read more at http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#FUI7d0LyBg6jxaMs.99,0
Yeah. The question is what they regard as refundable. Its a bit unclear what they mean. I dont think you can bring bottles in.,0
I think :D,0
How is the waiting list on the tickets working? Is there an hope for getting a ticket through that system?,0
It's Billetnet who controls the waiting list. We'll try to look into it tomorrow when they open their office. ,0
The waiting list is still open  but there are very many people on it  so unfortunatly we don't think you should get your hopes up too much. There are still one-day tickets available though. If you have specific questions about the waiting list  please contact billetnet  as we don't have access to it from here.  http://www.billetnet.dk/event/roskilde-festival-2014-one-day-ticket-Billetter/373937,0
The classic Roskilde Festival tents travel all over the world! Here  a family camps on a balcony in London during OL 2012 - that's what we call festival spirit! Grandma Inga H. Nielsen saved the day with a festival tent. What places have your Roskilde Festival tent visited? Show us!,7
Haha OL  you do probably mean OG as in Olympic Games.,0
Anders Østerlund Larsen:  Olympic Games  yes - and not the Danish abbreviation  OL . We stand corrected :-),0
a former ski instructor ofcourse  Rock On!,0
Can someone tell me when will the days the acts will play on specifically be announced? Thanks.,0
Well first they have to annonce all the bands... So april or may maybe.,0
Ok  thank you. Awesome t-shirt btw!,0
Moin when can we announce again next Bands expected........,0

Any chance of tim minchin?,0
The Moth Gatherer. Innocent plug...,0
Myrkur is a fair guess given she's female and def got RF potential.,0
Bruce Spingsteen thank you  he will be In Europe ??,0
Can we get some Slaves  and Wing (singer)?,0
Call it a hint or whatever  just want you to know that Bråvalla earlier today released At the Drive-In as a new act.  Booking them would be a stellar way of saying: Sorry that we couldnt get Rage against the Machine to Roskilde in 2008  but we one-upped that and booked ATDI for 2016.   )  Thanks in advance Viktor.,0
Awesome. Hoping we will get some big legend this year :),0
Roskilde Festival - you know Rise Against and Roskilde Festival are made for each other  right? (RA are very political  vegetarians and against drugs  etc.),0
They are more than welcome - each and everyone of them would get a hug.,0
They're not a band at the moment – they're taking a break.,0
He plays a concert in Parken late July  so he won't be at Roskilde.,0
Miracles do tend to happen  when you least expect it??,0
They are not touring this year,0
I know... but miracles do tend to happen  when you expect it the least...,0
Then book them! :D,0
They're unfortunately not touring at the moment. Otherwise we would have given it our best shot!,0
They play some concerts in Wisconsin in mid July.  Your best shot  would be getting them to Europe just for Roskilde  as you have done with others before.  ),0
No  but I will be at Roskilde. ??,0
Ok. You guys need to make this happen at Roskilde -16.,0
Looks like no Boss at #RF16 :-(,0
Get this to preform at rf#16!,0

Thou art quite indispensable We need you at our festival!  -------------------------------------  Thanks for helping us choose the type of beer for our Food Court at Roskilde 2016.

Can't we also have some of the Golden Ale on the side?,0
Great!! I'll feel right at home.... When will you announce some new names?,0
It won't be long,0
Great  because we are feeling anxious after the releases in Belgium for Werchter and Werchter classic...,0
In food court you can have all the ale money can buy.,0
We've got loads of good stuff coming. We've only announced 54 out of 175 acts so far,0

I could use some warm up bands soon. You actually did fantastic last year (BBL  Yung  Entrepreneurs  George Best and more!!)  so maybe I should just shut up  BUT what  about some of these danish acts  that I've been lucky to catch recently:  https://www.facebook.com/aksglaededk/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/cphdenise/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/theritual.dk/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/theelectricelephants/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/DisarraySon/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/dtroitcph/?fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/franklinzoofb/?fref=ts  Counting down.,0
Of course. But only for Get A Tent East - Central opens on Wednesday 2 July 2014 at 12:00 ,0
We’re experiencing extremely long queues on the motorway and approaching roads towards the festival in both directions but especially from western and southern Denmark. So if you’re choosing that way of transportation you need to be patient.  We suggest you make use of the public transportation – for more information visit http://www.dsb.dk/roskilde. Alternatively  wait a few hours before heading for the festival.,30
The fence is still standing. No reason for panic. The camping area will open at 6 pm.,0
Aye we're coming,0
The best fest ever:) we at Southeast Europe loves it and coming:),0
Anyone able to offer a ride to Roskilde on Tuesday early evening? Please please let me know. Thanks :),0
Been there  done that,0
Get here earlier next year !!,0
Drake's playing - so no worries. ,0
Get A Tent Central area is north of Orange Stage at Darupvej. The area opens Wednesday 2 July 2 at 12:00. When you arrive you need to wear your festival wristband. The easiest way to get this: Arrival by train: Take the train from Roskilde Station (track 7) to the festival Entrance Platform (Camping West) and get your wristband here. Available until 21:00 every day (Thursday 21:30). Hereafter available at Entrance West. Arrival on Wednesday 2 July (12:00 to 00:00) or Thursday 3 July (08:00 to 17:00): During this time you can get a festival wristband at Get A Tent Central. Arrival at night after Thursday 3 July: Here you can still get a wristband at the Entrance Platform (Camping West) when you arrive by train. If you do not arrive by train you will get your wristband at the main entrances at East or West. See a map of the festival To get your tent refer to the wardrobe at the entrance of Get A Tent Central  show your voucher and staff will guide you to an area. You will also receive access wristbands for the people joining your area Small: 2 wristbands  Medium: 4 wristbands) It is also possible to get extra wristbands to Get A Tent Central but the need for those will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This also applies for broken or mishandled wristbands. In all cases the person with the vouchers must refer to the wardrobe. Important info: The reception desk at check-in is open 24 hours a day  but we encourage you to visit between 07:00 and 23:00. Pavilions are NOT allowed in Get A Tent Central area Tents/units are designated from one end to another. If you want areas next to each other  please arrive as a group.,0
We are bunch of extremely excited campers going to Get A Tent Central on Wednesday - with the intention of getting tents besides eachother of course. But unfortunately  not everybody are able to be there at 12 when the area opens. How many tents can be reserved pr. person  provided that he/she has all the needed tickets?,0
With alle the tickets you can get all the tents at once.,0
What Peter says is correct. ,0
Thanks! ...To be absolutely clear  one person with 10 Get a Tent tickets can reserve 10 tents? How/where do the designated 'inhabitants' of the tents (arriving later) get their Get a Tent wristbands?,0

Boney M,0
Well He's bin in a couple of great bands really  so he can bring some of those fellas. If he where to bring someone from the current program  it would be fun to see what he and Vince Staples could work out  and if Staples should decline his offer  or before he tries to make it  he should try to contact Tenacious D! It would surely bring some energy to the opening :D,0
can you please give us a german rock band like sportfreunde stiller or jupiter jones? thx,0
Raury  Kendrick  FKA Twigs  Years & Years  Mac Miller (y),0
Gorillaz and blur would be nice.,0

Thought so :-) cheers for the reply! Getting that ticket Monday  11th time!,0
I Mangler stadig Robyn  Gossip og Florence and the Machine!,0
The Syrian National Orchestra has performed with Damon Albarn at Roskilde Festival once before. In 2010 they guest starred the amazing Gorillaz show on the Orange Stage.   In 2016 they will reunite for a very special opening show on the Orange Stage. We expect an extraordinary  fun and moving show that will give you something to think about. To open the Orange Stage with a Syrian orchestra alongside a large group of Western musicians exemplifies how music and culture can make people come together and overcome borders and conflicts.,16
Roskilde: a Damon Albarn festival.,0
still have 1 Get A Tent Central Area left over - near Orange! You can have it for cheap - 500 DKK instead of 770  - otherwise I would throw it away.... Dear Festival: yes I tried it with Billetnet but they won't accept my credit card... sorry. feel free to delete this....,0
It's over one month ago since Anders wrote on Orangepeeling.com - lets have a blog soon please! It's interesting Reading! :),0
Come on.. bring Odd Future to Roskilde 13' ,0
If you look at their last performance at Roskilde (think it was 11') they kinda pissed on Roskildes rules and basicly said that they didn't obey their rules simply because they were told to obey them. Which is why I think Roskilde would hesitate to hire them. But if they would hire them I would be in the front line because  damn son  that act was fucking crazy!,0
When you are unable to come at the Roskilde festival  you will find a game and you will build your own Roskilde festival!  Have a great festival!,0
Bring Tuesday Forgets to roskilde 2013! ,0
The Travelettes like Roskilde Festival  ),0
Godt lavet med Kendrick Lamar :) ... System Of A Down  Macklemore & Ryan Lewis og A Day To Remember... Please...,0
Kendrick Lamar will play Roskilde Festival 2013.  Straight outta  mad city  Compton  California  Lamar builds on a proud hip hop tradition and we can't wait to see him at Roskilde 2013.  Earlier today we also announced Hatebreed  Jake Bugg  Rokia Traore and Scottish electronic label Numbers (bringing 7 acts).  See the band list (we're building up to a total of 200 acts): http://roskilde-festival.dk/music,129

I have played Skagen festival many times but not Roskilde yet. I hear it's a great festival.,0
have a great festival again folks!,0
What about The Pixies at RF 2016.... They are on Tour ??,0
Hatebreed is our fourth announcement today.  The Americans breed their own monster with balls of steel  iron gills and fiery eyes. ‘Celtic Frost hardcore’ front man Jamey Jasta dubs the genre  conveying a mix of thrash and hardcore.  Previously we've announced Jake Bugg  Rokia Traore and Scottish label Numbers (bringing 7 acts).  We'll be back at 13:00 with today's fifth and final announcement.,26
THANK YOU!!!!!,0
NOW WE'RE FUCKING TALKING!,0
I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHIT! This will be the greatest summer ever!!!,0

Hatebreeed! :D,0
Heeeell year!!!!!!! \m/,0
@Kevin Svalebech Anderson - Watch out  we've got a tr00ist/kvltard over here!,0
Jake Bugg is our third announcement today.  The young Brit has taken the stage as a young Bob Dylan. His songs take the best of 60s folk and 90s Brit rock and mould their own melodic blues.  Previously we've announced Rokia Traore and Scottish label Numbers (bringing 7 acts).  We'll be back at 12:00 with today's fourth announcement (out of five).,63
this hurts good!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Not bad,0
Så mangler vi bare Ben Howard og Passenger. Then we're good to go!,0
Well you can't have it all.,0
:D :D :D :D,0
Fantastisk! :-D,0
Brill...bringing thought of the 60s and 70s...nice sound...feel good sensation  -),0
love the first one,0
Kinda offended by the comparison with Dylan. Jake Bugg is cool  but way to structured. You should have wrote The Beatles instead. Anyway  a young Bob Dylan will always be way to big of a compliment for any new artist of our time. Juuuust sayin :),0
Give it up for Numbers - a Scottish electronic label who bring 7 acts to Roskilde Festival 2013: Rustie  Jackmaster  ONEMAN  Spencer (Numbers)  Deadboy  Redinho and SOPHIE MSMSMSM.  On this Roskilde tour de force we get techno  electro  hip hop  UK funky  dubstep - you name it.  Earlier today we've announced Rokia Traore. We'll be back at 11:00 with today's third announcement (out of five).,7
this is why u are the best festival,0
Rustiee AND Baauer at the same festival??? fuck yesssszzz,0
Have just been checking the soundcloud page  sounds promising! Will look forward to Jackmaster...,0
not my kind of music,0
YESSSS. Deadboy and Redinho <3,0
Martin Smidt  Can you back up that a bit? How is booking a relatively small scottish record label  selling out ?,0
Sigurd Moe Nyquist: I do not think of  numbers  in general  but at Roskilde Festival is far away from what the festival once stood for  namely ROCK! Rihanna  do i need too say more....? Roskilde Festival has gradually turned into a big beach party. Have been at the festival for the last twenty years  and im getting fuck biiiiig time!,0
Martin -> you just like others rember like shit... Robbie Williams was a headliner when leif was the boss.. even AQUA play on Orange when life Leif was booking. http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/history/ <-- go spend some time there,0
And I bet you smell like shit! Have a nice beach party everyone!,0
Martin Smidt Vinther  feel free to have an opinion but we don't want that talk in here.,0
Martin smidt: whoa I like your mature  comeback . Great to see a post like that and the never ending rage towards Rihanna. Did you know she is the ONLY act for your so-called  beachparty ? No i did not either. Have fun whereever you spend your vacation :),0
Oh look  it's this post again.,0

ITT: People who can't read.,0
I vote for this one Brown Ale,0
Brown Ale - no doubt,0
Belgian Amber Ale (y),0
Belgian AA  though i like more the borown A.,0
I wrote a Shakespearean sonnet in iambic tetrameter in honour of the Golden Ale! Voters  Assemble!  O Golden Ale  thy hops are strong Thy malt deserveth praise and song Thy bitterness shall soon caress Our palates shall be truly blessed  Thy title shall be King! Or Lord! Thy name shall sound throughout the court where revelers shall surely say: “O praise our darling IPA”  So let no vote be cast in vain The food court shall be your domain  Ah  let no voter stand alone Cast down pretenders to thy throne!  Thou art quite indispensable We need you at our festival!,0
Belgian Amber Ale (Y),0
Will I have 4 times the chance to win  if I like all 4 pictures?,0
I vote the beautiful golden ale!,0
Brown Ale! ...and thus I clothe my naked villainy  with old odd ends  stolen forth from holy writ  and seem a saint  when most I play the devil....,0
I prefer the Brown Ale :),0
Golden Ale! It sounds delicious <3 <3 <3 <3 Emil Aarestrup Emilie Kirstine Larsen Lind,0
The belgian amber ale! ??,0
Can we vote as a page as well? :),0
Graham O'Brien,0
Belgian Amber Ale all the way!??,0
Being a Belgian I like all the 4 beers  -)...Unfortunately my experience here is  that you need an DK or Scandinavian credit card to buy these beers? I couldn't pay in cash at the bars?,0
Best idea ever! Why not all four?,0
Difficult choise. If it's going to be a hot and sunny festival this year then I would go for Golden Ale  on the other hand  if it's going to be cold and wet  the Brown Ale would be the better choise. Ah - all the choises we face! Well  lets cross our fingres for yet another warm and sunny festival  the Golden Ale it is then!  And I have  done so already  :-),0
Emilie Enok Frederiksen :D,0
Vienna Lager... because if i win and get the chance to get there i'd wonder what it taste like since i dont know it despite being from vienna :P,0
Patricia Juul Ryberg Charlotte Ryberg Steffen Juul Haabendal-Jessen Eva M. Frederiksen <3 Se her...,0
A far too small fraction of humanity enjoys dark ale..,0
The Belgian Amber Ale makes my balls tingle. So  that is my choice,0
Cannabis is illegal on Roskilde Festival even its much less harmful than alcohol. Why is Roskilde Festival flashing the worlds most dangerous drug like this and ban the less harmful cannabis?,0
Belgian Amber Ale- what else? ... With an ingredient as ROCK candy this should be a perfect beer for Roskilde Festival????????,0
100% Brown ale  that is some duty stuff  and i like the sweet tast!?? + i have liked the pic??????????,0
Brown ale is the one to choose!,0
Good to see Jacobsen back at the festival this summer. The 2014 brew was great. Now bring us the Belgian amber ale!,0
Last year  I brought some of their Brown Ales to my camp but I would prefer a cold one (y),0
Vienna lager. A masterpiece,0
Vienna Lager - unfortunately my lyrical talents won't give you another Shakespearean sonnet  instead a Haiki-poem will have to do:  Vienne Lager  supports orange feeling terrifically.  Have a fine and dandy day!,0
the golden ale please,0
Golden Ale :D,0
Sounds like a fair deal ??,0
Belgian Amber Ale will be the best on #rf16,0
I like the Belgian Amber Ale :) hope to buy at few on RF16 :),0
Axel Milo Rob get yo'self some free tickets,0
Vienna? No. Golden? No. Brown ale? No. Belgian? No. But  which beer do you want? All beers!!!!! /Beermonster,0

So  how are things on the mud front?  I'm coming from Perth  Western Australia and have seen that it's going to be raining this week?  Is it worth bringing gumboots?,0
It's always a good idea to bring them. ,0
It will not rain at all. In fact it will be very dry.,0
If you arrive Sunday evening or Monday you don't get a temporary wristband - you get a real one. The temporary ones are just for the eager festival-goers who want in as fast as possible. Shortly after it's back to normal.,0

DISKO-DISKO-PARTIZANI!! Please bring back the beloved Shantel & The Bucovina Club Orkestar! 2010 was my first year at Roskilde Festival and I remembered the name  Bucovina  from somewhere earlier telling my friend that we should get there. We were exhausted and decided to leave the Prodigy concert at Orange Stage.   While leaving I checked the program and started reading your introduction of Shantel & The Bucovina Club Orkestar  and then we went straight to Arena Stage just in time for the start. It's not the best music I've experienced but we had a blast and stayed till the end of it. Definitely a fun concert and a great party  and definitely one I will remember for a long time.   I would place them in the category of  world music  and since they received some world music award by BBC  I would reckon it to not be far from consideration.  And also  bring back Dubioza Kolektiv! I believe I missed the concert last time they were at Roskilde Festival.,0

What Peter said.,0
Soo  problem... If you forgot your printed ticket but have your entrance booking  can you enter today and get the temporary wristband? Or is it sufficient to show the ticket on your phone?,0
RF has said that you need a printed copy. You might not be able to enter before 20-21 tonight ,0
You should talk to the help desk at the entrances.,0
It seems that some service guards have been misinformed. All of area E is dedicated to Clean Out Loud and it's full.,0
Does anyone know how big the bottles are in the Drink Package? ,0
70cl alcohol and 1.5l soda.,0
What Fredrik said.,0
Thank you,0
That deal is silly good,0
Marius that looks like a normal ticket with access to the normal campsite. It'll be packed  but you should be able to squeeze in a tent somewhere.,0
Like Fredrik said you have to print,0
The pre-sale of parking tickets has stopped. You can buy onsite.,0
You have to print.,0
That is incorrect. All of E is reserved for Clean Out Loud,0
Tomorrow we add more music to the lineup.  Still working out some details. In the meantime  you can chew on this.,19

All I hear are excuses! How bouts I meet you there  I could really do with some sunshine and sweet tunes!,0
Marius  what kind of add-on ticket have you bought - if it's Get A Tent/Get a Place a tent/spot will be waiting for you. If it's normal camping we're sure you can squeeze in somewhere.,0
Anton Demant Olin  that's not the plan  no.,0
Do it!!,0
Thor Bruun  what does this mean exactly?,0
Julien Diy  do we sense a bit of prejudice here?,0

Is there gonna be any Jazz/fusion acts this year? or is it only electronic music? :),0
What exactly do you mean? We have lots of non-electronic music in the lineup already.  We usually don't book straight jazz bands - but from time to time you do hear jazz in some kind of fusion with other genres.,0
Oh sorry i forgot to write  gloria   i ment in gloria not in general :-),0

Indians sounds awesome. Perfect to get the indie-scene going,0
F'ck this  I am going to Northside.,0
Christian  we hope you get well - and when you do  you should give Pää Kii a listen as it really rocks our socks off - even though we don't understand what they're singing (being the Finnish language). But the music's a wonderful universal language.,0
Here's a starting point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Z7Qs4lWNo&list=PL908DDCA96ECE55FA,0
pää kii on paras,0
Roskilde Festival: My main problem with the booking (and the previously announced The Bots) is that they operate under some assumption that punk died in the 80's and therefore insist on playing the same style as back then. I don't know why you keep booking indie rock bands that push music boundaries but all your punk bookings are so backward-looking.,0
Christian: Even Iceage  who already has played Roskilde twice? Who should they book?,0
Even Iceage  fuckin' dull as hell. If I was in charge  bands such as Red City Radio  The Menzingers  Polar Bear Club A Wilhelm Scream (these guys would fuckin' blow Roskilde away)  Against Me!  Make Do and Mend  No Trigger and The Bronx would've been sure bookings (of course  in a perfect world you'd also have a ton of pop-punk acts  but here I've focused on the more  rough  sounding bands from the current scene).,0
Christian: I could also very easily reel off a list of names  I want to see at the festival. None of the bands you list seem to be touring Europe around Roskilde though  which makes it wishful  but hardly realistic thinking. I fucking love The Bronx though. I would be so stoked if they came along with Rocket from the Crypt and Against Me!.,0
Well  you asked :) but then  that's also beside the point I was trying to make  that Roskilde's punk bookers seem to be unnecessarily backwards-looking. Still  lots of bands haven't been announced yet  so here's hoping!,0
If I were to make a punk list similar to that regardless of which bands are touring or not  I'd go for something like Sonic Avenues  Butter the Children  The Men  California X  FF  Hundred Visions  Parquet Courts  The Psyched  Ed Schrader's Music Beat  Thee Oh Sees  Something Fierce and Mind Spiders. My best bet is that we will see at least a couple of those bands in the lineup. I can't really figure out what exactly makes a punk band forwards- or backwards-thinking myself. I see your point with Pää Kii who are decidedly retro though.,0
Roskilde. What R U doing? ROSKILDE. STHAP,0
Christian -> Pää Kii is in all ways push music boundaries for what punkrock is.... dont see the point in your hate.. seems like your are just hateing for not getting the band you want,0
I agree. Pää Kii might be a throwback to traditional Ramones style punkrock but it think they  without understanding their lyrics mind you  add humour and quirkiness that makes the sound fresh and inviting to a modern audience without losing their roots. It's a definite must-see in my book.,0
I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show a few days ago and was amazed at the results. Today is my 8th day being on the program and I am 11lbs down!!:) I just want others to know when something works.

Please announce Radiohead!!! The rest of Europe gets to see them around the time of the festival. Give them to us  Please!!!!!!!!!,0
They have been pretty clear  that Radiohead doesn't appear to be available to the festival this year.,0
Turn the volume up a notch or two cause the weekend is coming up. Which #RF16 song is on your Friday night playlist?,7
So... They're playing in James' house  but when will they play in your house?,0
Perhaps you should consider letting Daft Punk play at your house?  ),0
Unfortunately we don't have the answer  Martin. You are more than welcome to ask them.,0
I'll write them an e-mail then. I will post any answer here. Can I say it's on your behalf?  -),0
Martin. Great idea. Send them an e-mail. You should send it on your own behalf  they'll probably like that. You could probably include quite a few thousand other Roskilde-goers  who want the same thing.,0
What? For real?,0
I think they'd love to. Problem is that Daft Punk hasn't played any shows for nearly a decade now  and probably won't until maybe their next album or the one after that...,0
We should sign a petition! Petitions always help #sarcasm,0
Please book The Gaslight Anthem ,0
Listen to the man!,0
Service announcement! Buy your ticket before 1 March and save 100 DKK,11
Jane: Well  for a lot of people 100 DKK is a lot  so we wanted to give a heads up before we just cranked up the price and put on an evil laugh :-),0
No other festival has Orange Feeling  though. While I disagree that 100 DKK is a lot  considering what you spend during the Roskilde weekend  it's always nice to save a few kronor.,0
@Motakz: 1790 DKK (approx. 240€) +fee. Read more here -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/buy-before-1-march-and-save-money/,0
@Rasmus: With the Billetlugen fee it's 1810 DKK if you buy the ticket before 1 March. After that its 1910 DKK.,0
Mikkel: Primavera has a really good  albeit extremely indie-centric lineup. If you really want to compare the two objectively  they present around 130 bands at the price of 1.300 DKK. Roskilde presents around 200 bands at the price of 1.900 DKK. Roskilde is thus cheaper per band.  The thing is  ticket prices differ vastly across the European countries. It's not just the lineup that determines it. Tickets for Hovefestivalen and Skanderborg are for example both more expensive than Roskilde's  while a festival like Dour in Belgium presents a similar lineup to Roskilde Festival (ie. a couple of hundred bands  massive variety in genres) for about half the price of Roskilde's. On the other hand  Northside  who Roskilde gets compared to a lot  will end up with only 40-45 names for 1.100 DKK.  If cheap festivals are your thing  why not check out Off in Poland? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_Festival ... ticket price about 300 DKK.  Roskilde's 2013 ticketprice (as of March) is btw. only 100 DKK more than it was in 2009. That's a 1 5% increase per year – less than the average annual inflation  so actually Roskilde has become CHEAPER over the past four years.,0
Købte for to mdr. siden. Hehe :-D,0
@Martin: Glad to hear that it's no biggie  because: You can also buy the 'Make an Even Bigger Difference'-ticket (yes  we have a ticket that's named exactly that) if you want to pay 100 DKK more for the tickets  to support projects that give young people in developing countries influence on the society -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/ticket/ticket_in_instalments/ That could be cool,0
Otherwise - as always - all our profit goes to charities  so whatever you are buying  and whenever you are buying it  you are helping us make the world less fucked :),0
@Martin: Nice words Martin. Thanks for the input - and yes  after 9 days of party and music it all adds up. Hope to see you again some day.,0
Isnt it possible to pay on another day in the month than the 1 of every month? I Get my money every month the 15,0
Matz Georg Aagaard Sonstad  sorry  no. It's all a matter of budgetting :-),0

Perfect  Thanks for the swift reply  ),0

s there going to be camping area this year like the H&M reboot camp last year ?,0
More news on this soonish.,0
Get your camp on the 2013 festivalmap!  HOW?: Go to the second Dream City 2013 workshop and get in 100 days before Roskilde Festival opens.  Sounds insane? It is. Read more about the workshop here -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/put-your-camp-on-the-festivalmap/,11
Does this mean that enormous quantities of the Camping Area East (and maybe West) again this year will NOT be available to the general audience?  But instead reserved in advance to a plethora of 16-year olds/climate maniacs  who one would suspect could handle a couple of hours in a line?  And will it again not be marked on the map  so that our carefully planned camp will again be moved friggin' miles away from the festival area? If so  then **** ****** ******. very much!,0
Is there going to be camping area this year like the H&M reboot camp last year ?,0
Conny: More info about this will follow in a few weeks,0
Søren Smertestiller Jakobsen: Everyone can move into Dream City  you don't need to be 16 or want to save the climate  -) And there'll be plenty of room for normal camps as well in the East and West areas (if there exists such a thing as  normal camps  at the festival). The area will also be marked beforehand both on the Dream City website and on the festival grounds itself. Sorry to hear that your camp was moved last year nevertheless. That's never cool,0
Get a tent ftw!  ) Thanks for moving that area closer to the festival grounds this year!,0
My Sällström Holm  as Anders wrote  we demand that all food stalls have one vegetarian option. It is also true that some of them so far has served french fries as that option. This year  we have specified that that is NOT acceptable and in our continuous dialogue we encourage them to make a real dish.   We are also working on opening a new food area this year where we want to change our participants' and our own idea about what festival food can be. There will be several vegan options there. We will tell you more on this when details are sorted out.  In 2012 there were also two options on cooking during the warm-up days with fresh organic seasonal vegetables and culinary guidance  Madkulturen's FOODjam and KBHff's Street Kitchen. Hopefully both  but at least one of them  will be back in 2013 all 8 days.  If someone would like to write a vegan's guide to eating at Roskilde Festival  we will be HAPPY to supply the information needed!,0

It's time to Orange up your phone!

The map sucks! The square areas are missing the numbers  and you can't tell where the showers  toilets and entrances are located.,0
When are you gonna stop making your own apps and let unofficial Robocat app become the official? 3 years  3 horrible apps - I am not even gonna bother getting this one,0
Roskilde Festival  new link to Android appetizer works much better  -) - update link in original post?,0
Appetizer works for me but not the official app:( I have a Galaxy Mega...,0
The map in appetizer seems to be from last year though. What I mean is the points of interest are not updated. For now the app is pretty useless,0
The app for iPhone is soooo slow. :(,0
App for Android keeps crashing.  Can't open anything,0
It keeps crashing when im trying to see the maps  im on Android,0
I really like the pixelated map that lacks camping area numbers. It adds to a great experience.,0
The numbers are missing. :-/,0
There are a difference between the schedule for the sunday acts. Which are correct  the schedule on the homepage or the schedule on the app?,0
We recommend you all to use the map in appetizer. iphone: http://splt.cc/appetizer. android:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.roskildefestival.appetizer&hl=en),0
Kasper and Louise  try this link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.roskildefestival.appetizer&hl=en,0
What is so horrible? ,0
Jonas Christensen  you should try this new one. It's actually quite good.,0
Sonia You can choose what the map shows eg. toilets  showers etc.,0
Rasmus  thanks. Will do.,0
Conny  we will look into that.,0
What about the numbers for the camping area? Like C32?,0
Thanks! Really want to use it this year:),0
Same here.,0
Martin  we'll get it fixed,0
Robert. we'll get it sorted,0
Rene Poulsen  presale of parking tickets stopped yesterday - as long as they're available we're selling them on site.,0
Thank you! :-),0
same here,0
I'll give that its faster and more streamlined that the previous ones - good job on that. You even copied Robotcats way of showing the schedule  which is good. But it's just  too much content and navigation is a hazzle - 3  clicks  and then swiping all over the place to see which band is playing where. Robotcat had that in one click and swipe. But again  huge improvement  so I guess I throw tiny thumbs up:-),0
Same here,0
same here,0
We are working on updating the app. The schedule on the homepage is the correct one.,0
Here’s a ticket status.  On Wednesday 2 July at 23:59 we change from pre-sale to door sale  which means higher prices. One-day tickets will cost DKK 1 120. So if you want to buy a one-day ticket  do it now. Saturday tickets will probably sell out before then  so act fast on those if you’re interested.  Tickets: http://po.st/RF14ticket,49
Release ticket for full festival I want to buy,0
Wait  when did you announce the Tuborg Summer Package?? I have completely missed that,0
How is it possible to sell out beer?,0
I have a question  my ticket doesn´t say wich entrance i have... WTF?,0
Is it possible to buy the drink package on the festival? and where?,0
What about parking vouchers? Are they completely sold out?,0
Question: I have a  Get a tent -ticket for Get a tent East. Do we have a fixed pitch or are the pitches given to people as they come on a first show first served basis? I.e. should I get there early to get a good pitch or is it ok to get there on Thursday because my ticket will give me access to a tent on a fixed pitch?,0
Can anyone visit the   Get A Tent East - camp or is restricted access to those who actually live there?,0
Why all the one-day tickets are not on-hold in the system now?,0
I'm on the waitinglist for 2 tickets on Thursday!  is it possible? is there a God?,0
Christian Bøggild Otte  22 days ago: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/treat-your-camp-to-a-cold-one-1/#I0YpXbj0mBYyFRom.97,0
It wouldn't. You have to buy a separate ticket for that,0
You have to book that individually...,0
But from monday at 12.00 (if i remember correctly) camping opens for all,0
But i recommend you to book an entrance NOW if you plan on being reasonably close to the festival area,0
But my ticket says i enter tomorrow.. but  i don´t understand,0
If i'm right  without entrance ticket you'll have to wait until all the folks with entrance ticket gone into the camping area...,0
I have a normal full festival ticket... says i can enter 29 :S,0
Goddangit to heck :/,0
Alex you obviously don't listen to the people trying to help you. You have to buy another ticket if you want to enter the Festival tomorrow. The tickets are called Entrance Bookings. You can find them here: http://www.billetnet.dk/search/Roskilde+Festival+entrance+booking?keyword=Roskilde+Festival+entrance+booking&language=en-us&brand=dk_rf,0
... my ticket says i enter tomorrow,0
Just that offer that is sold out. It includes more than just beer.,0
It''s the pre-order beer package. You can still buy beer at the festival.,0
after the ppl that booked entrance yes,0
You can enter tomorrow. You just have to wait until everybody with entrance tickets have entered. That usually takes a few hours. You can use any entrance you like,0
ok i don´t know  my fucking ticket says  include the entrance at campsite 29 june kl 18,0
Katrine Kolbye Rasmussen  they are not sold out - but it's not possible to buy them i pre-sale any longer.,0
Frederik Friis  no  only in pre-sale.,0
how big are the Rum and Sourz bottles?,0
Oskar Asball Mörk  Both the Brugal rum and the Sourz bottles contain 70 cl,0
Cecilie Dinesen  the tents are distributed on a first-come-first-served basis,0
Good thing I ordered both  ),0
Esben Larsen  it's SOMEWHAT restricted - but if you're staying there you can get guess passes.,0
Han Xue  can you elaborate? We've just tested and we don't experience any problems.,0
Roskilde Festival I want to buy one from the website  and I could not find a place to purchase. I chose a particular day (I also tried sunday)  and the number of ticket  but I cannot click on the 'look for ticket' button.,0
Han Xue  that's weird. We have no trouble whatsoever. Here are the three steps: 1) tick the type of ticket 2) Choose amount of tickets 3) Click 'look for tickets' (will remain greyed-out until you've completed steps 1 and 2),0
Roskilde Festival Problem solved! It is because I am using Google Chrome. :) Tak for det!,0
Yes you can. Children are more than welcome.,0
It's a very very long shot. There are many people on the waitinglist  and it's unlikely that somebody will sell their tickets at this point,0
Sorry  it seems that the issuing of entrance booking tickets was closed too early. We'll get on it ASAP.,0

Its properly gonna be 21 more nerdy smaller &  niche  names since smukfest is annoucing their full program the day after so whatever names Roskilde decides to announce will only have 1 day of press before Smukfest's program will take over so it will make sense so release a bunch of smaller names who would not get much press either way but im still hoping to see PsychicTv  Cabret Voltaire Holly Hernandon Savages Anohni  at some point in the release plan on this years program <3,0
Do whatever you can to get 5 finger death punch  ),0

You go to your local grocery store and want to buy something. The employee tells you to give him some money. After 10 months of waiting  you get some random groceries and maybe one out of the things you needed when you went to the store in the first place.

Prefer as in you MUST print it  or pdf on phone is allowed?,0
Niclas  as in: turn that printer on,0
What about soccer. How I can follow the Brasilian world championship in Roskilde?,0
The festival does not screen the world cup but there are multiple sport bars in Roskilde city.,0
This rule is because we want the Roskilde-goers who have been waiting and waiting and waiting at the entrances a first shot at the campsite.,0

Gives me fucking goosebumps to know he actually meant it!,0
Oh.My.God. Best experience ever,0
Don't tell anyone  but I was actually at the Lily Allen show when this shit was gong down. She was ab-fab!! :D,0
i was at Slipknot- Getting the shit kicked out of me. That show rates in top 3 of all time best concerts at Roskilde for me,0
http://youtu.be/Besih8zbraQ,0
LCD SOUNDSYSTEM!  FUCK YES!!!! :-D :-D :-D,0
Book Brian Wilson (performing Pet Sounds) :-D,0
Today's last announcement is Dead Can Dance.  The Australian act plays its ONLY concert in Scandinavia this summer at Roskilde.  Earlier today we've also announced Foxygen  Unknown Mortal Orchestra  Savages  SUUNS and Efterklang.  See the band list as it looks now on http://roskilde-festival.dk/music,31
o.O,0
This is definitely something I will need to hear. Thank you based bookers! #TYBG,0
Markus  it seems I finally get to see them...,0
Now THAT is an interesting booking!,0
Oh  that was really unexpected. Respect.,0
Nice. Really nice. Good bookings the whole week!!,0
...the most awesome booking for Roskilde in ten years!,0
NOW WE'RE TALKING!,0
OH MY FUCKING GOD!!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! :-D,0
Awesome :-D,0
I saw DCD at the Sydney Opera House last Sunday night. One of the most awesome concerts of my life. Absolutely brilliant they will be playing at Roskilde this year. Enjoy!,0
Ok. Let's get this straight. We booked Rihanna because we are confident that she will blow your mind. Maybe she will  maybe she won't. We don't know. Time will tell. We're all different - and hence  that is a big part of the 'Orange Feeling'. Difference. What we CAN say  is that the thought  OMG we can't afford this or that great band because we used all our money on Rihanna  isn't really something we actually consider in that way. Dead Can Dance is a blast and they're gonna gonna go BOOM! So we think. You might prove us wrong  but then you have to show up at their concert at RF13. We dare ya :-),0
And DCD Will BloW Your Mind !,0
In the other comments I complained a lot. But here above I said the R-word and it was Respect!  not fucking R..... @ Rhoskilde: You spelled her wrong  I like that.  -),0
First  thanks for a great festival – I am sure that the reason why it is so great is that the participants are rather demanding  so suggestions and constructive criticism should be looked positive upon – not always the case in here – and yesterday’s announcement  was the kind of bands I look for (interesting but poorly know  except Efterklang). I have a tendency to compare you with Primavera (narrower in genre  but mind blowing in finding tomorrows bands) and I hope every year that you will be more inspired by them  but of course it is your call and your festival,0
OH PLEASE LET IT BE!! :O,0
FEEEEEEEEEEEDT!!!!!! :O,0
KOM NUUUUU!!! :D,0
I don't give a fuck!! GAAAY!!,0
And the sixth announcement is Radiohead! pretty pls,0
They're not the sixth. Max. 250 000 likes on fb. Besides  they're not touring. Thom is busy with Atoms for Peace instead.,0
okay... I'm sorry for hoping,0
I think there's somewhat of a chance for Atoms for Peace though. Their album hits the shelves soon and it's a full-band followup to Thom's 'The Eraser'. It's really good.,0
I don't really care for Atoms for Peace but The Eraser was really good,0
The full Atoms for Peace album sounds a lot like The Eraser in many respects. Trust me on this.,0
WHERE have you heard the full album?,0
But The Eraser was just Thom and Amok is a collaboration so Flea's input is bound to be expressed...,0
Thom dominates it completely though. There might be a bit of afrobeat rhythm on a track or two  but really  'Amok' is the brainchild of Thom  mainly.,0
Today's fifth band announcement is Efterklang.  The Danish darlings visit Roskilde for the fourth time with a show that will cement why they are loved all over the world.  Earlier today we announced Foxygen  Unknown Mortal Orchestra  Savages and SUUNS - and we've got more coming. We'll be back at 13:00 with today's final announcement.,34
(Y),0
:D :D :D :D :D :D :D efterklang up in this bitch,0
Efterklang is a cool band  but isn't it 4th in a row? They're like the Gnags of the 10s maybe?,0
Roskilde Festival: Okay  the Gnags of the 00s AND 10s  ),0
Foxygen and UMO? I'm going.,0
Looking good - according to yesterdays teaser  todays final announcement will have 250.000 likes on Facebook!,0
The 6th name's gonna be HUUUUGE! Probably like  Psy or something. I'm so excited!,0
Oh wow. Ok. Ah. Shit. Now I need to start saving some serious monies...,0
I wish that I could go! :( I'll be in no physical condition to do so.,0
(y),0
(Y) x10,0
one of the bands i wanted to see this summer. thanks.,0
Bring @A$AP Rocky to RF  musical talent. And he Wouls be killing it!,0
PLEASE BOOK Glass Animals! I promise I will dance my ass off,0
Waiting for the first band to hit the stage.   Only 160 days to go!  Photo: Jacob Stage,6
Ready  set  go! It's time to work on your running strategy. The campsite opens in exactly 48 hours!,50
Pff - 48 hours  that's what u think :D,0
That sounds like a mistake from last year - so no.,0
A lot of people Got of the train and ran directly in and started setting up their camp. How do you avoid that happens when the people from the train are going to cross the camping area to get to the Holding area?? The only thing keeping the people from the train from cheating us from the Real line is a red/White plastic band  that anyway gets broken at six o'clock (hopefully!!) when people are aiming for camping site B.,0
hahahah :D,0
Today's fourth band announcement is SUUNS.  An advanced  adventurous rock band who love to jam deep far inside a cloud of electronica  kraut rock and post-rock.  Earlier today we announced Foxygen  Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Savages - and we've got more coming. We'll be back at 12:00 with today's fifth announcement (out of six).,2
wow  this sounds awesome.,0
MOTHERFUCKING SUUNS! YES YES YES :D,0
Kenneth: There are at least four headliners already: Volbeat  Slipknot  Queens of the Stone Age and Rihanna. Three of them have already handled Orange stage convincingly and repeatedly  and  well  if you are in any doubt that Rihanna can fill that space  then you might want to think it through again.,0
Hope 30 Seconds to Mars is one of the announcements today!!!,0
Cool bands so far today  Roskilde! Thums up!,0
I like this one too.. Keep em coming.,0
>krautrock as a genre,0
Hold your complaints untill the full list of bands is announced  then go at it for all i care.,0
Today's third band announcement is Savages.  Four black-clad punk sisters from the UK who play raw post-punk with a gory bite.  Earlier today we announced Foxygen and Unknown Mortal Orchestra - and we've got more coming. We'll be back at 11:00 with today's fourth announcement (out of six).,12
not bad,0
Well  they have only got 11K likes. How does that fit your own teaser?,0
They already explained in the teaser post that they made a mistake and that the like interval should have been 10k-250k.,0
We would like to participate to the next festival 2013 with our musicians but we dont know how to registre.,0
Today's second band announcement is Unknown Mortal Orchestra.  The Kiwi/American band delivers looks towards the 60s but add their own laid-back vibe to the acid trip. Stoned guitar rock filled with flickering sunshine  easy-going nonchalance and heartfelt tunes.  Earlier today we announced Foxygen - and we've got more coming. We'll be back at 10:00 with today's third announcement (out of six).,16
Well  we got that one :P,0
Portland  OR in the house!,0
Thank god for Foxygen!!! :D:D:D,0
Our first announcement today is Foxygen from The US.  Look forward to their psychedelic pop flowers originally found in the 60s and planted in the mould of the 21st century.  We'll be back in an hour with today's second announcement (out of six).,11
..which one was that?,0
Asbjørn Olling  we'll explain the graphic teaser later in a reply in the previous thread  ok?,0
Motakz - Slipknot is on the bill?,0
D-A-D please !!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
SYSTEM OF A DOWN,0
first great band untill now,0
thank you!!,0
Michael Beck  if you really think that  then maybe Roskilde isn't a festival for you.,0
cool (Y),0
i like that shit,0
Best band you've got so far in my book. Thanks!,0
Roskilde Festival Podcast is back. In the fourth podcast we've talked to music bookers Stefan and Claes about the #RF16 line-up  why we've booked Red Hot Chili Peppers and loads more. Treat yourself to a nice cup of coffee and give it a listen (the podcast is in Danish).,8
Daft Punk  Muse  Soundgarden  System Of A Down  RATM  2manyDJs  Zane Lowe  Knife Party give us something,0
IGORRR TO ROSKILDE 2013!!! ,0
Hello! Do you offer any contests to win tickets? I live in Texas and have wanted to attend Roskilde for years! It just takes so much to get there. ,0
We do once in a while. If you DID win a ticket  you'd still need to travel here  though.,0
The Björk competition last year included transportation as far as I recall,0
Awesome!!! I can handle transport if needed. I'll keep watching!,0
Ok  we've got something coming up soon ,0
Tomorrow we have more music announcements for you. We start at 8:00.  In the meantime  here's something to pass the time with.  EDIT: Want it hi-res? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3148995/teaser070213.jpg,13
Jesus and the mary chain?,0
Mortal Kombat  live on stage!,0
Scottish..? Let it be Franz Ferdinand!,0
Damn too late xD,0
It's riddlin' time!,0
air plane taking off!!!,0
Hymns from nineveh!,0
Yeah  the mortal combat logo with what looks like a symphony orchestra and a question mark is /probably/ Unkown Mortal Orchestra..   FUCK YES!,0
but it's gonna make it more funny  Steen,0
Unkown Mortal Orchestra  without a doubt!  :D  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNHofCE4rg,0
There are probably multiple bands  though. UMO don't seen to have a song with the phrase  time flies   and they're new zealand-american  not much to do with scotland.,0
These are pretty hard to go at methodically. The image manipulation makes it impossible to reverse image search  and they are pretty damn hard to google.,0
Pætur  I don't think it's that.. The bottom part has quotes next to it  it's probably a lyric.,0
the first one could be  holy fuck ,0
the old dude with the scottish flag might be biffy clyro (captain),0
Biffy Clyro seems like a pretty good guess. Scottish  has a (major) song called  The Captain   and their new album is called Opposites  cats and dogs count as opposites  right?,0
richard smallwood? I don't know anything about any of my guesses  i just google around...,0
This teaser is very hard but Biffy Clyro will play Northside Festival in Denmark,0
Asbjørn - except that BIffy Clyro have 700.000 likes  and the maximum we're looking for here is 250.000,0
Any chance of a high-res version? It's pretty tough to see whats going on in the first clue.,0
As for the magnifying glass and dictionary  it looks like it's focusing on the word  leap year  Year 2000 was a a leap year  but I'm not really sure to make of that. Of course it could also just be looking something up  it does look a lot like a stock photo  and it seems improbable that there would be a stock photo convenient for every word you might want to use.,0
I don t understanding think of these teasers at all,0
The leap years in the 00s decade were 2000  2004  2008..,0
The Jesus and Mary chain,0
Nearly 800k likes Tool. Could be awesome though!,0
I would guess that the last clue has something to do with  road to love/happiness  or  path of love   and  watch/see time fly . Have no idea where that leads us though...,0
I'm so lost  _ ,0
Gloria Estefan have made a track called  Path of the right love .. Just saying :D haha,0
I'm going with Neutral Milk Hotel.,0
If Scottish  let it be the Twilight Sad,0
Morten Friis  you should be able to download it to see a better version. If not  here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3148995/teaser070213.jpg,0
Songs with the text  watch time fly  or  see time fly : Lincoln Hubble - Heaven  Close your eyes  & dream up up to the sky The place where I can chill & watch time fly  by   Def Maniac - Wish is My Command  Make tunes while we really high Have fun  we young  watch time fly   Grits - They All Fall Down  To the naked  untrained eye  Who can't see time fly by   Styles P - Throw Down  Time flying and I’m ready to get my lonely on I wanna see time fly with the rollie on   None of these seem to fit.. :/ I didn't go any further then the first page of google  though. I don't count on finding anything good there.,0
Martin Bernth - exept that Avenged Sevenfold have 12.000.000 likes on FB,0
Quote Unquote Records with Binary Heart  Kevin Seconds and two others?,0
Atli: with under 250k likes?,0
Little dragon and the knife?,0
Oooh  the smudge thing next to  longlist  is the soundhound logo! How did I oversee this? http://www.symphonicdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Soundhound.png,0
No clue what that's supposed to mean  though.,0
Obviously  it's Neutral Milk Hotel. Jesus Christ? An Aeroplane? You don't fool me.,0
damn  the third one is hard. it fits Biffy Clyro so perfectly  but they have too much likes...,0
Thanks for the high-res version.  Thinking about it  the last clue could also be something along the lines of  I Watched You Taking Off  by Bright Eyes  but they played Roskilde not too long ago (2011?).,0
The  Captain  in the picture is Hugh Hefner.. Just saying :),0
Yes  and actually the first picture shown when you search Hefner in Google.,0
Maybe the first one is something from  Rise Records ?,0
i hope it's tool,0
There is a band from Rise Records callen  In Fear And Faith  would be fitting  but dunno if its to far stretched,0
Morten: They're also retired.,0
Aaaahhhh - guess  the captain is actually Hugh Scott Band II (http://www.myspace.com/hughscottband2).,0
How you found that picture of Jesus is beyond me..,0
I wish for Tool..but since Maynard has come out and said there will be no new Tool album in 2013..they're probably not gonna tour either.,0
@Morten  makes sense.. but they don't have a facebook page.,0
Also  what about the cat and dog?,0
@Anders: Damn - it fitted so well! (That picture of Hugh Hefner is also the first to show up in Google image search when you enter Hugh).,0
Could the Jesus/record pic be My Bloody Valentine? Their new album has been heralded like it was the second coming of Christ. And the cover is blue like the center of the vinyl depicted? Loooong shot.,0
Lol Anders :D didn't expect you to loose your cool  ),0
Morten: I'm talking about Bright Eyes. They're retired. Don't know Hugh Scott Band.,0
@Asbjørn: There are two of them. Also  their track Avgasröret  starts out with a dog barking :),0
WHAT IF!!... We're talking about  Hugh Hefners pets ? His pets are  bunnies ... Frightened Rabbit are from Scotland xD,0
MBV also only have around 220k likes  -),0
@Anders  it's a long shot.. but the likes fit  and I guess we all know that roskilde has excellent taste.,0
Alexander: Good thinking  and they've also got a new album out now. VERY plausible.,0
My money is on Frightened Rabbit then :),0
@Morten  they don't show up in my searches..,0
I would love to hear  Frightened Rabbit again.,0
Make it pretty good  this time i don't want more of this hipster shit. more importantly  Use your money well  instead of wasting them all on Rihanna. That's all i have to say. Peace...,0
00 + leap year: Nineteenhundredandyesterday = D-A-D ?,0
@Asbjørn: On Google? Weird. If you mean Facebook  then I can't find them either. It's probably not them. It just matched up with the picture pretty well.  Also  the image of the airplane shows up on page 2 when you search  take off  in Google images  but not when you search  plane    airplane    aeroplane    fly  or  flies .,0
Simon: So Rihanna is hipster shit? I think someone's musical compass needs readjustment.,0
@Morten: I can find them on google  but not on facebook. I'm pretty sure they have to fit with the like-range at the bottom.,0
they are on fb but to few likes https://www.facebook.com/d.landafterdark,0
@Asbjørn: You're probably right.,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXwwvDlpQsc maybe matching the last one :),0
@Simon Landler: I don't think the clues fit on Rihanna  so no worries  she won't get booked twice this year.,0
Second picture could be dragonforce  but please tell me it isn't.,0
There's definitely some Beady Eye in there. Definitely....maybe.... :-),0
The dragon with all the people: of monsters and men?,0
OK. I give up. I've spent too much time on this already. Before I go  I'll just leave a couple of comments on the last clue and for which Google image searches they show up: 1:  choose road  (4th picture) 2:  eye  (1st picture) - could mean  I  3:  stop watch  (peculiarly NOT  stopwatch ) 4:  take off ,0
This fucked my head up pretty bad :( I Hope for My bloody valentine For the first picture,0
the last one is something with  road to love  (Road-two=love) and the watch and the plain probably mean something with  time flies . Can't really put it together though.,0
http://m.voices.yahoo.com/band-rises-dead-record-time-10866919.html For first one? Don't know em,0
The third one could be Franz Ferdinand or Biffy Clyro. Biffy  headlines  the NS festival in May so he might not attend two festivals in DK this summer  even though it would be pretty awesome.,0
St. Vincent  Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Frightened Rabbit are the first three!,0
Those names arise when I click on the image  it's like they are tagged. Strange  there is also something with whitey and hurr durr im a plain?,0
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q6bc/profiles/thelonglist The Longlist logo is shown here... Pretty sure one more of these band will come,0
@Tobias: Those are tagged by fans  and have already been established in this thread :p,0
Aah  so that's why :P,0
Well  i give up... i was convinced (and still am) that the clue to the last one is the   : as if the band/album/songname is synonymous with nothing  missing  gone etc. Haven't been able to find anything... that made sense...,0
God dammit  got fooled like Tobias. I was pretty excited about St.Vincent already.,0
The religious image is the resurrection. Resurrection Records?,0
I don't think the first one is St. Vincent. The  black rainbow  is just a vinyl record.,0
I still think the jesus/vinyl picture is  holy fuck ...  Their album from 08 was named  LP ,0
CHVRCHES? Based on nothing but the link to BBC and them being Scottish. The amount of likes fit as well.,0
Which one of them is Muse??? :-),0
Going with the lead Thorvald figured out  there's a handful of possibilities. Angel Haze and King Krule are already booked. A*M*E  Arlissa  Laura Mvula and Little Green Cars don't have enough likes to fit within the range in the bottom of the teaser.   That leaves Haim  AlunaGeorge  CHVRCHES  Kodaline  Palma Violets and Peace.  Of course the teaser could also be referring to that the bands in were longlisted in the BBC Sound of... awards once in its lifetime instead of just nominees from 2013. That list goes back a few years though and the ones we already guessed aren't among these: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of...,0
Ye and the Weeknd got 633K likes  shame.,0
Could the Second one be Imagine Dragons???,0
Nah  I think they're right about Unknown Mortal Orchestra - it fits so well :),0
I have the right answer  the 5 bands are: Muse  David Bowie  Rival Sons  Maroon 5 and Immortals!!!,0
couldn't the last few pictures be connected - together it would make something like  ..watch time fly  ?,0
or does each picture fit only one band?,0
I'd say the last line is a lyric from a song by the artist in question.,0
Six new bands tomorrow and none of them is Scottish  the twitter says. So no Frightened Rabbit  I'm afraid.,0
http://hypetrak.com/images/2011/04/Mortal-Kombat-Songs-Inspired-by-The-Warriors.jpg Skrillex?!,0
The pic with the dragon is most likely Imagine dragons...,0
Picture with pets  = PET  and Hugh Hefner.. play boy = BOYS... PET Shop BOYS... .. shop.. dunno,0
I'm hoping the religious one is El-P  he's like frikking Jesus to me.,0
4.th picture  Nephew. Small in 2000. Played at the camping scene in 2000.,0
Status: You've got one out of six right so far.,0
okay this one is gonna be a looooooong shot.... nummer 5: zero dictionary  dictionaries contain words... no words.... The script has made a song called no words... OR... no words ... dont speak .... No Doubt!,0
Something to do with learning or school maybe? 00 is the second worst grade in the Danish school system  plus the word learn is visible in the magnifying glass.,0
@ Thomas... The guy making the leads has definately searched  dictionary  to tind the picture of the dictionary....,0
Frank: It's not the Soundhound logo. It's the BBC Sound of 2013 logo: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q6bc/profiles/thelonglist,0
Bloodhound Gang! :D,0
Long shot  but Hugh Hefner with the dog/cat could be Bloodhound Gang.,0
Okay people may not get my reasoning  but Godspeed You! Black Emperor??,0
There is no reasoning  Edvin :P,0
Cathrine(and nothers) rember to look at likes..  Bloodhound Gang got more then 250k,0
haha  there is - something with Jesus  and vinyl = the black,0
okay last shot at making any sense of this... http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=00 ... 00 at urban dictionary means emo ... ?! If not justice had 1.6 mio likes my guess would have been them.. double o in urban dictionary is slang for Ohio.. Justice's latest album is Ohio...,0
this is the answer to the first one I think http://www.facebook.com/om.band?group_id=0 they are infact touring in europe this summer and published by  Ressurection Records ,0
Sigurður Kiernan: What? Does Om play elsewhere than at Primavera? Their record label is Drag City  isn't it?,0
I can't really believe that we only got 1/6...  Unknown Mortal Orchestra fits too perfectly  so it has to be that one. Frightened Rabbit fit so well  though. :/  If there are six acts  then the BBC Longlist thing would have to be one act by itself.  Gee  thanks Roskilde Festival. This one is actually impossible to know for sure. It's just guessing..  A shame The Weeknd has to many likes ...,0
Oh  I can actually narrow it down a bit. The 15 BBC Longlist artists are: HAIM - 53 285 likes AlunaGeorge - 30 377 likes Angel Haze - 44 893 likes (already announced for RF) Laura Mvula - 7 689 likes CHVRCHES -  20 040 Likes A*M*E - N/A Arlissa - 10 720 likes King Krule - 22 027 likes Kodaline - 31 531 likes Little Green Cars - 10 427 likes Palma Violets - 21 688 likes Peace - 22 301 likes (what an SEO nightmare) Savages - 11 709 likes The Weeknd - 664 266 likes Tom Odell - 22 945 likes  That leaves HAIM  AlunaGeorge  CHVRCHES  King Krule  Kodaline  Palma Violets  Peace  and Tom Odell.,0
well 25 min and we will know :),0
...and none of them are playing any other Danish festivals.,0
You mean them from the BBC longlist? or the hidden Announcments from the pic?,0
Which one is Foxygen?,0
We'll give you the whole explain once all announcements are done.   One tiny error on our part  though. The 15k at the bottom should rather be 10k.,0
That broadens it a bit: AlunaGeorge CHVRCHES Arlissa King Krule Kodaline Little Green Cars Palma Violets Peace  Savages Tom Odel  A bit sloppy  RF :p,0
Asbjørn Olling  we know - sorry :-),0
But seeing as the 15k was an error  there's got to be at least one act with between 10k and 15k likes. If that act is one of the BBC Longlist ones  It would have to be Arlissa  Little Green Cars  or Savages. Of course  it could be any of the other puzzles too.,0
I'm guessing foxygen was one of the bottom two  mostly because those are the ones I don't really understand anything about.,0
Why does it say Ke$ha?,0
if you slide your mouse over the watch at the bottom,0
Alright  so the top one was savages. 1/3 is close enough.,0
Lasse: Because some fool has tagged the picture with Ke$ha.,0
I'm guessing that Foxygen was number 5. OO = 2 O's = O2 = oxygen  right? Don't know where the F comes in  but if the teaser had a fox  it would maybe have been too easy.  That leaves number 2  4 and 6.,0
My bloody Valentine will be announced in an hour.. (i hope). 220k fans  their new album  m b v  is the second coming (jesus #2 pic) yea... probably not.. but one can only dream...,0
Do we get the explanation soon?,0
Thanks a lot for your very enthusiastic guesses. It seems that we made things very difficult for you this time around. Albert Santos did get one band right - quite fast too!  Here's how we thought out our graphic teaser this time around. Each horizontal  line  referred to a band (six in total).  1) Here we've cut out the 'S' part of BBC's Sound of 2013 list to be found here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q6bc/profiles/thelonglist  and we're referring to their longlist on which SAVAGES appear.  2) A painting of the Resurrection (y'know  the one from the bible). DEAD CAN DANCE named their latest album  Anastasis   which is Greek for resurrection.  3) We took the logo from the game Mortal Kombat and placed a classical orchestra inside of it with a discrete questionmark at the bottom. These elements put together give you UNKNOWN MORTAL ORCHESTRA.  4) A photo of Hugh Hefner with a barely visible Scottish flag in his face and a couple of pets in the corner. FOXYGEN called their first single from the latest album  Shuggie . It refers to the musician Shuggie Otis  but apparently in Scotland it's also used as a pet name for Hugh (not specifically Hefner  though). Source: http://www.scotland.com/forums/language/23790-scottish-slang-help-15.html  5) This band used to be called Zeroes - that's why you see a couple of those numbers. An arrow points towards a dictionary. Reason? SUUNS is the Thai translation of the former band name Zeroes.  6) We're looking for a quote. That's what the quotation marks are hinting at. This rebus is supposed to guide you to the lines: “Another way to your heart / It started to look like seconds / And then we're off” - taken from the song  Apples  by EFTERKLANG.,0

ROSKILDE COMMUNITY FORUM: Does the Roskilde-festival.dk site have anything to do with the Community Forum anymore? I tried to sign in and I think my credentials have expired  and I could not find a link to a webmaster anywhere. can someone please help. I am under USLANDER on the forums. I tried to reset my password but it doesn't even show my email on file  or I totally forgot which one I used. Please advise. Tak!,0
Someone got up much too early to prepare this. Luckily  he didn't misspell anything else. Sorry about this. The correct dates are at the top,0
Tom Morello have just shot these rumours down :/,0
If you want to pay your ticket in instalments (offer expires 1 March)  you choose this option in one of the final steps of your ticket purchase.,0
Today we present Tego Calderón  Chinese Man and Mokoomba.  3 acts from 3 different continents excelling in something as diverse as reggaeton  turntablism and Afro pop.  Read more: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/tego-calderon-comes-to-roskilde-festival-2013/,17
Tego Calderón is a motherfucking hardass! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NncAAq_CLWI,0
Chinese maaan :D,0
seriously! northside book modest mouse  the knifte and flaming lips! where were you there? asleep?,0
Mikkel: Flaming Lips are over the hill. Their upcoming album is shit and their 2007 performance at Roskilde was more of a circus than a concert. I agree on the other two  would've been nice to have. That being said  Tego Calderón is a great subheadliner. It's just not your genre  apparently.,0
Don't worry Roskilde  I'll be there anyway. You're in my blood! And I will go to Northside this year as suggested. Life is too short to miss a Flaming Lips gig!,0
I´ve been at the Roskilde Festival every year from 2006-2011  either as a volunteer or ticket-buying-guest. But the last years I've been thinking more and more that there isn't enough focus on presenting new rock bands. Thus I decided not to go in 2012 to save my money for the European Border Breakers Festival in The Netherlands  and I really had a nice time there with more music of my taste  so I think I'm gonna repeat that move,0
A good addition to the lineup :),0
Good morning  Roskilde. When will the next artists be announced?,0
In about an hour AND hopefully in a few days - if you catch our drift.,0
Hello Roskilde-man i've got a question. If me and a group of friends buy silent & clean pre-access  will we get room for our tents together? Or is it first come  first serve? Also  do you think pre access will be sold out before may?,0
First of all  how many are you? This is a first come  first served offer. The S&C access booking does not guarantee that you will get to stay together - you only get access  not a specific spot. But if each of you make sure to have a booking and you arrive together early  we'd say there's a fair chance.,0
Hi! Do you need to buy the south entrance booking as well  or do you just need pre-access for silent and clean? Is the pre-access to silent and clean its own entrance?,0
Hi Roskilde Festival.  This doesn't make much sense. Nowhere in the ticket buying process is it stated that you need an additional entrance booking. Are you going to let people with both a S&C pre-access ticket AND an entrance booking in from 16-18  but not people with only S&C pre-access  but no entrance booking? How is this fair?,0
Okay  thanks. We aren't that many so i think we'll be fine! Do you think S&C pre-access will be sold out before may?,0
We can't give any guarantees. Why not just book it now?,0
Got a friend who doesn't have money for it until may. I'll probably just purchase it for him.,0
Or can i buy 1 tickets with for example 5 pre-access vouchers?,0
The booking is not tied with the tickets  so you can get them seperately here: http://www.billetnet.dk/search/?keyword=roskilde+festival+special+camping&language=en-us&brand=dk_rf2,0
thanks you very much kind sir,0
If you don't mind waiting until the ones with entrance booking are in (takes a couple of hours)  then it's not necessary. Your S&C booking is valid until midnight on Saturday 25 June,0
It is stated if you do 3 minutes of research and read their website.,0
R.I.P. David Bowie  Here's a short clip from when he visited Roskilde Festival back in 1996.,258

It's not their fault  but I will never be able to listen to Slipknot again.,0
I'm still sad he wasn't able to make it in 2004. I never got to see one of the biggest stars on the planet. R.I.P.,0

Come on over this summer  then.,0
Roskilde Festival has booked exactly the right death metal band right now in Cattle Decapitation  whose latest album  The Anthropocene Extinction  we deem not just hugely relevant  but also radically different to anything that has surfaced from the genre this year:,0
If indeed LCD is back  do NOT miss that chance please! They belong at Roskilde!,0
Dear Roskilde Festival    For the love of all that is good... Please bring Guns n' Roses to Denmark!  Sincerely  Everyone!,0

Hey Roskilde. In the e-mail you sent me yesterday  you write this: You will also receive access wristbands for the people joining your area (10x10metres: 30 wristbands  5x5metres: 8 wristbands 3x3metres: 3 wristbands). Is this a mistake? Everywhere else  you write that the area is free for all?,0
Trust your e-mail. We'll get the other info corrected.,0
NOOO  that's bad. We're planning a party with lots of guests. Why did you change this?,0
Hopefully - Roskilde Festival thats not right. We have bought 10x10 meters and as Jesper points out you've stated earlier that everyone can get into the GAP camp site. So if we are 25 people only 5 people can come visit our camp if they are not staying in GAP!!! You have to solve this ASAP before people get their camps up  so that the camp guards who has to manage this will not be overrun by angry GAP'ers.,0
Jesper Ernst Henriksen & Jacob Juul Gade  we checked up on this. You can ask for more wristbands on site. It may be a little troublesome but it'll work.,0
Welcome to Apollo!  Fun fact: It takes 6 minutes to inflate this thing.,54
Can i use this for my Inflatable mattress ??,0
I hate this scene with every single fiber in my body... it's the sickening and unholy lovechild of Orange Stage and Satans bouncy castle.,0
rise and shine,0
Niclas Dosdal Møller  not sure you'd be comfortable on top on this.,0
Not sure what would happen if we connected one of the 6 turbines that keeps the pumpkin inflated. Probably something explosive.,0
Tommy Christer Nilsson  our audience is international. If we communicated in Danish it wouldn't be understandable to everyone. English is.,0
Well  you didn't say no  so I vouche for you do it monday  please Roskilde!,0
well that made the roskilde festival volunteer job a lot easier xD,0
Lasse Momme  not a fan  eh?,0
I LOVE this scene with every single fiber in my body... it's the sickening and unholy lovechild of Orange Stage and Satans bouncy castle.,0
Behave  Fernando. We don't want that kind of language in here.,0
See the entrance booking map here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/entrance_booking/,0
thank you :),0
Hej Roskilde! Can you help me? I am a journalist from Canada trying to find one of the festival's veteran....like the person who has been to so many Roskildes that he doesn't have enough fingers and maybe toes to count them. I would love to make an interview with that person! Can you help me find him/her so we can meet during the festival? Tusind tak!,0
Being only my 20th Roskilde this year and not missing any fingers or toes I can still count them. But I by no means think that I'm one of the really avid goers. There's people in my camp with more Roskilde under their belt.  You're welcome to swing by the traditional chat meet. It's been going every years since 1997. Might be some of the real oldies there.  https://www.facebook.com/events/395749343897161/,0
Markus Holm  you're like 28 aren't you?,0
thank you!,0
As Peter said it's not possible to get your one-day wristband before the actual day. But we're open from 5:00 in the morning  so if you get here early you can avoid the nasty queues in the afternoon.,0
The schedulers have had a nightmare this year. Why put Black Pus  Deftones  Correction House and The Ocean all clashing with each other  and very little heavy bands on the other days? Really poorly thought out,0
Then you won't get a temporary wristband  so no need to worry. You'll just get a regular wristband to begin with. Temporary wristbands are only for those entering with entrance booking,0
Not long untill the party starts !! here is some orange feeling !! Cant wait untill the Roskilde Festival ! After this festival is over.. Roskilde - The Experience 3D is coming out ! a movie in 3d .. and 2d.  about 1.5 hours long !! stay tuned ! ,0
That's no problem.,0
Yes. With your volunteer wristband you can choose any entrance and enter on the same conditions as those with Entrance Booking.  Read more at http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/entrance_booking/entrance_booking_faq/,0
You can enter when everyone with entrance booking has entered. It won't take very long. There are still entrance bookings available though: http://www.billetnet.dk/search/?keyword=Roskilde+Festival+entrance+booking&language=en-us&brand=dk_rf,0
When Will the rest of the acts be revealed?,0
Late March  early April  most of the names are usually revealed with an additional handful or two trailing after them.,0
Later in the year,0
Sorry Atli  Guns N' Roses isn't playing Roskilde in 2016.,0
Ok but i hope we will get some good and big rock band. New acts soon :)?,0

Hi Roskilde!  Earlier it has been possible to make your own schedule for the festival. It is not an option this year - is it something that will come soon or shall the lazy Mathias write it down by himself?  Best regards and wishes for the best weather,0
JonasForFanden will kickstart the party at Roskilde Festival 2014 on Sunday at 20.00 in Street City with the very first live show of this year's festival. And he has even promised a few surprises for you. On Monday at 20.00 Lord Siva takes the stage in Street City. See you soon!,17
Still don't really understand which is the easiest way to reach get a tent central on wednesday. We are walking from the caravan camp. Is it possible to get there from Darupvej?,0
Is it possible for me to use my entrance booking more than once  if I have to leave the waiting area? This would be nice to know  but is not listed on your FAQ :) Thanks!,0
Are we going to get an overview of the waiting areas? Not the locations (we see those just fine) - but the actual areas they will occupy?  It would be nice to know how much of the camping site is going to be unavailable while the waiting areas are up. Thank you. Roskilde Festival,0

Unfortunately  Chromeo have to cancel their European tour  including the Roskilde gig  due to personal reasons. Shoegazer legends Slowdive(band) join the line-up instead.  More info: http://po.st/RF14Slowdive Band schedule: http://po.st/RF14schedule,47
Fucking bullshit. Get me a better substitute!,0
Lucky guys. They were IMMENSE at Primavera.,0
:o,0
WTF NO,0
Too late for me anyways. At 2.30 Ill be ZZZzzzzzzz  ),0
It's alright. I like Slowdive much more than Chromeo! Thanx Roskilde!,0
Would have liked them both  but wow  you guys know how to book substitutes. Cheers!,0
Roskilde Festival I can't find them in the band schedule. When will they play?,0
not chromeooo!! :/,0

Shame. I will watch Slowdive  though  I'm partial to a spot of shoegaze!,0
It's pretty nice!,0
Saw slowdive last week  they're cool :),0
UPGRADE! LOVE IT!,0
More bad news....,0
:( Chromeo was one of the acts I looked forward to the most  if not the act! ,0
That is bullshit :( Should at least have found something more alike Chromeo to replace them!,0
What,0
Awesome! :D,0
Am not disappointed,0
This is a dream. My goodness  Slowdive.,0
Chromeo are osom  and slowdive are osom... but true dat they are def not in the same genre... but i love both and i understand peps that do not like the substitute... but well done RF  yet I feel like SLowdide just should have been on the roster from the beginning.. get Cromeo again next year  ),0
This is amazing!,0
Fantastic!!! A little worried about the timeslot considering the genre  though. Perhaps Slowdive should swap with something a bit more dancey earlier that day? Not exactly a partyband  you know...,0
Personal reasons = holidays. Nice Chromeo  so professional!,0
WTF is a Chromeo?,0
God damn it.......,0
slowdive played a supercool concert at primavera. Don't miss them,0

Keep up to date with the events at Roskilde Festival! https://www.facebook.com/Roskildeevents,0
So now since Chromeo seems to have cancelled their european tour  and presumably their gigg at RF included with that... will you a) find a suitable replacement  which seems very difficult since Chromeo is awesomly osom.... or b) use the money that is free'd up due to that cancellation and put up a frkn big screen to show the World Cup.... because if you wont find a respectably replacement you can not hide behind the money reason of cxl the tradition of showing the WC/EM football games like in the past.  MVH a curious music/football lover.,0

How cool would it be if you could book Eek-A-Mouse? Maybe a little collaboration with Malk  ),0
You totally oughta create a Spotify playlist with tracks by confirmed artists  as a teaser to this year's festival - I'd subscribe to that! That'd be so beast..,0
There is already a spotify playlist for Roskilde: http://open.spotify.com/user/113211636/playlist/0rgf5FcEoogl0YvsYvOL6c He usually update it as soon a new artist is announced.,0
I see - that's awesome  thanks!,0
Meanwhile in Denmark: Slipknot  Queens of the Stone Age  Kreator  Volbeat  The Dillinger Escape Plan  Kvelertak  Overthrow  Anaal Nathrakh  +over 160 bands not released yet  We are ready for you - are you ready for heavy?,71
My body is ready.,0
We are  and we want more metal :D,0
Rage against the machine next...,0
I believe they made this to cover up for Rihanna.. Just saying :D,0
Yep..this is absolutely a good start. Get Devin Townsend  Coheed & Cambria  Between the buried and me  Deftones  Tool  Converge or something like that in addition and I am sold :),0
Ready to die in the MOSH!!!!!,0
Throw in Slayer too. You can never have Slayer too many times  and they're in the area around that time. ,0
Since when is QOTSA heavy ? :p,0
Since their debut?,0
The festival REALLY needs to work in their graphic identity....this banner is absolutely horrible. You are a top class festival  not a garage-groups get together...,0
Come on  Bastian! The Dillinger Escape Plan bliver fucking sindsygt!,0
VERY solid lineup so far. Looking forward to the rest  ),0
avenged sevenfold rammstein bullet for my valentine,0
Knock Out Kaine !,0
Ready for heavy as in ooops adding Rihanna to the lineup wasn't a good idea now we have to make it all heavy ? Jeg glæder mig til flere store navne og til en god festival.,0
Bought my ticket yesterday! :),0
so far the only performances i give two fucks about are AC and Rihanna. Release the rest of the damn lineup already,0
This is fucking sweet! Keep 'em coming - SOAD  Rage Against The Machine  A7X  Killswitch Engage  Ko?n  MM  The Offspring  The Smashing Pumpkins  Stone Sour  Rise Against.. Any of those and I'd be blown away.,0
Søren: This specific banner was made to celebrate the heavy side of the festival (keeping in line with today's bookings)  and we though Volbeat was a bit more on the  heavy  side than QOTSA - but we're not really that much into framing bands in genres or counting fans  so pay no heed to the size of the band letters in this case. See it as our bid so far of  bands that will make your blood boil  :-),0
finally some music for the older generations. maybe this year there wont be as many bieber kids running around... oh ya.. i forgot Rihanna,0
Please release something else than heavy soon.,0
Seconded  more metal please.,0
Once  there were a festival in the Danish city Roskilde. Then Slipknot  Anaal Nathrakh and The Dillinger Escape Plan stopped by - and Roskilde was no more..,0
When everything else just isn't brutal enough!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heG6PYIQXfI,0
Well  I'm not a big fan of metal but it looks/sounds like you've made some great bookings. I hope that your next additions will be 'not so much on the heavy side'  -) Keep up the good work!,0
why da fuck Anaal are higher than Qotsa on the poster?,0
Nice try  but nobody'a going to forget the Rihanna Conttoversy.,0
What controversy? the whiners who got a booking they didn't like?,0
I m going to see all these metal and rock bands but not Rihanna,0
The excitement builds!!!!!,0
We all should pay for advertising space on Rihanna's humongous forehead!,0
you had me at QOTSA,0
Fuck rihanna ! What is going on   where are the Rock legends! It's becoming so mainstream :/,0
Hehe it is so lovely to read the many positive posts to this. It is on the other side very funny to read the few  cry baby cry    whiners  (like uhh program is awful) or (this is to cover up on the Rihanna booking). Gees people would you stop bitching about this and that (don't have the energy for translating  luk f*ssen røvsnaps ) but do that instead of complaining all the time! If these are not going to be a blast I do not know what will. Looking so much forward to this festival and the programme so far is crazy! Everything else is a bonus :-),0
Happy for all the metalheads out there and Kreator will be nice to see after 23 years .But looking forward to something different myself...,0
Sabbath  Tool and Clutch  please.,0
Rage Against the Machine needs to be on this list.,0
We are ready for you - are you ready for heavy? ??? Heavy??? OG så skriver i Volbeat!! Det vel for sjov..,0
but you like NOVARock more  right?))),0
Skaf lige Avenged Sevenfold :D,0
You should book System of a Down! They're touring Europe during the summer!!,0
Tuomas: Not until August.,0
Hi there oh you mighty festival! Will you be screening any of the world cup matches anywhere during the week?,0
Not through us  sorry,0
I will be arriving July 3  how hard is it going to be to find a  good place to pitch a tent??,0
Depends on how you define good. But there will be room for you somewhere  just don't expect to be able to find a place near the stages,0
Yea I figured as much. Thanks for the quick response.,0
From 0500 on the day your ticket is valid. You exchange it at the entrance.,0
I have been told that it's possible from sunday night and until the day it buy for.,0
What Mattias said.,0
I Am Kloot,0
And to round up todays metal bookings  we bring you:  Kreator (DE) are German metal kings who have been making the stage boil for more than 30 years. Since the early 80s  these Germans have been spitting out albums that have enshrined their sound in the thrash genre DNA. Their last album is the Phantom Antichrist from 2012  showing a band in great form.  Facebook: Kreator Official,13
We wish you all a merry Christmas. Thank you all so much for being a part of Roskilde Festival and making it the best 8 days of the year! We can't wait to do it all over again next year!,6
HAPPY NEW YEAR from Los Angeles! Looking forward to seeing you all again in 2016! My 10th anniversary of going to Roskilde Let me know if anyone is going to be in Los Angeles before then or is coming to New Orleans for Mardi Gras/Faschings Dioenstag! We can party before the big party! Enjoy and Happy New Year!,0
Foo Fighters this year ???,0
A Day to remember  PLEEEEASE!!! :D,0
blood command come to roskilde!!!!!!!!!!,0
No. Get A Tent does not include any regular festival wristband.,0
Sadly  it's true. We'll send out an official statement around noon.,0
How long are the food stalls open? What are the prices on beer? How to get there? Where to store your stuff?  The practical info has been updated: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/ Photo: Andreas Holm,20
How many drakes at the festival?,0
Is there any info on the possibility of using mobilepay? :),0
Are the World Cup not shown on the campsite?:(,0
Can you bring your own Beer intot he festival? Just for the campsite.,0
- Under Drink Sales it states that there's a stall at Agora M. Should be Get a tent East.  - Clear info on Trains running on the 29th from 08.07-15.37 to the Entrance Platform to then be shuttled through C to the queue outside Entrance west. Then they start running again 18.37? - Water is posted twice. Sorry for being so anal. :),0
and the weather...?,0
would it be illegal to try and set up a Beamer to show the soccer. And what is the speed of the wifi?   Listening to Danish radio as roskilde proposes sounds like a bad option if you can't understand the comments,0
I get on a 30 hour flight tomorrow from aus for the amazing festival.... Can't wait!!! Best festival in the world,0
 TRASH It’s getting easier to get rid of your trash! This year every Agora has its own new Trash Station where you can sort and dispose your trash. Between 9:00 – 16:00 Trash Station guards help you sort your trash correctly. Look for the Trash Station symbol.   FINALLY!! :'),0
When will the updated version of appetizer and the RF app be released? :-),0
Yeah  I miss the updated version of appetizer as well! Roskilde Festival:),0
how long before a band goes on do you start/open the line for the pit?,0
Any barbers/hairdressers?,0
So no trains from festival to roskilde after 1600 on sunday 6th july? Is that really correct? So if I want to leave the festval on sunday evening I have to take the bus?,0
We are nine people staying at GAT East. Three of us arriving sunday  the rest monday. How can we make sure that we are staying in tents next to eachother? Should the three of us also bring their vouchers  so that we can reserve their tents? Hope thas possible :),0
Thanks! Cashmere Cat will play Apollo at 19:30 Friday. We'll fix it in the app,0
Great!! then i can watch both seeed and cashmere cat!!,0
Events at Roskilde Festival now has a calender up and running. This will be updated continuously. The calender url is : www.facebook.com/Roskildeevents/app_190322544333196,0
See you soon  Roskilde Festival!,0
See you soon. We can't wait!,0
Tuborg Summer Packages are sold out  yes. We'll update the info as soon as possible,0
So no more beer... Sad.,0
We agree. And we're happy that people address the problem. The more people address the problem the more likely a shift in attitude among the very few who feel differently gets. But we don't believe in tall barbed-wired fences and watch dogs.  And of course there are consequenses of entering the camp site without a wristband: http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/#c4210,0
Do you need a entrance booking if you work as a volunteer? Or is it same procedure as last year?,0
Same procedure as every year  Miss Sophie!,0

Nanna?? :D,0
Hi  I have an apple and a Nokia  is it possible to switch charger type between each charge?,0
We booked two tickets  but did'nt get any entrance like last year(example West or East). Is it one spesific entrance we need to use?,0
no,0
No. You can get in from any entrance as soon as everyone with entrance booking has entered. You can still get entrance bookings though: http://www.billetnet.dk/search/?keyword=Roskilde+Festival+entrance+booking&language=en-us&brand=dk_rf,0
Contact the firm you bought the ticket from. Roskilde dosn't handle the ticket sales.,0
Hi  Since next week will be my first Roskilde festival I would appreciate advice from more experienced people. Any tip is welcome  especially on following things:  -) What is the best way to get there from Copenhagen? -) When should one arrive? (since I am not part of a camp  I just need space for a rather small tent) -) How do you cool beer there? (a fridge is not an option  -)) -) Is there a ATM somewhere or should I bring a lot of cash?  Thank you very much!,0
There are trains from Copenhagen directly to Roskilde. From Roskilde Station there are shuttle buses to Entrance East and West aswell as a special festival train that runs to a train station directly on the camping site.  You should arrive early  if you're planning to camp close to the stages. But one tent  you can fit in somewhere  no matter how late you come.  The beer is cold if you buy it from one of the stalls on the camping site. Otherwise  an old trick is to soak a newspaper and lay it on top of the beers. You could also use a bucketful of cold water which is free at the agoras (just bring a bucket).  There are ATM's. One at each CITYcentre (look at the map) and one or two at the festival site. But most stalls also accept international credit cards as long as it's a VISA or Mastercard or something similar.,0
- By train and taking the festival busses/trains for Roskilde St. - Sunday afternoon if you want the full experience (and have entrance booking) - Generally just drink them faster although keeping them under your tent also works - Yes  there are ATMs. Most stalls accept all major credit and debit cards though so avoid using cash as much as possible,0

Hello favorite festival !  I'll be a volunteer at the Roskilde Festival this year. And I'm looping for a ride to Roskilde (from the Netherlands). Anybody know how to find this? It will be just for me/ 1 person.  See you soon :),0
No I can't my car is too small unfortunately but maybe Bob Den Otter,0
I'm still looking for a seat.. I've sent Bob Den Otter a message but no respons yet. Somebody knows another option to go to Roskilde?,0
Still haven't found anything..,0
When will the rf-app be up & running..? - says  update in june  all the time & as I recall- the festival is about 5 days away...?  ) :),0

Hi guys! I gonna work like volunteer in the Roskilde Festival  but I dont have anything to sleep there and go there every days is too expensive. I am looking for  some volunteer who can share their tent and someone with a extra sleeping bag. Thank you!,0
Hope you find a solution. If not  we offer tent+gear packages with everything you need from DKK 619: http://www.billetnet.dk/event/tent--gear-package-Tickets/381023,0
Second booking of the day. Give it up for:  The Dillinger Escape Plan (US) made its name with complex hard core  which is not only brutal  but also jazz virtuoso-like and filled with surprising genre detours. Their live shows are intense bursts of energy  where the complexities occasionally explode in a ferocity that has made the band's concerts legendary and infamous.,30
We had so much fun at Roskilde 2012. We passed out so many free stickers! People loved the positive message. We will certainly be back this summer in full force. #ILoVELiFE,0
Good morning metal fans. First booking of today:  Anaal Nathrakh (UK) uses elements of black metal  melodic death metal and grind core to blur the boundaries of how uncompromising you can use the heavy music to evoke a dark cloud of terror and death. When Mick Kenney and David Hunt perform on stage  they usually bring in reinforcement  so together they can match the attack of the guitar and growls on the Brits’ albums.  Check back at 11.00 for the next one  -),24

Having trouble finding your way around Roskilde? This Africa themed map will help you!!! Visit our camp in Gongo (G) for the  Malaria party  and  Lion hunt !!  #rf14afrika #rf14,0
Love the map! What's the story behind it?,0
Thanks! It's related to our camps theme  Afrika-Expeditionen . We pretend to be going on a 19th century expedition to Africa  - except it's to Roskilde. The idea behind the map was to fit the festival in the outline of Africa. All the camping areas are given a name by simply adding the ending  -ongo  or  -ngo . So area G becomes  Gongo . The city centers are called the eastern and western colonies and so on. The map will be used for planning our trips around the festival  for a bit of Risk and then in our events  the lion hunt : https://www.facebook.com/events/644572102302882/ and  malaria party : https://www.facebook.com/events/1424848591134128/?context=create&source=49 Can barely wait! :D,0
Can we show off your map in our social channels?,0
Yeah  it would be an honor! :D,0
Coming up tonight!,0
You can not enter without ticket,0
Question!  When is it possible to enter the campsite if you do not have an entrance booking?  Sunday after 18? or first on monday?,0
Sunday after everyone with tickets have entered,0
About 20 or 21 sunday.,0
It shouldn't be more than a couple of hours.,0

And many huge  batteries. It will be at West from Tuesday nigth  near the old spot of Camp Brokeback  (near the bridge  somewhere allong the railroad  north of the bridge). They are joining us bc their system can't make it this year.,0

Would be awesome. I don't see it happening though – RF already have three hard rock / metal headliners booked. With somewhere between seven and nine headliners in total  it would be odd if half of them turned out to be that heavy.,0
I know..... Tool just haven't visited RF since 2006.. :(,0

The last one: In Isolation?,0
Easy: Number one is Three Fat Bellies  2 is Bird Lure Questionmark  3 is Person In Jail and 4 is Merlin Chant From Movie Excalibur. Never heard of any of them  sounds like a hell of a booking. Rihanna  eat your heart out!,0
O.S.I,0
The bottom one is probably The Dillinger Escape Plan  since John Dillinger was imprisoned from 1924 to 1933.,0
Signe: That would be aaaawesome.,0
The Pineapple Thief,0
Søren Steen Nielsen: Nice guess  but no  -),0
Peter Hook and the light playing Joy Division.  Isolation - Joy Division,0
Jonas - google the imprisonment of John Dillinger and you will find out  ),0
The Dillinger Escape Plan sounds like the obvious choice... It's just  the bottom one keeps getting to me. It's a soundclip of Merlin saying Anaal Nathrakh (backwards). Next to it is a wand (it's a magic spell)  and below that  between 20k and 400k likes on FB (Anaal Nathrakh has 22.5k)... It's probably both. The two top one's still comfuse me though...,0
Im guessing at least 3 bands as well.. It's the dashed and solid lines that confuse me.. WHAT TO THEY MEAN!?,0
One of those is Anaal Nathrakh for sure - hence the Merlin chant. They'd confirmed themselves for Copenhell earlier  but the rumour is RF splashed out the cash and hijacked the deal... Not sure how I feel about that  but of course I'd like to see that band wherever they play!  Imprisoned dude: The Dillinger Escape Plan!,0
Emil you've lost me xD,0
@Emil - I think it might be several bands. Or maybe the top two are something else than band names? Perhaps song/album names..,0
Alexander Aleg-One Kolby Easy: There are three bands  and they're all heavy. That's what the topmost picture means. The three dividers below are riddles for each band.  Pelican  Dillinger Escape Plan and Anaal Nathrakh? Sounds about right to me.  EDIT: The top one can't be Pelican. They've got too few likes to reach the 400k barrier.,0
Anders Cold you're so smart <3 :D,0
And Emil as well xD,0
Can't be Pelican.. We're in search of a band with 400.000 likes - and Dillinger only has 200.000 and Anaal have 20.000,0
I just sussed that out too. I'll keep diggin'.,0
@Alexander: We're in search of bands with 20 000 - 400 000 likes  ),0
Someone broke the code - click and watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ,0
Aleksi Pertola exactly :) And if it's Anaal Nathrakh and Dillinger Escape Plan  we still need a band with around 400.000 likes - why else would they write it?,0
Perhaps it's 4 bands? xxxxxx  Pelican  TDEP & Anaal Nathrakh :),0
First one could be Motörhead? =P,0
Could be SABATON with their 400.000.. And they are playing Metaltown in sweden the same weekend  just like Dillinger :) and they have made the number  Birds Of War ,0
Aleksi - yup  but then the solid line wouldnt mean anything :/,0
How about (B)ird (Lur)e? BLUR? (too many likes  I know),0
I isolated the bird picture and could only find out that the picture has been taken in Prague..,0
The fish is called a  Abu Garcia Tormentor 90 Floating ....,0
Tried that also  couldnt find the picture,0
Maybe Birds in Row. Hook based hardcore/punk band from France?,0
too few likes :/,0
And obviously the top just says: 3 heavy ones.,0
So:  Three heavy ones:  Birds in Row  Dillinger Escape Plan  Anaal Nathrakh,0
Johnny - the top one needs to have 400.000 likes on FB,0
Birds in Row has 10.000,0
Where does it say that?,0
bottom of the picture :),0
20k-400k (y),0
I have also found out there's something called a Bird Hook Knife.. Maybe there's something to it?,0
The last one is Kreator! They have previously named themselves Tyrant (the bird is a Ground Tyrant) and Tormentor (the model of the lure is called a Tormentor).. And they have 400.000 likes :),0
Is it three bands?,0
Kreator Official  The Dillinger Escape Plan and Anaal Nathrakh. All fits the teaser :),0
When is the official announcement?,0
could the first one be The Heavy?  61k likes,0
Graveyard - 61k likes - album: lights out. No further reason needed  ),0
Damn  came late to this one.,0
Airbourne ? They play Rock Werchter same weekend as Roskilde and new album out from them this year. And they are awesome LIVE  :),0
I DON'T CARE  I JUST WANT TOOL!,0
Atli - go for Kreator  The Dillinger Escape Plan and Anaal Nathrakh and not Airbourne,0
Then maybe later Airbourne. I want them to Roskilde,0
well done solving this one guys!,0
Not cool stealing Anaal Nathrakh from Copenhell  not cool,0
If that deal sucks for someone  it's Anaal Nathrakh. Sure they might get some more money  but they'll get to play at noon in front of a few hundred people at the most  whilst at Copenhell they might have got at least an early evening set and a 1000+ audience.,0
tick tock..it's eleven a clock..,0
Aleksi Pertola: The band accidently confirmed both gigs and chose to cancel the Copenhell one. Roskilde did not steal or buy them out in any way - they chose it themselves. Stop with the bullshit rumors already..,0
You people are insane. We were pretty sure you wouldn't break this one - but again  you did :-) Creds to Signe Palsøe for being the first one on The Dillinger Escape Plan  Jonas Kjær Ingstrup nailed Anaal Nathrakh and Alexander Aleg-One Kolby showed kick-ass Google skills to get Kreator right. But as always there are some serious hive-mind thing going in these teaser threads  so creds to all. And yes - the top picture was just to signal that it was  three heavy ones  But damn  we have to step up the game next time if you keep getting them right :-),0
Like I said  Arien: the only one the deal sucks for is the band. They will likely noon/early afternoon set as most extreme metal bands at Roskilde do  with much less audience  and with much more obtrusive security guards who seem to think that moshing  crowd-surfing  etc. should be prohibited at a concert. In contrast  at Copenhell  they would likely have had an evening/late-night set on the Hades stage with an enormous  dedicated crowd. So silly choice by them!,0
The last band at Copenhell goes on around midnight... I'd say there's a far better chance  that the band would have played in daylight there. Roskilde seems to put metal bands on in the afternoon or late at night. So I'm guessing pretty much a 50/50 with this one.,0
Hi  Are there still jobs available at Roskilde? Like the need for an Aussie Chinese blogger?  ),0

Hi Roskilde Festival i bought 2 Full festival tickets + free buss/train ride from Malmö to roskilde the 29th of June (you hade a deal during the swedish national day). When i booked the ticket i couldn't chose a Entrence Booking. So my Question is: Did the Entrance Booking come with the ticket i already have or do i need to buy Entrance booking? Becuase the ride is set to be at Roskilde 12:00 at sunday.,0

Dear Roskilde Festival! Will there be a chance to watch the quarter final matches of the world cup on a big screen on Friday 4th and Saturday 5th of July? because that would be really wicked!!!,0
Answer has been NO for a while  and will still be NO today.,0
This will be the first time for many years that they will not be showing any world cup. And the excuses are just lame!,0
@petur  Not true. They didn't show any World cup last year...,0
That's because World Cups are only every second year  ),0
Haha  fail :D,0
And it will be no tomorrow as well,0
https://www.facebook.com/Roskildeevents New page dedicated to events at Roskilde Festival Please like and post events ! Since the festival app does not contain camp events this year  we are trying to make a hub for all events ,0

For many people  Christmas is a time to celebrate. For some  however  there is less reason to rejoice  and these are the people that many charities reach out to. Roskilde Festival has donated 1 150 000 DKK to help ten different organisations with these important efforts during the otherwise festive holidays.   Thank you all for making this possible by your participation in Roskilde Festival 2015.,66
The fact that roskilde is non-profit and does so much for these great causes is inspiring...,0
Some festivals put the profits down the already rich owners' pockets. And then there's Roskilde.,0
Thank you Roskilde Festival for making the world a bit better.,0
Drop more artists!! ??,0

Roskilde Festival check out those listed below. I'm even willing to take the job to book some of them myself  out of my own wallet!

Absolutely! Greetings from Rörtångens Party Group  Sweden :),0
I am willing to donate my kidney  if you get Die Antwoord to play at Roskilde 2013! <3,0
The world's most underestimated and overlooked band is JJ72 - this is Mark Greaney in a recording from 2010 ... Unfortunately  JJ72 disintegrated several years ago.  ,0
http://www.nme.com/news/the-who/68389 Please get The Who to play Roskilde again :) ? The show in 2007 was awesome :),0
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes  Wild Nothing  Foxygen  Magnetic Fields  Teitur  Tallest Man on Earth  Josh Ritter  Local Natives for the smaller acts.  The Strokes  the Pixies  Frank Ocean  the Shins  the Roots  Babyshambles or Pete Doherty  Phoenix for the big names.  If any one of these bands show  big or small. I will buy full tickets  for me and my Danish girlfriend who used to go every year with her friends  and also prompt many of my on-the-fence MBA class to buy them too.  We're free the whole week.,0
Flying Lotus to play at cosmopol obviously,0
We add Danish band SYND OG SKAM to the Roskilde Festival 2013 lineup.  This announcement is on occasion of an award show taking place tonight - the Danish music critics are handing out awards to Danish artists they truly think deserve them.  Synd Og Skam is nominated in no less than three categories – Hope of the year  Band of the year and live act of the year.,12
a-ha?  Just to please me?,0
Consider to offer this at the festival for people who need  luxury .  Afterwards they can be donated to countries that need shelters. ,0
This is how it looks with 32 out of 175 acts announced.  What else are you hoping for in the 2016 line-up?  Tickets available here - get 'em while they're hot: http://roskil.de/rf16buyticket,13
There's quite a few of the bands you mention that are inactive or won't be at Roskilde for other reasons though.,0
Roskilde has a history of making bands reunite or start touring again. Don't give up to soon Anders. You did write this earlier regarding RATM  but check out their homepage - they Are not unfamiliar to give one offs.,0
Who do you know of that Roskilde instigated to reunite? I can't think of anyone. Only Prince springs to mind when pondering which artists Roskilde succesfully have prompted to start touring again  and even that one is a wild guess. I am more inclined to think that his subsequent tour was already secretly lined up in the background.,0
Something's going down soon.  (Danish reference in here),7
We will get new band accouned at Steppeulvene?,0
Im guessing that  Årets Håb  will get announced :),0
Something with  ... First time at Roskilde  But don't get the first part.,0
Almost thought #1 from triple j's hottest 100 (announced around 8.30 local time today) ... aka Macklemore... But it looks like it'll be Steppeulven,0
The statue is the danish  critic's choice  award called  Steppeulven ,0
-which is held tonight at 21,0
At 21:00 on  Årets Steppeulv  they will announce that #1 in the Song Contest (which starts at 20:30) will play on Orange.,0
I think it's Daft Punk.... :D:D,0
A band that has won 9 Steppeulven awards! Malk De Kojin??,0
These guys. http://twentyonehorses.net/,0
Who Made Who,0
i didn't know we were goin to play the Orange stage  my band is called  9 cats  one o'clock   i can't think there is anyone else than us..,0
System of a down  ),0
Taking in the 2013 nominees makes it a lot broader :/ So  the artists that are both nominated for Årets Steppeulv and haven't played Roskilde before are: Synd og Skam Targana Pyjarama Christian Hjelm Jonas Breum  Just note that this wasn't extremely thorough research  if there wasn't a video of their concert at roskilde on the first page of a google search with  [artist name] roskilde festival  I assumed they haven't played there before.   Idunno  I still think MC Einar is more credible.,0
Asbjørn  we appreciate you writing English because we have people from many countries in here.,0
Teddybears? :D,0
Roskilde will have a shit at 21:30. It will look orange. Roskilde got sick  no wonder why.,0
Whilst sitting on the new bio degradable toilet  the famous indian hip hop singer    Sitting bear   did  1 at 20.28 at Roskilde Festival :-),0

This may come as a chock Tupac is dead!,0
http://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/2pac-revived-as-a-hologram-at-coachella-why-i-didnt-like,0
Am I really the only one guessing MC Einar? :/,0
Hey  not that I'll be disappointed when I was the only one who guessed this shit.,0
 9 black panthers - first time at roskilde  WU TANG CLAN!!!! (minus ODB of course),0
Damn. It was Synd & Skam. It wasn't my first guess  but I did call it.   Getting it on the second guess is good enough.,0
Thanks for all the theorizing!  The logo just symbolises the festival - this doesn't mean that Synd Og Skam is playing any specific stage.,0
The date for the Roskilde gig isn't set yet. It could theoretically be any day from Thursday to Sunday during the festival. But since she is in Germany Wednesday and her gig in Poland Sunday after the Open'er festival looks legit  she will most likely perform at Roskilde Friday the 5th or Saturday the 6th of July.  Pure speculation on my behalf – nothing official.,0
If i get 1000 likes i will jump on stage and have sex with Joey Badass on stage .,0
Oh dear. What is it with you Norwegians? Last time it was 1M likes and some young lady would get down and dirty.,0
Can you please book Stone Roses? It is a life long dream for me to see them live. Thank you.,0
Northside Festival had them last year. Can't think of a more disappointing concert experience in years. They were unbelievably bad  or rather  the band played well  but Ian Brown was even more tuneless than his reputation.,0
I have also hear from my friend who saw Stone Roses and she says before the show i was fan but not anymore because the show was so bad,0
I once went to an Ian Brown concert and he was totally awesome!,0
Pétur: How long was it ago? I am curious as to where and when he lost the plot. If your Danish is good enough  I wrote an honest review of their gig at Northside right here: http://www.soundvenue.com/live-anmeldelser/2012/06/17/the-stone-roses--paa-udflugt-fra-alderdomshjemmet,0
It was in the year 2000. I will have a lokk at your piece.,0
I heard also last year Stone Roses got many bad reviews from the shows,0
Michael Christian Petersen had a premonition about Tenacious D way back in 2013.,0

A group of Syria's most talented musicians have been reunited for the first time in five years. Over the last couple of weeks  they played a number of concerts in Denmark as part of the Syrian Culture Caravan. We are proud to support this project.  If you didn't catch any of the shows  you can check out this ensemble who made a surprise stop in the middle of Copenhagen's Central Station.,186

Good signings so far RF. If You keep up this pace You will reach the all time high program of 2005. You still need to sign - Cage The Elephant  Savages  The Duke Spirit  Rage Against The Machine - or make Audioslave reunite :-),0
I think RATM is just as much a case of a reunion as Audioslave would be. They haven't done anything as a band in five years.,0
There you are again Anders Cold ?? ... Unfortunately you are right. Just being hopeful....,0
But Anders - the Duke spirit have just started giving concerts again and they will release a new album soon,0
If you're attending Roskilde 2014  bring your old voucher as well as some ID to either CITY centre East or West - and you can get this year's offer.,0
Maby you should announce this a litte better. It's a good solution  so spread the news wide...,0
Dear Roskilde Festival.  On the festival map available on the homepage  it looks like the  Clean Out Loud  area is limited to three blocks in the E area. Does this mean that normal festivals attendees  like my self  can camp in the remaining E area without violating the sovereignty of the  Clean Out Loud  organisation?  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3148995/map%202014.pdf  Best regards  Niels,0
All of E should be relegated to COL  as far as I know.,0
Clean out loud is the whole E section. http://cleanoutloud.blogspot.dk/p/om-clean-out-loud_13.html,0
Yeah  I have read the information at COL's blog as well and I am expecting the the whole E area is to be COL territory. However I have not received this information directly from the festival it self and according to the map  it looks like this might not be the case.,0
All of the E area is dedicated to the Clean Out Loud project.,0
How do you figure that?,0

Screw the chilipeppers. They had their chances here. Paid many times  and been disappointed by their cheap shows (only played 45 min 2 times! For the price of a full concert. And cancelled another). But PJ Harvey is a scoop  really looking forward to that. And Tenacious D could be a fun sideshow  with some goodwill and humor.,0

You guys should bring El Efecto from South America. I'll keep posting these guys work until someone from the curators check out!  They're independent and put on social issues to make their lyrics. A festival with this kind of approach will definetely enjoy their songs! As a Brasilian  i highly recommend them if you liked Emicida (RF2014)  the guys from Metá Metá and OQuadro this year. Worth checking and spreading.  Make sure the english subtitles are turned on! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShH6ux49ac,0

Roskilde Festival I have a question about Get A Tent. When you arrive  you pick the tent you want. But how do you know the tent isn't taken? I arrive quite early thursday  do I really have to go stick my head in the door at every tent to check if it's available  and risk waking people up in the tents who are taken? If that is so  that will be quite a hassle  and anoying for the people sleeping in their tent.  If its like that  I have a suggestion  that still can be done in time  and is an easy sollution to this: Print out alot of red stickers  enough for every tent in the Get A Tent-area. When people come with their wouchers to pick their tent  give them a red sticker and tell them to put it on the door of the tent they choose. That way  people can easily see which tents are occupied  and which tens are available! :)  By the way  will there be toilets and/or showers at Get A Tent East?,0
You will be guided to a tent.. Yes there are toilets/showers at GaT,0
The are numbered. You get your own number. Much like a hotel room ,0
Do your homework. Drake instead of Drake.,0
What do you mean 'instead of'? Drake is playing.,0
The merchandise prices are the same on site.,0
Is it possible to see a full schedule of the Street City shows anywhere? :),0
Very soon.,0
Really? Its a music festival not a sporting event. Wifi is free. Bring something to watch the games on if its that important to you.,0
check these guys out.  unsigned. FUN!!!!!  ,0
I find it horrible that Roskilde is not showing the World cup games this year. That you use it as en excuse that the scandinavian countries did not qualify is kinda redundant since they all suck at football and Roskilde implies that it is a international festival for people from all nationalities  and also stating that the 16 team and quarter finals are not important games aswell. Big :( . I hope the festival will reconsider this since there are always alot of people that watch the games during the festival  hence the last decade or so when i have had the privilege of seeing a few games at the festival along hundreds or thousands of people and enjoyed it very much to see the EM or VM games there due to the extremely nice multicultural atmosphere. I hope you reconsider this decision and will show the games.,0
---------- THE OFFICIAL MILEY CYRUS AFTER PARTY ----------  2 000 free drinks 10 000 liters of snow All the great afterski music Secret DJ act and much much more..  https://www.facebook.com/events/757403557623305/?fref=ts,0
The very best thing you can do is follow E20 and take exit 31 (near Solrød Strand) and then go by road no. 6 towards Roskilde. That will give you the least traffic trouble.,0
Please contact Billetnet about this matter. http://www.billetnet.dk/help/kundeservice/?l=en-us&tm_link=tm_i_2&language=en-us,0
The brand-new band Cancer is one of the most promising Danish acts around. Nikolaj Vonsild - also lead singer of When Saints Go Machine and one of the two members in the band - is particularly keen to see Outkast this year:   “The album “southerneplayalisticcadillacmusic” was one of the first albums I bought myself for my pocket money – and before that I’d been to the record store just to listen to it for two weeks in a row. At that time the southern states  where they’re from  wasn’t something you heard about. It seems a little ridiculous now  but – no kidding – I think that I owned everything they ever released at that point. I’ve never seen them live before  so I can’t wait.   Listen to Outkast and Cancer’s other favourites from the #rf14 line-up:  http://po.st/RF14Cancer,4
> named my band cancer > got cancer,0
 Pocket money ... why not allowance? :),0
Like Fredrik said  a one-day ticket is valid from 5:00 (in the morning) until 5:00 (in the morning  the following day). In this period you can collect your wristband.,0
Okaj  thank you guys for the answer =),0
Please book AC / DC to Roskilde Festival :),0
Ok now we will not Queen and Adam Lambert. Get ACDC instead then. We need some rock legends but stíll Queen i was hoping for to play Roskilde,0
Thx for booking Ho99o9 ! Just watch them tonight and can´t wait to see them again and go crazy - a few words about it: ,0
Come on give us Queen+Adam Lambert!,0
Here is some Orange Feeling ! :D,0
Did someone forget to push a button? You don't have the  make your own concert schedule  thing you usually have on the website this year?,0
The function is in the app...,0
We suggest using the app instead.,0
What app? For smart phones? I only have a stupid phone.,0
Please book Queen and Adam Lambert to Roskilde Festival :),0
Does it look familiar to the opening of the camp-site?.....same same  but much different!:) ,0
I can't believe you're not gonna screen the world cup. And I thought you guys were cool. Hugely disapointed with what has always been my favorite festival.,0
I can't believe you're not gonna screen the world cup. And I thought you guys were cool. Hugely disapointed with what has always been my favorite festival.,0
Please don't invite crap acts like  Die Antwoord  from my home  it's embarrassing! There are so many great artists in South Africa like: Arno Carstens and Freshly Ground  no need to scrape the bottom of the barell!,0
Working as a volunteer for Roskilde Festival you sometimes  get around . Here's a small flick about five festival geeks taking over Germany (or at least part of Germany).  Do you also want to volunteer for Roskilde Festival? Right now there are some interesting openings. Go here to check it out -> http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/volunteer/,6
I can't see the interesting openings..only that one should send an application  but no specific jobs? :),0
Faye Levy get on this kiddo x,0
@Elise: Whereever you are from in the world  you can always send an application through job@roskilde-festival.dk and we will try to match you up. Right now most of the openings we have needs you to be living in Denmark (since they require meetups before the festival). Annette (above) got the link,0
amazing he went to the festival 2007 and he wanna go back :-) Orange feeling all the way!!!,0
Doesn't get any better than this!  :-),0
Ond line up  mangler kun Metal http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/01/primavera-sound-2013-lineup-revealed-blur-my-bloody-valentine-and-wu-tang/,0
Do you know when Red Hot Chilli Peppers are playing so i can book flight tickets thankyou,0
You will find out in 2016  maybe in April  maybe first in June. If you are lucky  RHCP might announce the date on their own website before that.,0
Info coming up soon,0
I have heard you won't show any matches from the World Championship. That is clearly a mistake. Normally loads of people watch the games at Roskilde Festival. How are we going to survive? Please. Show the matches,0
I'm pretty sure you will survive!,0
Not gonna happen. Bring a smartphone there is free wifi.,0

You dont need it that late. You only need entrance booking for the first 2 hours or so on sunday.,0
Martin is right. With your volunteer wristband you can choose any entrance and enter on the same conditions as those with Entrance Booking. Read more at http://roskilde-festival.dk/practical/entrance_booking/entrance_booking_faq/#2ukHJ05Swcr6mA9r.99,0
get bassnectar and red hot chilli peppers please =) much love from america ,0
The Black Angels! Seriously  you NEED to book them asap! New album out in April  US tour april-may.  TheBlackAngels.com Austin TX's greatest band since The 13th Floor Elevators. ,0
We announce Baby In Vain  Mother Lewinsky and Overthrow today.  All three acts will play our Pavilion Junior stage for upcoming acts.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/first-junior-acts-are-ready/,12
The Waiting Areas will open Saturday 28 June at 16.00. We'll put that info in or FAQ as well,0
???????? - that's how you spell Roskilde in Russian.  Come meet two formerly imprisoned members of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot at Roskilde.  See updated schedule: http://po.st/RF14schedule Read more: http://po.st/RF14PussyRiot,115
no concert?,0
Actually..isn't it: ???????? ?,0
If only Warpaint wasn't playing at that exact time...,0
Michael Søberg :D,0
Martina Fraternali... see who is there as well. XD sooo much  women-power ,0
Hey Roskilde  it says Friday the 5th on your homepage. I guess you mean Friday the 4th? You might wanna clarify that :) Great event!,0
omg are they going to play at Roskilde?,0
put-out,0
you know nothing Jon Snow,0
Irene Pedraza  you tell us. We plucked it from Wkipedia (which isn't always bullet-proof correct  we know).,0
Thomas Rysgaard Jensen  no concert. These two women aren't a part of Pussy Riot any longer.,0
exactly  now it says: Roskille in russian,0
It is pronounced  Roskille   not  Roskilde   so I guess the  WP transliteration is correct.,0
Sorush Sakaya  Drake isn't being replaced by anyone. He is playing. you must have seen an old news article from 2010 when he cancelled his Roskilde gig.,0
Usually when you transliterate to Russian  you type it like it sounds  in this case ????????. Just like know-how becomes ???-???.,0
Really? Damn I want to see both...,0
Warpaint at 17:00  and these ladies at 17:30 - so you might be able to catch the end of the speech,0
Joakim Berg Villumsen  thanks  we'll fix it. It's Friday no matter what :-),0
cool!! i really appreciate them in some way!!  ),0
It depends on whether you spell it based on the written or spoken Danish. The problem with translation is that Russians pronounce things as they are written  whereas Danish spoken language is divorced with what it looks when written.,0
Daniel Brink  they're not playing. They're giving a speech. These two women are not a part of Pussy Riot anymore.,0
What is the price for at 13 year old? Can we buy entrance wednesday and then come back sunday on the same ticket? And is it still free for kids under 10? Don't know where else to ask?!,0
Where can I buy a children's ticket - I cannot find it on Billetnet? Children's tickets can only be purchased at the entrances and cannot be sold out. Children under 10 years get in for free but must be accompanied by an adult (over 18 years old). Remember to bring valid ID. Children's tickets are sold to children between 10 and 14 years old. Children must be accompanied by an adult (over 18 years old). Remember to bring valid ID.   From Billetnet's FAQ. Doesn't state the price though. As long as you get the wristband on wednesday  that's your  ticket  for the rest of the week. For one day tickets you won't get access before sunday morning at 5.00 if that's what you're asking.,0
Thank you already Roskilde spirit??,0
The return of the Pet shop boys? Oh yes please! ,0
They will not do 2 shows in Denmark because they are playing in Copenhagen on June 9. Sorry my friend but big bands do not play 2 shows in Denmark. Denmark is to small,0
http://www.sting.com/tour/index/ Bring him please! lots of space in his schedule.,0
You have what  12% of the programme and you already bitch and moan about it?,0
Loads of rock in the programme already. Don't expect RATM. They aren't touring.,0
Anders - QOTS have been there 2 or 3 times before,0
Honestly  all this music talk  I thought you just went for the booze!,0
One doesn't leave out the other - or :-),0
Nope. You can burn down hundreds of tents in a matter of few minutes. We have a cooking area where you can use it,0
Miss you to Mikkel  ),0
how did that happen?,0
I love the picture,0
It was a photo we received from an Australian who had been at Roskilde. We posted it because it said 'Western Australia' next to your post  so we thought we'd bring a little kangaroo flavour in here as well.,0
thank you :) I live atm in Western Australia so it make good sense for me  I see small joeys all the time,0
Alice in chains was there 2 years ago i doubt that they will come again,0
hopefully they will :),0
We aim at announcing new acts on a steady basis - but we can't promise anything. It depends on the contractual work.,0
Tune into Roskilde this fine sunday! Concerts from 17.15 and all night long: http://www.dr.dk/TV/live/dr-k Photo: Jacob Dinesen,13
Guess Im staying up till 00:15 then \m/,0
would be even more awesome if it worked  ),0
Is it also on the Telly?,0
Guess its only for danish citizens? I cant get a picture in Sweden. I just get a dark screen with a spinning circle,0
It should work outside Denmark  or so I'm told. Try this: http://www.dr.dk/tv/program/dr-k-roskilde,0
Thank you. That works nicely :),0
It's also on the telly yes. But if you don't have the channel you can see it on DR's website (follow link). That is supposed to work from eveywhere (not only in DK) - the concerts don't start until about an hour.,0
Yes  try this: http://www.dr.dk/tv/program/dr-k-roskilde,0
Also lots of concerts at our own channel: http://roskilde-festival.dk/tv/,0
Please book Blur to Roskilde :),0

Julie giver drinks næste år :D,0
Hi Roskilde Festival  i come here for two things: One  to thank you guys and the crew of CampAid 2015 for the amazing thing in my life: being a volunteer and help out the world WHILE enjoying this amazing festival. It was overwhelmingly intense to walk around campsites  crash in parties and meetup with people chilling to remind them to take care of their barracks and bring back next year or consider the donation towards refugee camps  nepal earthquake victims  and homeless people in Scandinavia. All this while listening to Disclosure  Run the Jewels  TropKillaz  Die Antwoord and many more.  This inspired me so much  so much  but SO MUCH that while watching  through internet reports and social media articles these Enviromental Disaster here  as we speak  all the way down in brasil  leaving 700km of toxic sludge in a delicate enviroment that has flowed to the Atlantic Ocean  me and some underground (and mainstream) names of Rio de Janeiro are giving birth to a small  free  open-air social cause to raise drinking water and food to be sent to the native and small cities that were absurdly destroyed.  I have never managed an event  but i've been around the scene for long time  leaving the structural and sound/place/legislation for it to happen to friends that worked all over the night musical scene of rio  and all in all i have couple funtional arms and legs  eyes and mouth to pay attention on the world that surround us  and i was in need to put together GOOD MUSIC and a social cause. You guys kickstarted the fire that now burns inside of those who helped the world to be a little little little bit more kind. I would like some tips on how to reach out for mixing social struggle with a music festival  and i though of no one better than you guys to help me out on those little knowhow things. maybe there are aspects that my unprofessional view of things can't see and might be ahead on the making of this small musical gathering here in Rio.   Here are some good musicians that we might have around to play  and if you pay attention  they might have something really important to say:,0
** forgot to tell that the video from El Efecto attached has english subtitles.,0
Another band with social critics that might play is Overdrive Saravá   And this song  even though has no english subtitles  sings about a case where a homeless native indigenous was set fire  and the accused people said  It was nothing but a joke.   One of the four young men who set him on fire is now a civil policeman.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQPzQf6pzqs,0
I really hope you tried or booked Queen+Adam Lambert for 2016!,0
I hope that also :),0
Dear Roskilde Festival  all I want for Christmas is: // BECK // BLUR // BEIRUT // MODERAT // BEACH HOUSE // BEST COAST // PURITY RING // POND // DIIV // LOWER DENS // SAVAGES // THE RADIO DEPT. //,0
Beach house and beck are playing at northside so that wont happen unfortunately,0
Bummer... their line up so far looks pretty good.,0
Roskilde Festival Hello! I have a question: is it true that Rihanna will perform in Roskilde between 4th-7th of July - every day?,0
No  that's not quite true. She plays at the festival BETWEEN 4-7 July. We release our schedule sometime in June.,0
Ok  so between 4-7th of July she is going to play for ex. 1 or 2 concerts but not 4 concerts  right? I ask you about it  because there are rumours that she will visit my country at Diamonds World Tour in July (precisely 7th of July).,0
One concert is lined up.,0
Ok  thanks for a reply :) Have a nice day!,0
Yeah cause that's gonna happen :),0
I gotz allz the metulz I needz withz xXSlipknotzXx xoxo <3 <3 :*,0

To ting: 1. Get a room  you freeeaks :) 2. Æ-æ-æ-æ,0
It's no problem bringing that one. Just remember to take it home with you or throw it out after the festival.,0
We've brought one exactly like that for a couple of years. They're great  and they'll easily last more than one festival  so tuck it away safely in your basement afterwards. Will come in handy next year.,0
Might be open for anyone at that time.,0
Everyone  with and without booking will be in at that time.,0
So  what's so special about Roskilde?,56
Do you have the exact area for Rockwool shelters ?? Not on the map yet. Arriving on the monday  so can I park in the free parking area before I walk Down and get my armband?,0

Peter: Actually they have three other tickets coming their way. Short version of a long story: In the fall the festival were at SPIEL in Germany (worlds largest boardgaming convention) and for a short period had a crazy offer on tickets:  If you find our booth and buy 3 tickets  we will send you 3 more tickets ! So two of the people from the camp drove from Holland  found us and claimed the offer :-),0
Katrine: Considering that Australia is on the other side of the planet  we do have quite a few Australien campers,0
Boardgaming convention? Bet these guys are a laugh,0

Hello good old Roskilde! Quick (and possible silly) question here: does the one-day-tickets include a stay on the camp during the warm-up (and the camp in general during the actual festival)?,0
One-day tickets are as the name suggests valid for only 24hrs the day it's for. Of course you can stay at the camping for those 24hrs  but not before or after.,0
You get access on the day from 0500 in the morning to 0500 the next morning,0
Alright  thank you both:),0
What is your camp called?  If you're feeling competitive  remember to sign up for Camp of The Year. More info: http://po.st/RF14COTY,42

Dear Roskilde festival  Ive been at Roskilde festival for 3 years now  and it have been some of the best weeks of my life :)  One of the things that i remember best from Roskilde is that  you manage to create a universe  where you have everything you need.  And now i just wondered if thoose guys who sell coffee from backpacks is coming again this year. I think they are called coffee cow. If they arent coming there will definitely be somthing great missing. It´s so cool that i could just stick my head out of the tent and get awsome coffee.,0
Need a ride from Skien/Porsgrunn/Langesund to Roskilde Festival? Send PM  Info:  ,0
Our brand new app is now ready! Download here: http://splt.cc/roskilde-festival (Still a few features missing  so look out for an update very soon).,39
Remember to remove The Old,0
Great! Some fine features  but seriously  remove the Recommendations feature if you cannot do any better...,0
Could be useful Andrew Sutcliffe,0
Why isnt all the artists in the chedule in the app? Dengue dengue dengue is missing,0
Recommandations not working,0
So this new app of yours really miss that old schedule view from the other app. It was the best way to see what's playing where and when. This new one really needs that right/left scrolling overview.,0
Great news  but the Windows Phone app isn't updated in the store and the one available from 2013 won't work on WP 8.1,0
Hey Roskilde Festival  a better integration with Spotify would be great. why doesn't the app recognize the my  Likes  from Spotify and markes them in the schedule/calender.  And speaking of Spotify  the festival app is linking to the old Spotify App on Android.,0
Isabelle Viegas we need again !,0
I know it's good  -) Just wondering why you removed it from the app. It was up friday.,0
When will you release the activity schedule?,0
As in Yeeeeaaah!. Thanks  the scedule is up and yes  it's great! :-),0
Are you showing the World Cup matches at Roskilde? Would be great!,0
Caravan tickets are all gone  yes.,0
I offer you my bike for a Travis Scott and/or Denzel Curry performance. (its a brand new bike),0
When will the various playing dates be released? I.e.  red hot chili peppers:),0
Hey! Love the festival and everything about it. My question for you is: Will you do any changes to the main camping area to make it bigger this year? Last couple of years  me and my camp have had a lot of troubble finding a spot for us together. It often ends that we live seperate from each other and far apart.  This year the get a place already sold out...  We will still come and visit the festival  even if you don´t make any changes to the camping =),0
Hei will there be more get a place tickets on offer? Or will there be a system like last year  where we buy 10 tickets and get an area?,0
Wow  our accomodation offers are really popular! Some of them sold out on the first day  and it looks like more will do the same pretty soon. So act fast if you're interested in staying in a Rockwool Shelter  a Tenthouse etc.  Read more: http://roskil.de/camping2016 Buy now: http://roskil.de/rf16ticket  A waiting list is open for sold out products. Just click the desired product under our 'ticket' page and click 'view other dates'.  UPDATE: Rockwoll Shelter is sold out too!  Photo: Khanh Gia,23
Can you be more specific?,0
Shower  toilet.. m.m,0
Got 'em! They're just missing on the map. We'll get it updated.,0
No World Cup this year. You have to bring equipment to watch it on your own. Radio or smartphone. Wifi is free this year.,0
TICKETS TO ROSKILDE FESTIVAL 2016 AVAILABLE NOW  We also offer a wide range of popular camping solutions  gift cards and more.  Buy now: http://roskil.de/rf16ticket Read more: http://roskil.de/camping2016  Photo: Jacques Holst,103
125.22 kr- charge for using a non danish credit card? That's a lot of money and a huge increase from last year!,0
So why the increase in ticket price? Increasing expenses for bands?,0
Will you also provide Daytickets for the first Weekend?,0
When is the specific day for RHCP to perform? Just want to get a one day ticket for them  thanks!,0
1. why is get a place placed so crappy this year?  2. why can't we buy 10 tickets like last year? it was a succes why change it?,0
And please book Queen and Adam Lambert :),0
Cindy Hansen :-D,0
If we I buy a ticket for saturday now  and it turns out RHCP is playing friday  is the ticket valid on friday?,0
Christina Rømer Reenmers Rebecka Bylander Jeanette M Klamer ? ??,0
Your shout this year?,0
same,0
Well  THAT and general rate of inflation. But it'll be worth every penny.,0
I am sure it is! Buying tickets for 12th time in a row (Y),0
I actually don't mind the ticket increase. It's the same every year. But charging me an extra 85 krones for using a non danish card is ridiculous. Over 200% more than last year. I know it's not Roskilde's fault but someone should get Pearl Jam on the phone because Ticketmaster are taking the piss  again!,0
Sorry  no - only for the main music days (Wednesday to Saturday),0
It's been like that forever and ever...the only country in the EU that can do so because of their EU treaty  rebellion  of yore (1992?) they're so proud of. I've been to that festival 22 times 1983-2005 (not in 1994  when I was following the World Cup in football - what the American heathens call  soccer  - in the US  and not in 10 years)  but DanCard has much longer than that (I live an hour from Denmark...) been the preferred card  which should be against the rules (but then again  the British are driving on the wrong side of the road  and nobody's protesting...).  But the Danes don't abide rules - and are proud to tell you why  while puffing on a fat cigar under a 'Non smoking'-sign...that's why we're gonna whip some Danish ass tonight in this year's final chance (for both of us) to qualify for next year's European Cup in football in - France...,0
I'm not talking about the inclusion of the fee. I'm talking about the increase of over 200% since last year,0
We won't be able to tell you this until later in the season.,0
Steen Thomsen please get in touch with Billetnet about this. They've agreed to look into it.  http://www.billetnet.dk/help/kontakt.html?tm_link=tm_i_2&language=en-us,0
Cheers  Roskilde. I'm away in the states so it'll have to wait until I get home.,0
Gg no re,0
when is that???,0
No.,0
Same,0
Jörg Ausfelt  HEY! We aren't all dicks :(,0
!!! let's wait for the next line up announcement,0
Will they sell out tho?,0
noo not yet,0
1. Crappy? That depends on who you are. If you prefer a more central location  you're free to do so but it's not possible to pre-book. 2. We're trying something different this year,0
If I had the money  Bean ??,0
That might be something for us :),0
Done! I'll get you a ticket you just have to spend 40 hours at a train station,0
Will there be flæskesteg?,0

Silent and Violent all the way.,0
Hey Roskilde! Last year I remember a small road going just north of the grusgrav  connecting L and the new camping area at Apollo. Is that road gonna be open when the hegn falls? Wondering if it would be able to take that road and get to G faster than maybe going around the grusgrav :),0
Get a tent EAST!,0
GaT central. This old fart needs a bit of peace and quiet  ) 4 days is enough for me.,0

Will there be toilets and showers at Get A Tent East?,0
Well you bastards took away E... 7 years in E is now impossiple. Thanks alot,0
At the volunteer camp :-),0

I can't see  Entrance South?  Am i looking the wrong places?,0
My rent costs almost the same as a festival ticket  so - home.,0
I have a question! Since i've just stopped at Testrup folkehøjskole i would very much like to bring a piano  but since i know i can't bring any furniture i intend to put some serious wheels beneath it  so it becomes a piano wagon instead of a boom blaster thing. Well how about it? are we turned away at the gate ?,0
I was wondering where Entrance south is? Thank you in advance,0
MC Camp of course :-) But where is it on the map?!,0
Everyone  the map is updated. The link is the same.,0
Hello dear Roskilde Festival.. Is all of E-area reserved for Clean Out Loud? Just wondering because it's quite big compared to the similar project  Green Boot Camp  in 2010 as far as I remember.. But on the other hand  the marking of COL is the same as for Silent & Clean.. I get confused..,0

Hi Roskilde! So Bon Iver just announced a tour through Asia in spring. How about you convince to come to RF16?? I'm sure a lot of people would be more than happy to see him on the poster. I still smile occasionally thinking back to his concert in 2012. Thanks heaps!,0
Hi Roskilde Festival. So  Get A Place sold out REALLY quickly this year. Our camp is very interested in getting a place still - last year we had the pleasure of GAP N  which was perfect  since our camp is minimum 20 persons each year. Is there any chance  that there will be added more Get A Place-tickets this year?,0
Bon jovi for Roskilde now!,0
Either participate in this project  http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/participate-in-dream-city-2013/ Or just queue really  really early and aim for a spot not in the closest vicinity of the stages.,0

#Roskildefestival won ARTISTS' FAVORITE FESTIVAL at European Festival Awards last week - why? Answer is simple: Best audience in the world! #win #ftw @festival_awards #FestivalAwards @ESNSnl,40
AWESOME! My favorite festival too  ),0
An all destroyed by the latest artist. Congratulations.,0
The Bots?,0
The best audience deserves the best bands. This does NOT include Rihanna.,0
gratulerer :-D vel fortjent!,0
A bit harsh on King Krule  The Bots and Angel Haze  Oliver.,0
Some people just enjoy focusing on the negative sides rather than all the goddam positive.,0
Don't care about Rihanna. But why Den Sorte Skole is not book'd is beond me. New album out by then! And i kinda think you owe them  after that crazy 40 aniversary party the gave you!!!,0
Because concerts often become magical at Roskilde is why you get this award. And because you got magic Rihanna is going to be fucking awesome. Excellent and surprising choice my friends.,0
Oh  and who's to say Rihanna won't enjoy Roskilde? It's after all called  The Artists' Favourite Festival .,0
Im so looking forward to My 10 Th time this summer.  by train  public transportation    i have been in bus Camp   Get a tent  caravan  west and east and last year clean and slitent and i have sailed from norway to the festival 4 times now so how to do something different this year?,0
@Kaptein Anders. Ride a bike to the festival and join the bike camp. This guy got the info Ben Townend,0
Kristian Skjøth Madsen- It's a little too early to exclude them :),0
Want to keep the good audience then get more good stuff for us this year... what about Reptile Youth  Justice  The Glitch Mob or Wolfmother for example... :) ?,0
It makes me happy every time i hear about people talking nice about Roskilde. I really don't have anything to say but well deserved. Roskilde is an amazing place to be  and i wish that one week back every day. I love music  the people  the feeling  and everything else. I don't care if Roskilde booked a great pop artist because it's more than that. with the greatest concerts in my life  i always find something to enjoy and  besides that  there's so much more than the music. That's why you are the greatest festival in the world! I'm not good with words  but this event means everything to me! Thank you for giving me the best experience every year <3,0
TOOL på Orange scene!! best feeling in the world!,0
I don't suffer about Rihanna  I am shocked & angry. I really thought it was a joke in the beginnig. For me: Knock out criteria not to go  but I feel free to write as many times I want about that big Roskilde fail. I was Roskilde fan for 20 years  that's why I am so disappointed. You can't disappoint people who don't care  or those  Hey it is all music  self called open-minded and tolerant beings. I have an opinion. That's all.,0
This complaining about Rihanna is getting old.,0
Stop moaning about rihanna(she looks hot) anyway@ kaptein anders hope to see you again this year!!,0
You won't have read it the last time here  Jerry. :-),0
Oliver  we know that you care and we have heard you and fully respect your opinion. But this thread was originally about us just wanting to say  Yay - look what we've got. And it's all because you are such a wonderfull audience - credits to you too people!'...and not about Rihanna. That's all,0
You are really polite Roskilde Festival :) (y) I'm looking forward to next year! <3,0
Yes sorry for this off topic comment. I will never forget the great years I had with so many lovely people. I have never experienced any other festival with such a good vibe. But I also heard you said no! to some very big artists in the past  who wanted to play. That was cool. I would have expected it in that case too  or especially in that case. That's what caused my disappointment. It's like a betrayal of your ideals  and probably also a lament by myself of getting older.  -),0
Take a chill pill Oliver? Even though Rihanna isn't an artist that were suspected by most to play at the festival  and even though her music might be mainstream  it  still is a great move by Roskilde. Rihanna is just as popular today  as Madonna or Prince were in the 80's  and nobody would be pissed off like this  if they showed up. So perhaps you should look at it from a greater perspective  and see that there probably is a reason why Rihanna's music is so popular  and i'm sure the concert will kick ass. SO  drop the complaining and be excited that this wonderful danish festival won a great an honorable prize :),0
Patrick you are right  but I think the award is for the past years. The difference from other festivals is that Roskilde is not that commercial. People from Roskilde help for free  gained money is donated. That spirit can be felt in the audience  people are nicer  more laid back. Morten: I read it 5 times  but I just don't understand your last sentence. I wish you both a great festival  I am sure you will enjoy it  but I will head out for another one. (Never say never  if the rest of the lineup will be as great as it started  I might change my mind). And now I will make some Instagram pics like Rihanna & Roskilde do.  -),0
If you like Roskilde Festival  you should listen to Roskilde Festivalradio! Follow here: http://www.facebook.com/RoskildeFestivalradio,0
Oliver: I must admit I am not a big Rihanna fan either  but since I am going again this year and for the 9th time in total  I for sure will see/hear that Rihanna concert as well. 2003 was all about Metallica for my part. Since that year: 2006-2012 was all about the experience and that very special orange feeling. All music acts are just pure bonus for my part. Up to two weeks before festival start last year I was thinking: Good for me I do not go for the music as first priority  because I felt the program was beyond bad. However  seeing it from the positive side I began listening to a lot of different bands (thanks spotify roskilde playlist btw.) I soon discovered that there would be alot of good music experiences coming up and that turned out greater that I ever expected it would. Bottom line for me: I could sit in my chair and have fun with all my roskilde frineds and co-volunteer workers 9-10 days in a row at that festival  but since we also have the opportunity to go to a lot of concerts  why not do that aswell. I am done being negative about the bands/artists  but with that being said I understand what you mean. If you end up going to RF anyway I will bet you that enjoying a beer in my company will make your festival experience at least 5% better :-),0
Read what metal blog Veckans Vrål thinks about the heavy acts that Roskilde have released so far. Love  music and solidarity beyond borders  ethnicity and religion is what we need right now and the loving Roskilde Festival is a great example of that!  http://veckansvral.blogspot.se/2015/11/copenhell-och-roskilde-gor-lovande.html,0
Our line-up with 29 out of 175 acts announced. Much more on the way.  Remember that we start the ticket sale on Tuesday.,133

Norwegian music journalist Asbjørn Slettemark visited Roskilde Festival for the first time in 1989. Ever since then he has dreamed of standing on one of the stages of what he calls “the world’s best festival”. This year it’s happening: Asbjørn is presenting all the artists playing the Arena stage.  When you go to the concerts at Arena this year  look for Asbjørn. And in the meantime – listen to his favourite artists from this year’s line-up.,0
I did that last year. After the wedding I yelled  Roskilde er i der  fron orange. No response though.  But lived the dream...,0
Hello! I'm just wondering whether it's possible to push forward Interpol's set just a little bit so that people can get from Arctic Monkeys and still catch all of Interpol's show?,0

Dear Roskilde Festival. On tuesday the special accommodations are released and me and my camp of 25+ people are considering ordering 2 x Get a Place. Does ordering 2 x Get a Place at the same time guarantee us that the 2 x 100m2 squares are next to each other?,0
It's not possible to book specific locations. But if one person shows up early with all bought vouchers  you can get areas next to each other if it's possible,0
I don't want a specific location  but just that the to squares are next to each other. In the same way as I would like two get a tent to be next to each other  if I bought both at the same time. But that is also not possible?,0
Unfortunately it is ONLY possible if you show up early with the vouchers. But if you do that it's almost a guarantee,0
How soon will the tickets and tent spaces be gone?,0
Roskilde Festival How is the map coming along? It's really not that easy planning where to set up camp etc. with only the preliminary map as reference.,0
Will be looking for it tomorrow then! Thanks!,0
With your volunteer wristband you can choose any entrance and enter on the same conditions as those with Entrance Booking.,0
Bring Me The Horizon!!!!!???? Thank you!!!!!!!! ??????????????,0

Today we announce three young acts on the way up. We give you Angel Haze  King Krule and The Bots.,24
sounds better than rihanna.,0
s-s-s-spurgt Sneærten,0
Malte Mikkelsen and Mads Christian Nielsen  let's move on  shall we? Let's focus on today's announcement here. Otherwise make a seperate post if you feel the need to utter negatives.,0
You started it yesterday with negative announcements  ),0
The bots - I caught them last year.  Think Black Keys - 20 years ago.,0
Enough with the Rihanna whining already! If it is such a terrible bother to you guys  then just don't buy the ticket.,0
Ok so only happy-joy-joy posts? Your level of arrogance is just mindnumbing  RF. Besides - 2 min of research and hur clear that these acts blow as much as yesterdays.,0
Come on  its 1 act out of 200  its not like your guys are planing to see them all.,0
I haven't slept all night because I was to curious about the announcement x) ..turns out I didn't know any of the bands today  but I don't care -I bet they're great! One of the things I like most about roskilde is to discover new bands to like :),0
uuuh even Roskilde know they made a bad decission with Rihanna  when they ask their audience to shut up about it..,0
Fun fact: King Krule actually made a brilliant rework of Angel Haze's  New York  (soundclip below article) -> http://echoesofmine.com/2012/10/31/angel-haze-new-york-king-krule-rework/,0
Great bookings both today and yesterday!,0
That sounds great! Yeah!,0
please add The Exploding Boy (Official) to the line up!!!!!!,0
In my experience of Roskilde Festival ( 18 festivals since '86) The Line up is often well thought out. Through the years  There have been great names that have dissapointed Us tremendously  just as almost unheatrd of bands have blown Us away! The festival is all about the feeling! So stop bitchin and look forward to another nine days of fun! Peace Out!,0
King Krule (Y),0
These bookings are fine  guys... just.. shut up already.  BTW Roskilde  looking forward to some metal bookings soon.,0
Alan Hinshalwood: love your attitude! It is very much like My own :) Last year I was very dissapointed over the music program  but I was blown away over all the new artists and bands I discovered! That orange feeling - Grannylove :),0
Me Willy Willy want to sea damian marley with N to da A to da S ....yes yeees,0
omg.. wheres britney  pink and gaga!? so dissapointed!,0
First listen to the bots sounds awsome!,0
King Krule and Angel Haze!! yes!!!,0
Looking forward to experience these three unknown artists  first listen sounds very interesting.,0
Great  as always. ,0
I will not come to RF if they come.... Not. The Bots sounds quite good  so I think I will see them. I might consider Angel Haze.,0
Still with the bitterness  eh? You should really focus on all the other acts. In the end  we'll have 200 of them - and we're sure that there'll be something for you.,0
Just a fair question. And i'm also wondering how much of the budget this  Pop fest  will take.,0
Who knows  maybe Queens of the Stone Age were expensive. Maybe we got rihanna at a fair price. We'll keep those details to ourselves - and either way  it's something we've chosen to book. We'll book 199 other acts  knowing that everything's not for everyone. Simple fact. Let's move on  shall we?,0
Who knows? You know  but you won't tell us. But yeah  i'll move on. To North Side maybe =) But seriously  i Love RF.  But by booking this soulless  mass produced teenage autotune money machine as a headliner  it seems you are going in a totally wrong direction. And it disapoints me. Yeah  i know there will b199 more artists/bands  and many of them i guess will be great. It's just that  this choice you have done makes me sad. Anyway  enjoy your teenfest.,0
BTW  i despise Slipknot as well  ),0
Fair enough. Still  we are CERTAIN that we'll have loads of good stuff in the lineup for you.,0
he he,0
It's the eleventh day in the eleventh month of the year. At 11:11 we'll bring you 11... no wait  18 new acts.,17
Tenacious D!,0
More Reggae would be irie!,0
A,0
Please give us Queen and Adam Lambert. It would be best birthday gift ever :),0

Am tuned in...,0
Søren Andersen!  D,0
Hey Roskilde looking forward to see you again. About a month or so ago I made 5 suggestions as to which acts should  to play in 2016'. Now I'm  kinda hoping that you guys could throw me a hint as to what some of my fellow Festivalgoers might have to say in the matter and to be honest i kind forget what i suggested so i was hoping that you might be able to shine some light on what everybody would like to hear next summer.  Orange greetings,0
Very soon.,0
Are you showing the world cup?,0
http://gaffa.dk/nyhed/68181 Let s get David Bowie to Roskilde this summer :),0
Might be that i'm old  might be that I don't follow the trends... but 17 out of 20 announced bands have no tie to Rock. I might be part of a dying race  but if so I'll be damned if I don't do anything to make a point.  I was thrilled to see you release QoaSA and Slipknot - but i guess mainstream moneymaking has taken its toll on Roskilde aswell. I can cope with that as long as you keep those one of a kind rock'n'roll bands rolling in.  Does anyone follow me?,0
Remember  Morten  in the end we'll have 200 acts   and there will be lots of rock music.  But 17 out of 20 is stretching it a little  isn't it?,0
Mads Frederiksen  first let's get one thing straight about Rihanna. She does not use playback. She sings and has a really nice voice and a great energy. Plus she brings a great playing band. Don't trust us  have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W-poRSA9do  Secondly  this is not the first time (far from it!) that we've booked a major pop artist. We book music in all kinds of genres - always have. We know that everything isn't for everyone  but in the end we'll have 200 acts and the lineup will be just as diverse as ever  and we're sure that you'll find gold in there as well.,0
@ Roskilde Festival: Thanks for your reply! My comment was not made to start an argument whether she uses playback or not  neither as an attack on pop-artists in general. I was just expressing my concerns about the current indications  that one of the best festivals in Europe is starting to crumble underneath the heavy pressure of the modern music-industry  where sex(ism?) is used as a tool to become popular. A  concert  like Rihanna's can hardly even be called a music-show  its more of a  live-strip-show-with-a-catchy-beat . I mean  just look at the thumbnail on your own link above  and then say to yourself  she is not taking advantage of her good looks . I dare you.,0
shut up and drive!!,0
Duuude  treo? come on..,0
Bet you a beer that you're wrong? We predict a fully crowded audience area in front of Orange Stage when she plays,0
People  remember we have 8 stages  which means that you have 7 other stages to visit when Rihanna plays. That's the beauty of Roskilde - there's always something entirely different on offer.,0
C.A.R.T på roskilde!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Word up mr. Black Daniels!  ),0
Indeed with that guy. ^,0
Big up Theo Nymark,0
It's a nice thing that we have nothing short of 8 stages  which means that you have 7 stages to go to when Rihanna is playing.,0
Alcohol should do the trick anyway <3,0

you don't need WIFI when you're on Roskilde Festival,0
Old phones = much battery Very charge Such savings wow,0
Oh yes I see now! I always take an old phone to festivals  send the odd text  that's about all I need to do. Who wants to worry about a smartphone at roskilde!,0
There wasn't a single possession that I took in 2007 that didn't get wet!,0
I hate smart phones and they suck... but if someone could bring one and get the roskilde app for it  just in case I need it  that would be sweet.,0

They accepted it at NorthSide  and it came in hand!,0
Of course not!,0

It came in handy because their other means of payment all failed. The pay band was just about the most moronic invention since... I don't even know what.,0

Rihanna can really perform live. If you won't take our word for it  have a look here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W-poRSA9do  This is not the first time we've booked pop music - and yes  we even book BIG pop artists once in a while.,0
As I write  I have no problem with Rihanna or her music  she makes great pop music  aimed at teenage girls and radiofriendly crowds and THAT'S why i question the decision  it's regarding the AUDIENCE she attracts. You can simply not deny that a huge percentage of her audience are not your typical festivagoers in general and most of them are likely not to be interested in any of the other acts playing AND understanding the  spirit  of Roskilde. Also  You can't just write of pop music as being all the same and drawing the same crowds. Both Prince  Robbie and Kanye can be regarded as POP  but they are totally different in presentation  style and audience. It just seems to me  that this is a booking made purely for financial reasons  with no real regard to the  spirit  of Roskilde  that you yourselves like to promote. I'm all for diversity  but this booking is just way off.,0
^ Second this.,0
We book artists whom we believe will pull off a great show. That's our number one. And we still encourage you to press play on the video above - then you'll see Rihanna in a FESTIVAL setting really delivering the goods.  Robbie Williams  to take another example  has played at Roskilde TWICE back in the day. You can say that he's not your typical lineup representative  and the same thing goes with whoever he might attract among the audience. Why is it dangerous to attract a crowd that appreciates pop music - whoever the act is?,0
Michael Panduro  read the answer above as well (we'll write in English because this is an 'open line' and we have users from all over the world - just in case you're wondering),0
Better answer this time (and I was obviously a bit fast in concluding the stage show wasn't festival-compatible). For me  Roskilde has always been about the smaller bands  and I see nothing wrong in booking big pop acts. I do still agree with Christian  though  that this choice seems a bit pubescent. I'm pretty sure that One Direction and Justin Bieber pull of pretty impressive live shows as well  but it seems (admittedly a bit more) improbable  that we'll see them at Roskilde.,0
I really miss some funk music at roskilde. Which i think will pleasure the audience well and is a part of the roskilde  spirit .,0
what a nice way to talk down to the audience,0
As Christian says  the problem isn't neccesarily pop audiences as a whole  but a crowd generally of the less festival-going kind. Robbie Williams as a solo artist is nothing like Rihanna in this matter. You have spent years promoting  the orange feeling   and last year you had a good campaign for making audiences listen to the music and not talk during concerts. Regrettably  I have a feeling that some of the people who will be going to rf13 based on this booking alone (and a lot of people will  I'm sure)  will contribute less to the concept of the orange feeling  and make this concert as well as others more like any other concert (where people talk  shout  cut lines  stumble along in high heels and complain about the toilets...*) You have done bad bookings before as well (that's why I can say this from experience)  but that's hardly an argument  and this is one of the worst headliners I can remember.  (*OK  I'm generalizing for effect.)  Oh well  all PR is good PR i guess... Hope you follow this up with some bookings in the traditional orange spirit  be it pop or rock.,0
Heino Juul  that was not the intention. We don't want to get all defensive here  just trying to explain things.   Roskilde Festival should not be seen as a closed/exclusive club. It should be for everyone - AND by getting a new audience in here  we can influence them with the Roskilde spirit  which Christian seems to refer to. That way we can make them Roskilde people by exposing them to all the other kinds of music. Roskilde is one big fusion of music genres - and that's what we''re proud of presenting. You don't really see that anywhere else.,0
rihanna is a one day ticket seller be logic about it... many of those customers behave really negative and careless towards other festivalgoers... i have experienced that negative progression the last couple of years,0
Lea Inger-Helene: We totally respect your feelings and opinions about this  though we see it differently  but isn't it a bit drastic to put all Rhianna's fans in the  ignorant  shouting  couldn't care less -box?,0
  AND by getting a new audience in here  we can influence them with the Roskilde spirit  which Christian seems to refer to. That way we can make them Roskilde people by exposing them to all the other kinds of music.   Roskilde usually dont have problems selling tickekts  and you are known world wide for the  Orange Feeling  and great music.   So why do you need to use (maybe) the biggest amount of money and a headliner  to  educate  people who are normally not into Roskilde?,0
Roskilde Festival I agree  that's why I put the asterisk in. I have nothing against individuals who listen to Rihanna. I listen to Rihanna as well... In bodypump classes at my gym...  -) Now give me Kaizers Orchestra and David Bowie for this year and we're more than good :-),0
I feel like you're not really reading what I'm writing. You're talking about  pop  as if it's one and the same. I already used Robbie as an example and I do believe that there's a difference between him and Rihanna. AND  it's in NO way  Dangerous  to attract a different and diverse crowd  BUT there a just some crowds  whom I just dont see working in a festival environment and that's the sort of crowd I see Rihanna drawing. You can't escape the fact that Rihanna is primarily aimed at teenage girls and PLEASE dont tell me that you think that they are the type of people that will enjoy Roskilde. And just to make it clear  there's nothing WRONG with that  I can understand why some people don't like to sleep in tent's etc. etc.,0
Dennis and Christian: Okay - here goes...  [bringing out the crazy preacher] We honestly believe that the festival chances people - both in front of the stages  and by all the things that goes on around at the festivalgrounds and between the festivalgoers. There's some kind of special magic in the mix and YOU are the ones who make it  this Orange Feeling.  YOU  being a very  very diversified group of people listening to all kinds of music. Diversity is key and has been for a long time.  People not into Roskilde  generelly becomes  into Roskilde  after they have been here (sold out for three years in a row now and constantly taking in  new people ).... And sometimes  because of this  you get to experience something new  something you didn't really look for  because we actually HAVE put thought behind our mix of music (even though you might agree or not agree - some even find it mad and personally insulting). Call it education or call it  gently poking possible experiences at you  - both Rihanna fans and not-Rihanna fans. There is idea behind it all. So let's make a deal: If you go to the festival this year and go out amongst the people  and yet again get lots in it all  and DO NOT STILL feel that love and Orange Feeling  well  then we have failed - and we owe you an apology and something for your hangovers. [/crazy preacher over and out]  ps. And yes  we do also of course (on the less crazy preacher side) actually think that the show is gonna be the bomb (a good bomb  that is).,0
but still you answer us like we are first time goers to the festival,0
roskilde - on your homepage you've said that this year it's all building up to an ultimate point the last day ( building up the festival feeling day by day ). My question ! Is Rihanna the big final show ?,0
Heino: How would you want us to answer you? Do we think that the Rihanna-fans  can't handle Roskilde ? That they are  not fit for Roskilde ? No  we don't think so. One year ago when we pulled out the Apollo Stage some of the exact same thought were stated again and again about  the crowd that listened to electronic music : They were not the right kind of people  they wouldn't get the orange feeling and they would snif coke and maybe even beat people up. Well  they didn't. Before that it was  the Hip-Hoppers  who wouldn't fit in. Now Hip-Hop is one of the most wished for genres. Things change - discussions don't - and no matter what  we do not believe in boxing whole groups of people up. I don't believe we can state it much clearer,0
Lea Inger-Helene: Well  we'll see. Otherwise you'll just have to do a lot of bodypump at the festival this year  -),0
Ola: Final schedule is not out before mid-june,0
I also think Robbie Williams is an awful booking for Roskilde old boyband sucker with no real talent....but two wrongs doesn´t make a right. Rihanna is maybe the biggest name in pop right now. That makes it worse. She will draw a massive crowd of careless youngsters to the festival who don´t give a shit about music. Before you had super names like M.I.A or the excellent concert from last year by Santigold (could easily be on Orange stage). Urban/pop is important for the diversity  but most of the real music lovers will now be scared of going to Roskilde  not because of Rihanna  but the crowd she will bring  this is a shame. It might even destroy the festival as we know it.,0
I honestly don't understand your arguments. Electronic and Hip Hop has ALWAYS been a part of Roskilde!? And it's not about Rihanna fans  not being able to handle Roskilde   I dont think that they WANT to. It's not their  thing   which is fair. People are different! Roskilde is an EXPERIENCE  not just a single koncert and with a line-up as the current one  that's how i fear that her crowd will treat it. There is currently NOTHING else on the programme  that I see the average  teenage Rihanna fan relating to. I also think that you've kindda lost perception of what Roskilde  does  to people. No matter how you wrap it  it's still an outdoor festival on a field  where people stay in tents and normal/common things as a shower  proper meals etc. are harder to come by the usual. I think it's real arrogant to think  that you can  convert  anybody  just because you're Roskilde Festival.,0
Talking about diversity  it's criminal how jazz-music has ALWAYS been passed by at Roskilde. I realize there's a big Jazz Festival in Copenhagen just after Roskilde  but still...,0
As long as you book either graveyard or witchcraft or both. I'm happy  -),0
Hey. Just have a few questions that I hope you can answer now. I'm trying to get all my camp's money together so we can get our tickets on Nov 17.  1. How much are full fest tickets for 2016? Usually they go up around €10 every year but just wanted to make sure.  2. Will there be an option to get free space for booking 10 tickets together  like last year?  3. Can Area B be made a get space area? It's a pain in the ass when people run all the way down from the top of West and there's no space left because some crafty folks have managed to get in through the bottom gate,0
Yih  what he said. I'm also intredasted in this and I bet many more are too.,0
Hi Steen. We can reveal more about ticket options and prices on 17 November when they come up for sale.,0
Makes it hard to plan..,0
It would be rude not to.,0
This was spotted in the refugee camp Kara Tepe on Lesbos.  Hundreds of tents and sleeping bags  donated by the Roskilde-goers  have been sent down to help out a bit.  Thanks Flygtninge på Lesbos  for the pic.,232

that so much joy and fun then so much tragedy and sadness has been contained in the same tent  is very discomforting and thought-provoking... x,0

As long as you got your bracelet then no problem,0
Thank you sir!,0
What Peter said.,0
The shuttle bus or train will  cost.you a bit.,0
After giving this more thought I may just try to tough it out in my tent  it may be a better Roskilde experience . Since I can't get my tent package until Sunday at 18:00  I'll get a hotel or hostel for Saturday night June 28th.,0
Vince Grafiada  that's the optimal experience if you ask us. Maybe area J (clean & silent) is right for you - if you don't want to sleep right next to huge  noisy stereos.,0

There are so many people who wants to watch the footballs. To them: Sell your tickets to all the desperate people who wants to hear music.  Or please shut up  and be happy you got a ticket. People want it.,0
I really can't see anything wrong with wanting to do both. As soon as you've bought the ticket you're free to do whatever you want with it. If that's watching a game of football then so be it.,0
It's just so spoiled. I'd like the cinema back  can't see why that can't happen. I'd also like the ice skateing ring back  nude race all the days  an ice machine  more room for camping  golf carts to drive med around  electricity at the camp site ect. ect...  Be glad for what you get  go somewhere else to watch your footie if you want to. This year there is no football  they have explained why  accept it.,0
Who the f*** are you to decide what people should do? I want to watch football AND be at Roskilde. Are you the RF police? No  so please  sell your ticket so I don't have a chance to see your face there.,0
Shut up yourself  twat.,0
People have gone about their criticism in a spoiled way  I agree there. But it's really not hard to understand seeing as the tournaments have been screened the last few times. And I do believe some people will go to nearby bars or the like for the football. But let's see  we all know how difficult it can be to get out of the campsite. The removal of the cinema has been criticised as well. Again  I think it's understandable.  It's as if you feel Roskilde Festival can't be criticised in regards to stuff that isn't music (this is me guessing by the way). Whereas I think it's perfectly fine to criticise a festival spending a lot of it's time on marketing itself as  more than music  in relation to subjects that aren't music. Be that the world cup  European cup  cinema etc. I'm sure the feedback on the decision is appreciated as well as that will help on the decision making in the future. Especially with regards to how the festival has argued its omission of the screening of the games. I really can't see anything wrong with people wanting to optimise their experience at the festival. And I'm sure you'd be able to organise a nude race everyday by the way :),0
Søren  no name-calling here  please.,0
Sorry  we're not screening the World Cup.,0
There are plenty of people that want to buy tickets so you shouldnt have any problems selling it.,0

Hello Roskilde Festival When are Roskilde planning to have free wifi in the festival area? Coming from Norway its very expensive to use 3G all day. And to be able to fully use your festival APP I need to use the 3G if there is no Wifi. And I loved your APP last year  that was before I came to the festival where I realized I could not use it. I thought it was so brilliant  but I still could not use it due to financial irritations :-D Will I be able to use it this year?  -),0
You could buy a Danish  taletidskort  in a supermarket and stick it in your phone  that way you will have a Danish number and a Danish 3G dataplan  cheap and easy solution.,0
Free = doesnt work at all. I even payed for Wifi in 2012 and it never worked  ),0
Thank you Lars.,0
Wait and see if there is free Wifi!  ),0

Hello Roskilde Festival   I might have missed it in an earlier post  but have this year’s map come up yet? I can’t find it on the web page yet. The days are creaming closer and closer  and it would be nice to plan the camps placement soon.  Hope you can help  ),0
Do you need any special pass to skate the skatepark at the festival or can you just bring your skates and skate it whenever you like? Danke,0
In the unlikely event that you lack inspiration for bookings for this year (as if!)  this wonderful series of short  intimate concerts should perk you up. 200 of them and it's all fabulous stuff. Perfect for your small club tent. Just watched Lucius who are stupendous. Enjoy!,0

Hahaha thats a joke right? Please say it is!!,0
What the fuck!??!? Worst booking ever  what is she doing at a Fedtival????,0
I LOVE IT !,0
After thinking it over I come to the conclusion: I think I have to boycott Roskilde. It is the audiences' money you waste for shit like this. Which means 50 other good bands cannot be paid & you will have to make a list of bands never heard & not even good. It is like a bad joke that you asked for band suggestions before. If you see the reactions here  it is obvious that most people dislike such  music . It is not even Pop  it is sterile Chartshit. I have been to Roskilde so many times  there were always bands I liked or not. Like usual. But I can't support a festival with a headliner like this. Sorry Roskilde.,0
Is this still supposed to be a rock festival  or have I missed out on something? Please come with something good soon.,0
Nice to hear that your heart is in it. Keep it up! All opinions are cool  pissed or thrilled  but please keep the tone. Too much hate only makes you older (and your comment hidden if it's over the line),0
like most of my Roskilde comrades  I'm not too particularly fond of the modern (mainstream) music industry  but I have to admit Rihana is one of the few good ones out there  fuk the haters,0

What a shame  Roskilde. What's next? Backstreetboys? Britney? Bieber? For that money you could book 20 acts like Flogging Molly  Gogol Bordello  Skunk Anansie  The National  Sick of it All  Slayer... But you prefer one pop star and a bunch of bands people never heard about. ,0

Arhmm for fucks sake Roskilde !!! Why piss away money when you could get muse depeche mode  soundgarden  Green Day   daft punk  foo Fighters .... You didn't learn your lesson with MIA,0
This is stupid,0
What is wrong with Roskilde!!!! Are you kidding? Where is the Real Music?! Where is the rock?! Since 2007 there only has been some few real roskilde artist!,0
LOVE IT!! <3,0
Good thing I never bought a ticket. People who saw her at Peace & Love last year in Borlänge know what I'm talking about. She was 45 minutes late (biggest scene  closing act the very last day)  barely knew the lyrics of her own songs and looked like she was sleepwalking. There was a big queue to get out if the festival area. Reportedly she was paid 10 million SEK. Even though nobody was forced to go and see her  P&L had increased that year's revenue by quite a lot and if you were a volunteer (like I was) they had increased the amount of work hours from 24 to 32. This year it's back to 24 so hopefully that means there'll be no ridiculous pop whore bookings for 2013.,0
Even on snl she is terrible. Are you not seeing what People are asking for?,0
Ho is We? Spectacular? Fuck!,0
Completely unable to give a fuck...,0
Has anyone seen my keys?,0
No... Just.. No? ,0
OMFG!!! THAT IS GONNA BE A PARTY!!! THANKS ROSKILDE <3,0
Ugh... Disgusting. I'm definitely not going now.,0
.. and NorthSide it is.,0
Or my dog?,0
comparing Rihanna to Justin Bieber and One direction. Very funny guys. I wouldve rather seen daft punk/muse/blur but well this is all right. Maybe on the next announcement.,0
omg!? why use all the money on a singer whom mostly draws 13 year old girls!?,0
I really hope RF books something insane to make up for this. If there's any money left...,0
what a waist of money,0
Hahaha  people staying home because they don't like one artist. That's very funny. It seems to be a big problem that loud guitars dosen't come form Orange for a couple of hours. Or are they afraid of people who like r&b and popmusic?,0
Spectacular poop party  more like.,0
http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-dont-want-to-live-on-this-planet-anymore,0
Bu....but she sucks!?!,0
Thats that the end of a good ROCK festival..!!!  Soooooo sad it had to go the pop music i dont got an oppinion on any music kinda way..,0
what the fuuuuuck is this?,0
WTF ?! Could you please invite Rage against the Machine instead of Rihanna ?,0
Well  why not David Bowie instead? He's releasing a new album this year  and since Roskilde festival seems to have quite some money to  waste   rather spend it on a REAL pop star! David Bowie at Roskilde  now that would be a REAL pop party...,0
Why,0
Indeed why not Bowie instead?,0
I assume Bowie isn't available  as no human would choose rihanna instead?,0
FUCK THAT SHIT,0
Liam  where does it say that Rihanna is instead of Bowie?,0
You got to be fuckin' kidding me :(,0
Please tell us the price!,0
She's fucking terrible  she was at peace and love last summer and hers was by far the worst of the concerts i want to,0
Elias: Roskilde-folket?? How do you define them? Are we 80 000 people who like the same music  don't think so. Are we 80 000 people who likes to party  yes I'm pretty sure of that.  I'm sure you'll see many many more in front of orange stage at Rihanna than for example Machine Head (who were great) last year. Don't judge my or for that matter any other Roskildegoers musictaste.,0
Oh well... I hope you bring some other REALLY great bands to the line-up  otherwise I would be devastated...,0
Konas and Liam:  Bowie's producer has just annouced that there will be no tour to follow his  upcoming release in 2013: http://gaffa.dk/nyhed/68097  So no 'Rihanna feat: David Bowie' this year on Roskilde.  ),0
Grow up  people.,0
I bet she wasnt cheap to book. Infact she was prob very expensive. But all the single guys can celebrate now that rihanna has increased the amount of the single girls :),0
Aw rats!! Forgot to write in english!! Oh well  as long as it's only the danes who weep and complaint  then it should be no problem!!  ),0
no please  whyyyy  ??!! ! ! ! !,0
I think you are fucking up the program!,0
ha ha thats gonna be so funny,0
@Mattias Larsson: So if Roskilde Pop Festival booked Justin Bieber - it would be perfectly fine  since it wouldl be crowded in front of the stage? I think your logic is flawed.,0
Okay. Here goes (insert crazy preacher voice)...  [crazy preacher] We honestly believe that the festival changes people - both in front of the stages  and by all the things that goes on around at the festivalgrounds and between the festivalgoers. There's some kind of special magic in the mix and all of YOU are the ones who make it  this Orange Feeling.  YOU  being a very  very diversified group of people listening to all kinds of music. Diversity is key and has been for a long time.  People not into Roskilde  generelly becomes  into Roskilde  after they have been here (sold out for three years in a row now and constantly taking in  new people ). One year ago when we pulled out the Apollo Stage  some of the exact same thoughts were stated again and again about  the crowd that listened to electronic music : They were not the right kind of people  they wouldn't get the orange feeling  they were wearing too much white and they would snif coke and maybe even beat people up. Well  they didn't. Before that it was  the Hip-Hoppers  who wouldn't fit in. Now Hip-Hop is one of the most wished for genres. Things change - discussions don't - and no matter what  we do not believe in boxing whole groups of people  genres or music up. And sometimes  because of how the program is put together  you get to experience something new  something you didn't really look for  because we actually HAVE put thought behind our mix of music (even though you might agree or not agree - some even find it mad and personally insulting). Call it education or call it  gently poking possible experiences at you  - both Rihanna fans and not-Rihanna fans. There is idea behind it all. So let's make a deal: If you go to the festival this year and go out amongst the people  and yet again get lots in it all  and DO NOT STILL feel that love and Orange Feeling  well  then we have failed - and we owe you an apology and something for your hangovers. [/crazy preacher]  ps. And yes  we do also of course (on the less crazy preacher side) actually think that the show is gonna be the bomb (a good bomb  that is)  and we do have space  time and ressources for 199 other acts. pps. And are you still allowed to wholeheartedly disagree with this booking? Fuck yeah! Just don't box whole groups of people  and keep the tone (and don't say  fuck  to much btw),0
I think people will have a hard time understanding that Rihanna is only 1/200 - in the budget. But you can book exactly who you want to. I just don't have to concider buying such an expensive ticket anymore :-),0
jesus take the wheel !,0
If this truly is a problem for you  then enjoy your nice real-problem-free life,0
Every time Roskilde get criticism  they use the  preacher voice   to tell what Roskilde is all about. Still the best one is   Vi booker ikke til hr. og fru. Danmark ,0
Every year I think about returning and then you do this. I don't agree with judgemental comments calling people who like Rihanna stupid  but Roskilde is a different festival  not focused on profit as the other but in the atmosphere  ecology  conscience  and giving space to new and rising artists. Yes  people who are into Rihanna maybe can  learn the Orange Spirit   but in what Rihanna contributes more to this festival than the 25 medium or big sized groups that you could hire with that money?,0
@Dennis N.: But at least now we warn you of the preacher voice beforehand  -) Joke aside. Criticism is welcome. Debate and diverse opinions has always planted more good  than bad. It was the whole 'all these Rihanna people over there are like this  and I know this  and they are going to ruin MY festival  that was getting a bit tedious.,0
Yeah  I agree with Luiz. Bring in the indies!,0
Orange feeling just died,0
Yo Roskilde Festival  the thing that just can't be justified (no matter how much  crazy preacher  you throw at us) is that this is a deeply insincere commercial act. That's why it's /not/ the same as with hip-hop and electronic. Taste is one thing - embracing new or different crowds is far from a bad thing  -  but going in the direction of (face it) intentionally un-artistic acts like the top40 machine you've thrown at us just now  really isn't a wise move. People love Roskilde because it has a serious approach to the music program  and even though the rest of this years lineup isn't looking too shabby (AnCo!)  we'd all hate to see Roskilde slowly transition into another Tomorrowland.,0
Mads: Do you know anything about Rihanna? Obviously not. I have nothing against Bieber but comparing them two is stupid. People seem to be insulted that Rihanna is played on commercial radio and attract younger fans? I just don't get all the anger. Infact I don't understand it all Quit going because they don't like Rihanna just make me laugh. If they think the programme suck after the big release in april fine but skipping the best party all summer cause Rihanna is booked is just stupid.,0
Roskilde is all about diversity- thousands and thousands of people gather in Roskilde  regardless of age  gender and nationality  and to believe that every single one of them prefers the same type music is not only naïve but rather inaccurate   If listening to Rihanna isn’t desirable  do something else for two hours  it cannot be that hard? The Roskilde line-up offers a wide range of music genres  and one cannot read the list of artist and claim that the selection is monotonous. Rihanna is a contribution to the diversity.  See (some of) you at roskilde 2013! :),0
Asbjørn Olling  every festival wants the ratings of Tomorrowland...,0
Complete disregard of the value of money. This sad excuse for a woman better not perform the same day as Sigur Rós  only bothering with a single-day ticket this year.,0
Roskilde Festival: your answer just shows  that you understood NOTHING. Your ignorance and even arrogance against other opinions is the beginning of the end. We are talking about the headliner  not some hip hop or electronic experiments on smaller stages. A headliner is a statement it represents a festival and its  vibe  - the Roskilde feeling that you don't get tired to preach  Roskilde preacherman. If anyone asked me:  Hey  Roskilde  who are the headliners?  I would just feel ashame to tell this person it is Rihanna. Rihanna is imho not even music. It is industry  commercial crap. Maybe you don't even have to pay too much for her  because for all the advertising / product placement she can do on stage. Who knows. It is not about the Rihanna fans  they might be as nice as others. But they live in another world and I definetely think most of them don't fit into Roskilde  getting stuck in the mud with their heels and Pussy Deluxe (sorry: product placement) bags. How cute. For sure some Danish beau will take care of them  before Rihanna bombs everything with her show as you say  preacherman.... a huge mudbomb. Splash.,0
Jorg  it's big and it's profitable  admittedly  but nobody wants the reputation of Tomorrowland.,0
@Roskilde Festival  u have already given me that answer in another comment  but it has nothing to do  with what i am asking. i try again: U have one of the best Festival brands in the world  and are almost sold out every year. There are already so many different cultures and people  even alot of pop. I just wonder why  you need to use (maybe) the biggest amount of money and a headliner  to  change/educate  people who are normally not into Roskilde and improve the Orange feeling  which is already perfect? The Orange Feeling is perfect  so focus on the musik. Still looking forward to Roskilde 13 :),0
Asbjørn Olling my man you are crazy. Festival owners would do everything they could to be like the best festival ever. Roskilde is too  maybe why the just announced Rihanna.,0
Seriously? I'm glad SlipnoT is showing up  atleast there will be SOME good music. In other words I  personally  hope Rihanna cancels.,0
Oliver:  the headliner ? Since when was there only one headliner on Roskilde? Last time I checked  there were between 7-9 headliners every year. Should be enough to go around the plate. Three other headliners this year (QOTSA  Slipknot and Volbeat) are rock names of varying degrees of heaviness. Have you forgotten about them? Roskilde isn't defined by one puny name  but by the 199 others.  As for advertising and product placement  most headliners at most festivals have their ass stuffed full of free clothes. Deal with it. Your comment about Rihanna's fans just goes to show that you are even more ignorant and arrogant than you accuse the moderator of this site to be.  Fact is  Roskilde has always booked big pop names to accompany the myriad of other stuff that bobs around in the programme. From the top of my head  I can think of names such as Aqua  Thomas Helmig  Niklas  Daniel Bedingfield  M.I.A.  Duffy  Lily Allen  Pet Shop Boys  Kanye West (twice)  Burhan G  Prince  Lykke Li  Jay-Z  Lupe Fiasco  Robyn  Fedde Le Grand  Nephew (several times)  Scissor Sisters  Junior Senior  Outlandish  Travis  Nelly Furtado  P. Diddy  N*E*R*D  Chumbawamba  Robbie Williams (twice) – all of which have performed at Roskilde in  my time . Many of these are arguably as  pop  as Rihanna. Nothing new to see here folks  move along.,0
Answer to oliver (who wrote the text in the quote:)  “…it is not about the Rihanna fans  they might be as nice as others. But they live in another world and I definetely think most of them don't fit into Roskilde  getting stuck in the mud with their heels and Pussy Deluxe (sorry: product placement) bags.”  First of all  I am a Rihanna fan and I can guarantee that we both live in the same world :) (and i haven't  or will never bring my heels or pussy deluxe bag to roskilde)  Second  you should be careful with your assumptions. If you seriously think that all Rihanna fans are girls wearing heels getting stuck in the mud I would only suggest you to think twice! And even if we were girls wearing heels  what gives you the right to decide which people who “fit into Roskilde?:)  it's all about diversity.,0
I don't know one single Rihanna song  and I probably never will!! During her performance you Can find me at the Trucker bar (MC Roskilde) behind Orange Stage,0
Anyone want to but my ticket  ?,0
@Dennis: Our answer to you is two-fold and quite simple (agree you may or may not): 1. We do not believe that Roskilde Festival is not for people who listens to Rihanna  since we do not believe in 'boxing' people and 2) We really do think that Rihanna is going to deliver a mindblowing act. If not  why the hell should we book her. As Anders C said there's been lots of 'pop' names through the ages. Nothing new and there is no real hidden arrogance behind it.,0
 We do not believe that Roskilde Festival is not for people who listens to Rihanna Plenty of over Festivals Roskilde don't get,0
@ Anders You missed the point. Like last year Roskilde concentrated on 1 headliner (Springsteen). The others are just co-headliners. And it is an insult to most of the others to compare them with Rihanna  just because they showed up in the charts. Charts = Pop? You gotta learn my friend.  -),0
I bet that everyone here will be singing along in a song or two  stop hateing. I dont rage over Vol Beat beeing booked for the 100th time  well i guess I am...,0
What's the difference between Rihanna and Slipknot? Dosen't both want to sell records. Both on big labels. Both mix image with songs. Both make commercial videos etc etc.  Is one true and one false? I have never understood that discussion and i'm surely looking forward to both of them. I just can't understand why Rihanna causing so much anger. She's good  for real. Great voice and some great songs.,0
FUCK THAT SHIT,0
Wouldn't it be awesome if Rhianna performed to an empty field  because everyone protested against her rubbish  over-produced pop wankery  and instead went to watch something better somewhere else?  Message sent.,0
@Roskilde Festival  Come on  i've never said that?....the problem is not pop or the fans of Rihanna  both are more than welcome :) I just wonder why  you book such a  untypical  and expensive (i guess) headliner for Roskilde  to maintain and improve the Roskilde feeling (and have a party).  Why not keep focus  on the the current people(customers) at the festival  when we are talking this year biggest headliner  instead of attracting new customers. Roskilde is sold out almost every year  respected all over the world for the line-up and the atmosphere  so why take such a big chance? I love that you book different and new artits every year  but Rihanna as a headliner  i just can't understand.,0
We wanna ROCK!,0
@Dennis: Well  the magic is in the mix as said before. It's all about diversification - music  people  experiences - you name it. It's always been like that (just look at our old posters). New festivalgoers? We are all about attracting new festivalgoers. And on top of that we firmly believe that Rihanna is gonna put on a blast of an act. Is Rihanna a bigger chance to take than with any other headliner  or will she win the crowd? Well  'comments' on this thread says one thing  while 'likes' are skyrocketing. So it isn't that clear cut  and if it's not you  then dive towards our other stages. BTW: Thanks for the kind words  ),0
@ Anna! Please don't take it too serious. Humour sometimes lives from exaggeration. I just had this picture in mind of desperate & lost girlies stuck in the mud. But you should really be aware of Rihanna's mudbomb.  -),0
Stop whining.... Rihanna is a worldstar and a natural booking for a festival like Roskilde. Much better then feks Bjørk if u ask me. I went to Rock in Rio to enjoy lots of rock and metal sept 2011. Rihanna also performed there and its quite a show she is putting on..  If u dont care  so find another stage then,0
WTF!!! I'm chocked. Are U guys going to upper age limit this year!!!!! I'm feeling old  and starting to think U forgot that U call yourselves a rock festivval...,0
HAHAHAHAHAHAH! Its like throwing cash ina fire. Just look st her last europe-trips..,0
Jesper. They don't call themselves a rock festival. They call themselves a music event  and has done so for the last 11 years.  Emil. Friday/Saturday Orange stage closing act has been pop or popular electronic music the last 10 years more often than not. The Cardigans  Fat Boy Slim  Duran Duran  Scissor Sisters  Kanye West  Chemical Brothers  Pet Shop Boys  M.I.A.  and Deadmau5 spring to mind.,0
Somehow I can't see her do a worse job than Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2007 or Nephew in 2010. Will I see her? Likely not. But if I do  I'm sure it'll be a great show.,0
Rihanna sucks.... If i come to this years Roskilde Festival.... so are this for Kvaltrak  Volbeat  Queens Of The Stone Age and Slipknot for now.... NOT for Rihanna.... so far  the worest name on the festival.... but it´s just my intention..... of course....,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7siVSslHPMQ  You might win some...........,0
Embarrassing booking. She put on a worthless show last year in Sweden at P&L.,0
@Dennis: Shouldn't that be autotune? It is one of peoples main complains. :/,0
The festival. Not Rihanna.,0
okeey  Im still waiting for something good to come to roskilde  slipknot was fun almost 10 years ago  queens of the stone age is on hell of a band  but im not going as it seems right now...,0
If I were you  I would save the money to get a real band  a great band  a huge band  why not Foofighters? Blink 182? Muse? Underoath? there are alot of bands you could book  I hope you'll book something great,0
Dynamit: You do realise that only 10% of the bands have been announced so far. Isn't it a bit early to say  that you're not going. I'm not a fan of Rihanna  but I must respect that she has more likes than the other three headliners combined and since I like the other headliners I already have three must sees among the headliners  and 180 bands still to come. I think the bookings have started quite good this year.,0
As for me  I couldn't care less about Rihanna  but you will need to waste much much more money  on artists I don't listen to  to keep me away from Roskilde  that's for sure. So good luck with that.  ),0
 We need a line up with pulling power  Unleash the whores! ,0
Justin Biber or Hannah Montana would be great! Hahaha Rihanna... I won't come this year.,0
Robert  Rihanna's grandmother died a few hours before the Peace and Love festival appearance. Can't really blame her for a sub-par performance. Many would probably have canceled instead.,0
No way I'm gonna buy a Roskilde ticket when a big deal of the money spent on it will contribute to paying Rihannas performance..,0
what about kesha  katy perry and robbie williams! would fit perfectly!,0
Krissie: Actually Robbie has headlined Roskilde – twice.,0
This used to be a good festival,0
I bet you 10 000 000kronor that she Will cancel in The last minute.,0
Double-book Chris Brown to the same stage and time! Might bring some quality to the concert!,0
waht a genre mix Slipknot and Rihanna XD omg,0
Why oooo why... What the heck has happend to good  old Roskilde Festival?? :-(,0
The return of the Näspratare,0
Congratz. One year after Sweden like usual,0
I seriously hope this is a joke,0
Daar moeten we heen Richard Broodman Shine bright like a diamond!,0
I f***ing hate it when piss poor  pop  artistes like Rihanna get signed up for big outdoor rock festivals.,0
Joke she's not even talented... Just her popularity with the teenie boppers that keep her in the limelight...,0
Why  she uses playback and in many cases singback + she is going to be late and high out of her mind! You would get a better preformance from a CD,0
Worst signing of all time,0
I was considering going to Roskilde this year. I've reconsidered.,0
Last year at peace And love festival she was 1 hour late  high as fuck and auto tuned the whole consert. N1,0
Noooooo! It's going to be shit then,0
Fuck this mainstream shit. I'll go and get wasted at some other festival this year!,0
worst choice  now just book Katy Perry or better Playback Britney and you can pretty much cancel the whole thing. i doubt Rihanna fans want to stay in a tent plus will their parents even allow them to go?,0
Wow look at all these negativity from random people! I pretty much dont give a damn about Rihanna but I tell you this people  Stay home then  you dont have to buy a Roskilde ticket and if you must anyway... Lucky you then there is probably 183 more bands/artists to go see then. Less complaining  more love in your life?!!,0
plarp. It's not about that  it's using Rihanna to sell the tickets. Loads of people will go just to see her 'perform' and not know who the fuck anyone else is :P,0
Seriously? Fuck that.. Now I'm going to download festival instead,0
just to get more tickets sold. rosilde disappoints me  i wont be there,0
Do you really have the guts to call this crap music? Do me a favour..get lost!,0
The fuck...,0
You must be joking.,0
That's horrible. Roskilde is supposed to be a sanctuary where you shouldn't have to cope with awful mainstream «artists»..,0
We don´t want a spectacular pop party  we want Oracular Spectacular. Give us MGMT!,0
Just sayin´.....,0
It’s Friday and we feel like donating.  We give DKK 400 000 (approx. EUR 54 000) to Save the Children Youth because their activities give children a better experience at the Danish asylum centres.  Photo: Kathrine Aggerholm,27

I find it appalling that you exhibit these ladies great creativity in festival cookery as something that could be/done better. I would give them five stars compared to canned corn  tuna and mackerel. free beers to the person who makes me a grilled frozen pizza :D :D :D,0
TIME-OUT BURGER,0
When are you releasing the food  programme ,0
Fuck I'm so excited about the god damn flæskesteg. Get me on that flight.,0
Will you have the burgers that was sold right by the Pavillion this year as well? (they were the best burgers I've ever had :p) Dixieburger I believe the place was called?,0
Hey guys  I was talking with some friends last year while crawling back to our tents about getting some nice soup. This year we took it further and made our little Soup Camp and we were wondering if there is any way we can talk to somebody around the  make your own food  place and make lots of soup for all the friends at Roskilde Festival. I would like to talk a bit more with someone about this. Believe me  I make an awesome eastern european soup  ),0
Oliver Michael Sauter absolutely. And we have done that. Currently you can win some beer out in the real world: https://www.facebook.com/events/281985765315798/ and about a week ago we had this on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152012752081706&set=a.99196301705.99302.10248811705&type=1 But photo sharing is just more fun on Instagram,0
Frederik Hjort Brandi  yes. APPetizer will be ready very soon :),0
Johan Roggen-Backwaren Nielsen  we'll certainly give them points for trying! But we doubt that the outcome was successful,0
Flemming Høyer  we'll release it bit(e) by bit(e) during this week and the full  programme  will probably be ready next week,0
Augusta Sofie  if you mean the official Roskilde Festival app  It's ready and available for download :) It still needs a few adjustments though and we're working on that. If you mean the APPetizer  it's not ready yet  but it will be soon.,0
Edvin Tønder  yes! They'll have the same spot as last year,0
Unfortunately  you'll have to wait until Thursday to get that delicious Dixie burger. But there's lots of other good stuff around the campsite,0
Flæskesteg is the best thing ever invented,0
Hi Vlad. Send me an email on mikkel.sander@roskilde-festival.dk and I will hook you up with the people in the DIY open air kitchen i Dream City - Roskilde Festival. It might be too late but we can always try.,0
Vlad Gidea - you should join Dream City - Roskilde Festival!!,0
Go to SKI Burger and order yourself a flæskestegs-sandwich :D,0
I love the passion people share in all the DreamCity projects. All of them are cool  out-of-the-box concepts that are truly impressive. I can only think of helping some of the teams next year :),0
I plan to!!,0
No World Cup screens this year? If that's true it's a really lame decision...  Previous screenings have as popular as midsize concerts and the atmosphere has been really good  is it really better that festival goers watch the games from handheld screens and mobile network gets overloaded during evenings...  Some Roskilde locals might now decent (sport) pub close to the festival area where games could be enjoyed with some kind of RF crowd? Please recommend... Tak i forhand :),0
Thats the problem. They draw attention from the bands/artists that are playing. Thats one of the reasons they wont show the world cup.,0
Mulligans near the roskilde station next to Kvickly usually displays sports events :) that's pretty Much the only one,0
i understand  but they organize shitload of everything else to do at camping and festival area as well (also during concerts)  at least it would have been a thing to do together in front of big screen... well  the dude abides...,0

Hello Roskilde.   Will there be some kind of communal bike trip from Copenhagen to the festival this year?,0
..and dis iz why: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9xfo0MY-r8 <3,0
just publish Daft Punk goddammit!,0
Book Suede and David Bowie please,0
And the Flaming Lips!,0
Flaming Lips are already booked for another major Danish festival. That usually means a no-show at Roskilde  so don't count on them:  As for David Bowie: http://pitchfork.com/news/49125-david-bowie-probably-wont-perform-live-ever-again/,0
I hope we will get some metal rock and hard rock headliner for next year,0
Iron Maiden and Rammstein are gone.,0
Í know and Black Sabbath,0
Lets get the mighty AC/CD!!!!!!!,0
True and Metallica,0
and Slayer. Maybe the whole Big Five. Let Roskilde go 100% heavy metal this year,0
I hope Roskilde are listen to us metalheads :),0
Last chance to wish music for Roskilde 2016. Follow the link and let us know who you think should play here next summer.,2
Check out the unofficial(!) results of the votes at the Roskilde Festival Forum: http://roskilde-festival.community/topic5684.html,0
Hahahahah fuck off!,0
Come on! Max mosspit Jussi!!,0
Who owns this cool R2D2 stereo that was spotted at Roskilde Festival 2015?  Help Helene Vedel Nielsen find the owner. She's throwing a Star Wars-themed party and needs some proper gear!,30
Hi Helene. Thx for the upload! You can write us an email at nicklaspape@gmail.com or krommes@gmail.com,0
If I recall correctly it was a camp in C119 and they were Swedish.,0
I am sure this guy can help.,0

Close your eyes. You’re now the CEO of Roskilde Festival. You can change anything you’d like. Anything. It’s nice to dream big  right?   We want to hear your crazy ideas! Send us a video or a brief text and let us know what your future Roskilde Festival looks like. Send your application to festivalutopia@roskilde-festival.dk. We will invite a limited number of you to take part in an event on 21 November in Copenhagen: a unique event where you’ll be sharing your ideas with a lot of other dedicated festival-goers and some of the festival’s key organisers. Roskilde Festival is for you  and we want to create it with you.,19
Kimberley A. Ross!!!!,0
Yes i have one a personal shower for me with out 20 danish dicks around me like in jail ????,0
1) Definitely more 'Loud&Clean' camps 2) UN Global Goals promos like 'Against Drugs' campaign 3) more yoga/spirituality/naturism 4) a merchandise textile patch for backpacks to  tell  the world of RF. ????,0
Kimberley A. Ross free tickets for girls who goes topless!,0
you're so predictable,0
Kimberley A. Ross shhh!,0
btw I have two ideas that would greatly improve the festival: 1) plant some fucking trees in the camping sites 2) how about a REAL pit at main stage and arena,0
Kimberley A. Ross you're so predictable,0
I would use the word reliable but whatever ^_^,0
oh! wait! I have it! horse tours of the festival! omg i love it! they give you a horse and bring you around the festival,0
Please showering with strangers is like one of the best parts of Roskilde,0
Haha.. bring it on  ),0
I like these. Specially the second one.,0
We'd all like to hear more about your time in Danish jails!,0
I think the get a place area is a separate area. Just like get a tent. You can not enter unless you have a get a place ticket.,0
Mattias  the problem is that you CAN enter this area without a get-a-place-ticket. And Jesper  there is NO information on the website how the distribution of areas is going to work - Roskilde Festival promissed back in March that there were  working on it  but we are still waiting for some info!,0
That’s it. Roskilde Festival 2014 is sold out. We still have a few one-days left for Friday  Saturday and Sunday. But all all-week tickets are gone.  Can’t wait to see you all at #rf14!,537
davs! if you're working as a volunteer  is it necessary to buy an  entrance booking ticket ?  kh,0
Dear Roskilde Festival  there is a mistake on the map - the cinema isn't there. You wouldn't silently remove it  right?  Love  The bitter veteran,0
Hi  I'm traveling to Rosklide from Amsterdam. My return coach leaves at 8.00am from Copenhagen  does the shuttle service leave early enough to allow me to get the coach on time?  Thanks,0
http://politiken.dk/ibyen/fokus/roskildefestival/ECE1863817/folkekrav-i-skylder-en-bowie-koncert-roskilde/ Yeah David Bowie have to come this time :),0

Missing Roskilde Festival. I´m  really looking forward to the next festival :D See you in 2016,0
New documentary about the accident in 2000.   At Roskilde Festival 2015 the tragic event was marked on the very day nine young men from five different countries lost their lives at Roskilde Festival in 2000. The documentary ‘Nine Rocks’ was premiered in the Rising area. ‘Nine Rocks’ is a film about guilt  about sorrow  but also of finding one’s new place in life after the most tragic and life-changing experience. If you didn’t see the documentary at the festival  you can watch it on demand now: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/ninerocks,34
Could you provide a link where to watch it on demand please?,0
You could just follow the link. But since it's too hard to click two times: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/ninerocks,0
People  listen up... we’ve got less than 1000 tickets left.  So if you want to go to Roskilde Festival 2014  you should buy a ticket now. Not tomorrow  but now. Soon we won’t have any more left.  Tickets: http://po.st/RF14ticket,403
How will WiFi work this year? Free for all who is in range? Pre-paid access as the last few years?,0
will the waiting areas also become camp space at some point?,0
That's the plan.,0
Peter's right. Without entrance booking you'll have to wait a couple of hours.,0
Choose any entrance  that's up to you.,0
When will the roskilde app be ready?,0
It is ready and released. Android and iOS...,0
Schedule works fine on my iPad and Samsung phone. Map is not ready yet.,0
It sucks for football fans  we know. But have a look at the matches from Thursday through Sunday. That's roughly from 18:00 until midnight. We don't want to book all kinds of good music and then lure everybody away by showing football at the same time. Same deal in the warm-up days.,0
Thats been the same for the last twenty years. And yes..im that old!,0
We love experienced Roskilde-goers - and we hope you'll enjoy the festival all the same.,0
Well we wint!,0
There's quarter finals only on friday and saturday  and of course it isn't six hours each day. It's a total of six hours football from Wednesday through Sunday. And I really don't buy the  lure away  argument. What about all the different non-music culture events. I guess it's going to be crowdy downtown Roskilde.,0
I agree. From now on its every second years for me and all my roskilde friends. I realy think you should reconcider!,0
Bring a radio,0
whether at the time of Roskilde on the big screens will be shown off with the World Cup 2014?,0
Sorry  we're not screening the World Cup at Roskilde.,0
that's hopefully a really stupid joke  right??!,0
at Roskilde 2012 you shown off  Euro 2012 matches in Poland and Ukraine...,0
Jack Johnson said in 2010 that he would definitely be back - could 2013 be the year? ,0
Hahahahahha :D Jaajajajajaj,0
Come on Roskilde! Let's put some of these bands on thte 2013 list:  How 'bout some of this? Sbtrkt Little Dragon Yuksek Whitest Boy Alive   Or maybe some folk/singer-songwriters like these? Ben Howard Keaton Henson James Vincent McMorrow,0
My three band requests for the RF2013: Triggerfinger - for one hack of a party The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain - for a nice  cosy sunday morning/afternoon Tedeschi Trucks Band for a lesson in blues ,0
I have forgotten whether you have a daily competition  where you can win beer? I have just gotten a mail  where it says  that I've won   Venlig Hilsen  Roskilde Festival's Festival Team . I answered with my address  but didn't really think it through.  Hope you can help.  Sincerely Toke,0
Travis Scott would be sick!,0
Hi there people!  I’m writing my marketing thesis and I've made a survey about the Volt stalls at the festival sites around Europe.  It would mean the world to me if you could take a few minutes of your precious time to fill out the form linked bellow. That way I can finish my thesis (and finally graduate)!  I thank you in advance  you fine  awesome people of Roskilde Festival!  ,0
Please book Twisted Sister to Roskilde Festival 2016 :) https://www.facebook.com/138018010313/photos/a.219589160313.270946.138018010313/10156355359025314/?type=3&theater,0

Hello Roskilde Festival!   We just released a new music video featuring Frank Hvam & Kasper from Klovn.  This is our remix of the classic  You Got The Love   witch  The Source ft Candi Station  made golden few years back! This is our take on this classic and the outcome is Amazing !  A lot of love was put into this project.  Everything was recorded and edited by KSF (Killer Sounding Frequencies) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmXlAzGol6M  KSF is based in sweden and currently number #1 in a remix competition for the superstar Dj   Dirty South  https://wavo.me/groovecruise/dirty-south-remix-competition  For more information and music: https://soundcloud.com/ksficeland  Best wishes  Friðrik & Sigurjón - KSF (Killer Sounding Frequencies),0
Remember  to be part of the contest you have to post it through Instagram using the right tag.,0
But you like it  thats all what i want  ),0
The real question is:  Where is Bowie on the first weekend of July? ,0
http://pitchfork.com/news/49125-david-bowie-probably-wont-perform-live-ever-again/,0
Until the release of the new single noone expected to hear new music from his hands ever again...,0
Roskilde Festival 2016 is underway. We've announced the first 10 acts for next year's festival. Check out our #RF16 playlist and get to know the line-up.,2

Hey Roskilde Festival! When will we see the first pictures of the Avalon Stage  and will it be the same way as you did with Apollo  where you showed some concept arts first  and then i believe u posted a video of the stage later on? I really want to get an impression of the stage soon :D,0
Today we've received these wonderful countdown pix on Instagram.  As always the best daily picture wins beer. Join the fun. The number now is 15.  Follow link for rules: http://instagram.com/p/pBPCVIFeYy/,6
whether at the time of Roskilde on the big screens will be shown off with the World Cup 2014?,0
Cost and they dont want the games to draw attention from the bands. Bring a radio and you can at least listen to the games.,0
Would anyone happen to know at which time of day Nirvana played back in '92? :-),0
Yep. We know. Have a look here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/history/1992/band_schedule/date/709574400/,0
Thanks a lot!,0

Yes! The warm-up days are one massive party in the camping site.  There's also music in the warm-up days on three stages (about 15 bands per day total or so – mostly Scandinavian upcomers).,0
Get them! Go go go!!!,1

This year the Brasilian invitations were AMAZING. i truly want to talk with the curator from south america  i know whats hot and what is up to Roskilde from here! i sent an email to roskilde PR but no answer. You guys HAVE to check out El Efecto.  They have an anti-capitalist approach  play for free in festivals they make in poor areas  good political lyrics and great harmonies  coming from the music university.  They play from heavy metal to latin and brasilian african rythms  criticizing the use of TV as a  voodoo magic  to hipnotize  and tell tales of brasilian Robin Hoods meeting with corrupted rich man like Eike Batista (google him on forbes)  remember to put english lyrics on the youtube options! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F-ZYs2NlYU,0

Sad to hear about the decision not to show the World Cup at Roskilde Festival this year. Some of my best Roskilde memories have been watching football in the warm-up days  in the Company of people from the contires playing  even though they were not Nordic. I hope you change your mind.,0
Ronja Cook learn this..,0
Dear Roskilde festival! I bought a ticket some weeks ago unknown that i would be offered a job as a volunteer! I would rather work as a volunteer  but I have stil paid for the ticket  I have a friend who wants to buy it from me (for the same price as I paid myself ofcourse) But since i paid for the ticket  my name is still on it! will it be a problem for my friend to enter the festival with the ticket  since he is not me? :) or can one change the personal settings of the ticket?,0
That's easy - tickets are not personal  so it's no problem selling it to your friend.  16 days to go!,0
http://www.eventim.de/system-of-a-down-Tickets.html?affiliate=EVE&doc=artistPages%2Foverview&fun=artist&action=overview&kuid=631 Please book System Of A Down to Roskilde also :),0
Iron Maiden are going to play Graspop in Belgium next summer. I hoping also they will come to Roskilde Festival :),0
When will the ticket sale start in november and will we get the first headliner?,0
http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/10/the-cure-announce-north-american-tour-for-2016/,0
Some big names in just 2 days :) ? you need to give us some big metal act like Iron Maiden. The reason is Copenhell got Black Sabbath. So thats why we need some metal headliner for next year.,0
Are you ready to get Roskilde Festival 2016 underway?  We’ve already started the booking process. And next week we’ll serve you a taste of things to come. We’ll give you a handful of acts from many of the genre corners you’ll usually see in a Roskilde line-up.,41

Roskilde Festival I'm ready  though. I'll cancel out Ragib's unready-ness.,0
We'll stick to the original plan then and announce the first acts next week.,0
None can cancel the Orange feelin not even Thor,0
Hi Mathias. Of course. More info next week,0
Hi Atli. Not yet but don't worry. We will let you know as soon as you can secure your ticket for next year. We can't wait to see you again :-),0
I can also not wait to see you. What time will the camping open on june 25?  I hope so i can see Black Sabbath in the evening :),0
We expect it to be like this year. So 4 pm.,0
Ok cool thats means i can see Sabbath in the evening :),0

Hi all! My name is Alex  I am a photographer based in Bali. I would like to ask permission to offer my photography service to capture your holiday time in Bali. Please check out my current works at http://alexanderbarus.wix.com/hellobali and please spread the love…,0
you should just call mad decent and have all the artist that are free  come do some great shows...  AND RUDIMENTAL PLEASE!!!!,0
Hopefully we will get Rangleklods  Efterklang  Turboweekend and Jake Bugg. All of them would do a gig  I would attend!,0
I can't remember if they said anything about it being Danish acts but my guess is it's very likely. Efterklang seems obvious (even though I felt their most recent record was a bit boring)  Indians maybe  I wouldn't bet on Rangleklods since he played last year. Turboweekend and Jake Bugg could be announced as well  even though the latter isn't Danish.,0
Animal Collective will play Roskilde Festival 2013. So will a batch of hip hop acts: Action Bronson  Danny Brown  Joey Badass and Flatbush Zombies Official.  See the lineup here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/bands/,40
THANK YOU BASED GOD,0
AAAARh Danny should've been there in 2012! :(((((((,0
Was looking forward to AC being pronounced  but the hip-hop acts are just amazing! Danny Brown will kill it. Now we just need Kendrick  ),0
AB and FZ 4 Real...? You made the next 171 days  a lot easier...,0
Damn. One year late with the hip hop acts.,0
YES YES YES - this booking is the best ever. Animal Collective :-),0
Would make sense if Action Bronson  Danny Brown  Joey Badass and Flatbush Zombies are touring with A$AP Rocky/MOB and Kendrick like they did tours in the States.So they should come together to Roskilde too.. Would be awsome!! + Doing a European tour... But it might be to many acts..,0
Cool but when will TOOL be anounced?,0
How about Mr. Bowie? He owes one! And Placebo  who will launch a new album this spring? Come on Roskilde! Im counting on you!,0
Never heard of them. That kind of music is it?,0
Mattias Svensson  we've embedded music under each artist on our website. Go have a listen -> roskilde-festival.dk/music,0
Why are they being categorized into the genre of pop...?,0
Sarah Vyeda  We're talking about Animal Collective  right? Dig deep down below the layers of experimentation and you'll find pop tunes. It's very skewed pop  but it's definitely there.,0
Joey Bada$$ and Dannybrown. Roskilde bringing real hip hop back <3 <3,0
Not my kind of music I guess.,0
still no Daft Punk,0
Nikolaj: Well  they aren't touring.,0
Anders: Work some magic :),0
Please book Iron Maiden  Foo Fighters  Blur  Metallica  Roger Waters or maybe U2 if they will play festivals. Maiden was last time in 2011 and Foo Fighters in 2005 and Blur in 2003 and Waters in 2006. U2 was last time in the 80 s.,0
Once again thank you for making #RF15 such an amazing festival. We are very happy to say that we will be ready to kick-start Roskilde Festival 2016 very shortly.,125

THANK YOU  CAPTAIN OBVIOUS(Nikolaj Roth),0
He is a Daft Punk :-),0
The name of the Dutch actress is Famke Beumer Janssen. It's from the movie  100 Feet .,0
Bowie. Bowie. Bowie. Årh thank you Roskilde :),0
the woman on the left is Famke Janssen  in a scene from the movie  100 feet . The man on the right is  as previously stated  Heinrich Hertz. The result? I don't know.,0
Animal Collective is a very  very good guess. 462241 likes on here and released the album  Centipede Hz .,0
Blur! Please add Blur to the line-up!,0
I think Peter just nailed it!,0
Arctic monkeys: album 2012 “are you mine? /electricity” Song ”crying lighting”  Lightning = electromagnetism = Heinrich Hertz,0
Arctic Monkeys  again?,0
I love it when you people go on and on about artists it couldn't possibly be (Arctic Monkeys and what not) when the most likely solution has already been found :),0
Animal Collective for reasons given above.,0
luke the Puke!!,0
solving this puzzle suppose to reveal the name of the artist that is gona be announced tomorrow or is it just something to keep our minds occupied :P?,0
This year festival for me will be the festival which offers Daft Punk. SO  DAFT PUNK!,0
Crying freemen perhaps... yet another electronic act...  hoping for Soundgarten  just need to work a little longer on that puzzle...,0
This is a pretty nice guess on the lineup http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ,0
The first picture (background) is a screenshot out of the horror movie  100 feet  http://www.aceshowbiz.com/still/00003898/100_feet06.html -> 100 feet --> centipede The right and embedded picture is obviously  a painting of Rudolf Hertz. --> Hz The latest album from Animal Collective (~462.000 Likes of FB) is called  Centipede Hz . --> Animal Collective  welcome to Roskilde Festival.,0
We absolutely LOVED watching your collaborative efforts in solving this teaser. We had no doubt you would - but in just 18 minutes! That's great work  everybody!  This photo has two elements: 1) Screen grab from the film  100 Feet   2) drawing of Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (whose name became the term used for electrical frequencies). The first element refers to 'Centipede' (which is Latin and translates to  100 Feet )  and the second to 'Hz'.  So we should make things harder the next time  huh?,0
This teaser was too hard. Next one should be easy :),0
Goddamn just announce daft punk!,0
You've already admitted on twitter that it's been figured out in this thread (guessing AnCo was pretty spot on...)  so get on with the bleeping announcement!!! ( ,0
Atli Þór Matthíasson  obviously NOT as it was guessed in 18 minutes.,0
People in here are fucking awesome! I had no idea at all - and yet it was solved in no time at all.,0
If you see it here  it means they're playing:  http://roskilde-festival.dk/music,0
85 000 free meals for people in need. This is what Danish organizations Det Runde Bord and Stop Spild Af Mad created out of 35 ton of leftover food from Roskilde Festival 2015. Well done to both organizations for fighting food waste and helping people in need.,31

As you said. Its a music festival. Im fine with it. My county is too crappy to take part anyways  ),0
When is very soon? ??,0
I hope the camping will open very early on june 25 next year. The Reason is there lot of people at Copenhell festival that day in Copenhagen and my plan next year is going to Copenhell and Roskilde of course :),0

(Yes  another one  sorry!) I bought my ticket without any hestitation this year in the memory of watching the World Cup in 2010 in Roskilde - it was awesome! Not showing the World Cup this year will only make a lot of your guests miss even more of the great music as it forces us to move into town  which takes sooo long - and it's not half the experience! The mix of the Roskilde atmosphere  amazing music and World Cup is nothing short of legendary  so  please  Roskilde: reconsider this decision  this horrible decision for you as well as your guests! The following video clip with drunk Dutch WC-guys from 2010 shows pretty well what many of us have been looking forward to :-),1
Bugger the world cup.....I'd rather shove rusty 5  nails up my nose...coz I watch a mans game ....RUGBY !,0
Good for you :-),0
It sucks for football fans  we know. But have a look at the matches from Thursday through Sunday. That's roughly from 18:00 until midnight. We don't want to book all kinds of good music and then lure everybody away by showing football at the same time. Same deal in the warm-up days.,0
Sorry Roskilde Festival  but this argument simply sucks. There is not all that much music Monday and Tuesday  and honestly  I doubt people would turn down class acts to watch a football match. If you had confidence in your bookings  you would show both. Not showing football simply says to me that you are afraid that the acts are not good enough to win over potential football-goers. And again  130.000 people - even if 10.000 watched football  it would still leave 120.000 listening to music..,0
Roskilde Festival is not about sitting in front of a screen watching soccer! it's about being outside experiencing new things  making new friends and  for me  about getting away from society for a while.. If you wanna watch soccer  stream it on your tablet or simply keep yourself updated on the results on any news site,0
Simon  we didn't expect you - or any football fan - to like the argument. We can't give you football  but we can give you lots of music.,0
Thomas Skelly  we've given you a pretty solid argument. You just don't like it because you want to watch the world cup.,0
So on sunday the 30th and on monday the 1st (1/8-finals) you got 8 bands from 18:00  that almost no-one knows and I imagine the football-segment  would probably not go see that much. Why not show just the 1/8-finals? You probably have a big screen at Skate already. This should be the easiest way of pleasing your audience  live up to your  More than music  slogan and make good PR by listening to the demand of the people. Right now you're in the middle of a social-media suicide.,0

Will there be any places in the naked race open to festival goers this year? I wanna represent Ireland in a frantic naked yet glorious run of madness. :-),0
You can sign up at the Festival Radio tent (during the festival). Ireland was represented in 2007  where Aoife Dineen won.   http://ekstrabladet.dk/flash/kultur/article186083.ece,0
Sweet. :) See how things go. I'll have to really up the training so. Cheers man.,0
Maybe when it gets a bit warmer Steen. Rachel ye won't be in Roskilde and I don't presume you read their papers either so ye won't have to see. If I post anything on Facebook it'll be sufficiently censored if I get in the race at all. :P Paula would you mind keeping an ear on the radio station so I know where to go and when? O:),0
The entry trials Steen. Ye can't just show up and enter  unfortunately.,0
My bad. Though I do recall the first year we were there when the radio station was in English they were mentioning trials going on somewhere. I suppose they'd tell me then. We'll see what happens. :-),0
What ever it takes. I'll give it my all. :P,0
You can still suggest charitable projects you think should receive a part of the profit from Roskilde Festival. Here are a few of the organisations that have been suggested already.   Make your suggestion via Your Donations right here before 7 September to have your say: http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/more/non-profit/your-donations,15
Hello I suggest you could donate money to the refugees stuck at the Islands of Greece. Educated people that had to run for their lives. Looking for safety  in different parts of Europe.,0
I might've missed it but will there be an official video of Kendrick's concert?,0
Unfortunately not. We don't have the rights to show that concert.,0
Cancel Slipknot  and bring us BOWIE. An eye for an eye!,0

How can i enter in contact with you guys about recommending an A-MA-ZING band/collective/initiative from Brazil?  There is this 10 year old band formed by students of the Rio de Janeiro Musical School that have everything to do with the festival! Globalized lyrics  quality music  interests into politics and a great attitude! They are worth a listen  and make sure the subtitles are in english.  You guys in the PR should definetely show this to the South American Curators! Its the same style as Metá Metá  that played this year in the Pavillion! (btw  thanks A LOT from bringing a little piece of goodness from home  was priceless to see them here!)  ,0
Hi Yuri. You will soon be able to recommend bands for #RF16. Just stay tuned and keep an eye on our Facebook-page.,0
Aaaand we have a winner!  Congrats to Vegard S. Kristiansen whose photo was voted as the very best one from #rf15 among our festival-goers.  Also  congrats to Barbara Linnea Peters and Rikke Sørlie Langø who have won a ticket each to Roskilde 2016. Have a look in your inboxes (presumably in the 'other' folder).,16
Nice. Tuborg must be very happy :-),0
How did he jump 10 feet high,0
whaaaaat? It's a good picture  but the Alien&cow and Bob Hund was just better!,0
When can we vote acts for next year at your homepage :) ?,0
It won't be long  Atli. Who are you voting for this year?,0
So the big guns... Not a big shock really  -),0
Hehe Iron Maiden will tour europe next summer :),0
Meet By the Lake Festival. A brand new Danish/German festival that took place in Berlin this weekend. The By the Lake-organisation wants to develop new cultural projects - this weekend's festival being one of them.   We're very happy to support their work with a donation of 15 000 Euro.,3
15 000 Is that enough,0
Is it a fraud? (99% of me knows it is ... but!),0
Hi Roskilde. Some webpage called Icestreet.net. has just revealed some new artists for your lineup this summer? I don't know if they're credible  however. Can you confirm it? ,0
Hey RoskildeFestival  just saw this http://icestreet.net/roskilde-afslorer-2013-program/ is this true? - i see names that are not on your website. (http://roskilde-festival.dk/music/bands/),0
Good news  the gravel pit at our campsite has been FILLED UP again!  The area just south of the Pavilion stage will be used for a new zone in 2013. Read more here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/2013-will-be-a-ladder-towards-climax/  The rest of the what-used-to-be-a-gaping-hole needs time to settle - so we won't be able to use it in 2013. But in 2014 Camping East will look like it did 15 years ago. Imagine that!,69

Happy birthday to the wonderful Florence Welch.   A perfect day to let your mind wander back to the incredible Florence + The Machine show at #RF15.  Photo: Headshot.be,16
Yeah its just the quaterfinals anyways. Who has time to waste on football on a festival?,0
We've got some amazing art for you at #RF14:   zetland has revolutionized journalism and turned it into an art form and from Thursday – Sunday during the festival you will be able to enjoy their live shows in Art Zone with a line-up of musicians and artists from Roskilde Festival 2014.  Get ready for intense  interactive and involving performance art by Lilibeth Cuenca Rasmussen (DK)  Savage Amusement (AUS/DE)  Sisters Hope (DK) and Katalin Halasz (UK) who will without a doubt sharpen your senses!  And explore MASER ART's large maze. Experience it and document it on social media – and the work of art will change as the work is posted and re-posted online.,8
I can recommend Sisters Hope to anyone who is creative  intuitive  poetic or sensitive. It's a beautiful experience.,0
Sorry  no. One-day tickets are only for the final four music days.,0
Bunny  Ball-BALL!! Roskilde  please. You cannot be serious about not showing the World Cup. Regardless of expenses  it IS tradition  you dont mess with tradition  it will bite you sorely  think of the beer sales  the children and people whipping out of the festival to catch the games. Just put up smaller screens away from the music. You cannot deny us this option  it is very un-Roskilde. It is part of that Orange Feeling  gorrammit!,0
And me,0
It sucks for football fans  we know. But have a look at the matches from Thursday through Sunday. That's roughly from 18:00 until midnight. We don't want to book all kinds of good music and then lure everybody away by showing football at the same time. Same deal in the warm-up days.,0
It is not that I find your decision  stupid  or  arrogant . I expect all capable party people (those who dont need the break) to find themselves at the music during the games  it is the fact that you decidedly leave us with no choice. Have a walk around when the music is playing - those of you with years of experience realise that not everyone is up facing the music  you know this! It aint Orange  baby. Anyways  I was furious last night. Today I am serene again and looking forward to another kick ass year. One love.,0
The Roskilde-goers are doing creative countdown pics over at Instagram.  Best daily picture wins beer.  Follow link for rules: http://instagram.com/p/pBPCVIFeYy/,14
Simon Olrik  says a little about your imagination  huh?,0
Who has taken the best photo? 'Like' your favourite(s) and enter the draw for 2x1 tickets to Roskilde Festival 2016. Deadline: Monday 31 August 12:00 CET.,22
My best photo. Can I summit here?,0
We've passed the submission deadline  sorry.  Now it's all about voting.,0
Roskilde Festival could adopt this idea  particularly for along the fences leading up to the festival site!,0
Who would you like Roskilde Festival to support?  Roskilde Festival makes a profit because of your participation  and we want you to suggest charitable projects to receive a part of the profit from this year's festival.  With Your Donations  we want you to be part of the decision-making in terms of donations. Therefore  we want you to suggest charitable projects to receive a part of the profit from Roskilde Festival. You might know someone who is starting up a project  or maybe you have volunteered for an organisation that you think deserves a donation from Roskilde Festival? Let us know!  Last year we received suggestions for more than 300 projects and donated 500 000 DKK to charities you recommended!  Photo: Jacques Holst,41

Una Cecilia Marquard-Busk is on it! :D,0
2 things.   First for the love of god stop asking for the new app. That question has been answered at least 20 times already. The app will be ready when its ready. You wont need until the festival begins anyways.  Second. Everybody has known since forever that there is a football world championship during the festival. If you love football so much then why did you even buy a ticket? Its a music festival not a sporting event.   Thank you very much.,0
Heey! I am travelling from Netherlands to Roskilde all by myself with my fathers car. I am from Norway but my father lives in Netherlands. I am working here all summer and that is why I have to travel from here and meet my friends at the festival. I am not sure how much the trip will cost me but was thinking about splitting between myself and fellow passengers. If you like loud music and crazy roadtrips you should contact me.,0
anyone need a ride from Netherlands to roskilde festival? I am travelling all by myself and have 2 seats available if somebody is interested.,0
Absolutely. We're putting the final touches on it right now.,0
Grey? That's a bit sad... Please tell me that there's going to be some more caps like these... but not grey. ,0
Because grey is the new orange :D,0
So  someone told me that you guys aren't showing the World Cup at any screens at all this year. Someone tell me that this is a damn lie? That some of us don't have to travel back to Copenhagen for the games? Please tell me that?,0
You will need to travel. But only to Roskilde.,0
What is the meaning of this? Everybody loved meeting at the skating park for late night football. It's completely ridiculous. We'll miss so much music. A disgrace is what it is.,0
You are fucking it all up + underestimating the amount of football fans at Roskilde. Now you're gonna have people shuffling back and forth between the festival area and Roskilde + opening the option for others to leech on the festival by making an open air showing. Remember Love Camp?,0
This is too bad. Roskilde Festival solve this. Capitalize on it instead  make a sports bar with screens and matches = earning more money  instead selvfedme (danish word for having enough in yourself) obviously rules..,0
Football fans are obviously stupid  primitive  non-cultural  fighting thugs not good enough for the hip crowd at Roskilde Festival.  This is such a no-win cause. Incredibly stupid. I suppose we'll just miss half the festival then. Thanks a lot  Roskilde.,0
The screens are apparently to expensive. Get Carlsberg to sponsor them or something?,0
This must be voiced in unison. An argument like  we deemed our guests´demand for football inequal to spending money on servicing the lesser crowd  is utter and complete horseshit and only speaks of the newbie generation of arrangers´ inability to respect tradition. It is a disgrace  Roskilde. A c'thorough and total fuck up.,0

We're not far from sold out  so do get a move on it :-),0
Aah thanks :) i'll get my move on! ??,0
Get your shit together and get Snoop Lion for the festival! i know you are eager to present your hipster music  but for the love of god! get Snoop Lion!,0
Easy now  Lars. Go get yourself a cup of coffee and enjoy your Monday.,0
It's a bit too early to go into specifics on this matter. Keep an eye on our website later in the year.,0

As fake as fake can ever be.,0
I find this on Roskilde forum yesterday,0
http://icestreet.net/roskilde-afslorer-2013-program/ is this serious??? its fucking insane,0

It's as FAKE as it's gonna get. Nice work with the graphics  though.,0

How about the many rumors about Daft Punk playing Orange? I gotta know!!!,0
According to an article  that im trying to find again  Daft Punk will play at Glastonbury and Roskilde this year :-),0
http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/daft-punk-to-play-glastonbury-2013   According to US based blog  EDMSnob  Daft Punk will hit the road next summer taking in Denmark's Roskilde festival  Glastonbury  Sweden's Peace and Love festival and Oya Festival in Norway. ,0
Roskilde Festival  I think you are great even though you're not showing any world cup matches,0
Queen just posted this photo. The shinny stage we see in the bottom  do you know anything about it? It's from a concert in Hyde Park  London in 1976? Wild guess  is it THE Orange Stage?,1
It is in fact the old Orange Stage  originally owned by The Rolling Stones  yes.,0
This have maybe been answered before  but. If I have an entrance booking ticket  and the entrance  waiting arena opens at 16:00 on Saturday. do I have to stay over night in the cue until you let people in at 18:00 Sunday? or do you let people in on Saturday?,0
Answered before  scroll down,0
The waiting area opens Saturday  but the campsite doesn't open until Sunday.,0

Dänmark Scream For Me 2013!   ,0
Very soon. In fact  you'll get a brand-new app.,0
It's not quite the same product  but it's also a matter of general price increases.,0
Once you've claimed your spot  you decide when you put up tents there. They are handed out on a first-come-first-served basis  but of course you're guaranteed a spot when you have bought one.  If you've bought a Get a Place spot  you'll soon receive a mail with more info.,0
Liars and Les Big Byrd are the two final acts for the #rf14 line-up.   We've also made a few minor adjustments in the band schedule.  See updated schedule: http://po.st/RF14schedule Buy ticket: http://po.st/RF14ticket,1
Hey! Please Update your Mobile app ??,0
If I could make a suggestion  it would be to NOT make schedule changes after releasing it. After looking at the schedule I had a wonderful Sunday afternoon planned of going to Moderat  then 1 hour of Horrors  and then 1 hour of Stevie Wonder. Then you decided to change that because so many people had a cry over Stevie Wonder and MØ clashing. Me and many others were very hurt by this change and losing out on Moderat  which I suppose you've now decided to try and rectify by moving up Stevie Wonders time-slot. Obviously this now makes it impossible to get see Stevie Wonder and Horrors and see a decent amount of either show.  I'd just like to say that people will always complain about clashes in line-ups  but they'll get over it. It's annoying for the rest of us who have made plans looking at the schedule  only to be burned afterwords.,0
So no reggae? Wtf!,0
Atmosphere  Grieves and budo  Wiz kahlifa  Oncue.,0
Hi Roskilde Festival  I had an accident at last years Roskilde Festival and had to leave right after The Cure finished their set. I'm going for round 2 this year and I'd love to see RetRoBot (an uprising  magical band from Iceland)  play. Do a poor  broken fellow a favor  get RetRoBot! :** <3,0

Thats just mean,0
Yeah  booking RATM was basically relevant in 2008 and 2009  maybe even 2010 if you are stretching it. But booking them in 2013? Way to be behind trends :D,0
please bring them to Roskilde 2013!,0
Enough times. Get System of a Down!!,0
Wow  win everything!!! Thats a lot  of prizes!!!,0
I'm grasping on to the smallest of hopes here  but i really really hope  that this is some kind of secret clue... By the end of 2013 it could be 2 times...,0
or 3,0
isnt it 2 times once in 1996 too? or is the Roskilde wikipedia page wrong?,0
Petteri Pertola  I hope you'll find a festival with Justin Bieber and Psy. Good luck with your new-trend seeking.  2 time  in 1994 and 1996. It would be good to have them back!,0
RAGE shall play at roskilde again i hope ....,0
Roskilde does not simply mention RATM without getting everyone's hopes up,0
2  But hopefully 3 soon!,0
@RF if you don't book RATM after years and years of public debate about them  and then finish off a big contest with RATM  you are just a mean bully  taunting an audience in despair...,0
Marcus  haha  apparently not. But let's repeat: This has nothing to do with the 2013 lineup.,0
1994 and 1996,0
 Not enough  is the right answer :),0
too few  -) !,0
You fooled me there Roskilde.. dont you post something like that ever again.,0
Probably the youngest festivalguest ever  ) And she will be back next year :),0

Hey Roskilde!  So i have a ticket for the festival without entrance booking  can i use a entrancebooking that someone else bought or do i need one with my own name on? :),0
You can easily use an entrance booking that someone else has bought. They are not personal,0
Thank you! I will then :),0

Keep a proper tone  Mathias.  We will not screen the World Cup this year.,0
They see him scrollin'  they hatin'  patrollin'  tryna catch him writin' dirty.,0
@Roskilde Festival - What is your motivation/reason for NOT showing the World Cup-matches this year?,0
Hi Roskilde. When do you release the full/final festival map? - Kind Regards Camp Chuck.  ),0
Hurry up! :D,0
You can't possibly imagine how much we're hurrying at the moment. But it's more important getting things right than fast :-),0
I know.  ) Just can't wait you know! :),0
That depends on your size. The measurements are in the link below.  http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent/,0
It is not possible to press the links next to the text to see the sketch (look at the attached picture). Is there another way to see the sketches of the tents? Because there's no measurements of the cabins in the MEDIUM tents on the page.,0
Very bad decision not to screen the World Cup 2014 at Roskilde Festival'14. I don't buy the reason for it  either. There were no nordic teams playing in WC'10 or Euro'12 at the same time as the festival. That didn't stop the festival from enriching their audience with big screen football. Reconsider  please! ,0

Hello! Please tell me  what is this onsale thing? It says the onsale ends today  6th of June. What does this mean? Will the tickets get more expensive? Thank you!,0
You may have come across a special offer for Swedes (your name doesn't look Swedish  though)  offering free transportation from Malmö and back again if you bought your ticket today (and only today).  The ticket price remains the same for everyone.  If you are in fact considering attending Roskilde Festival  don't wait too long. We're selling lots of tickets at the moment  and before long we will be sold out.,0
Tickets are not personal  so it's definitely possible for one person to show up and get three tents. Just remember that you need to be there early to get tents next to each other.  If you're 65 or older you can get in for free on the final Sunday. Just bring photo ID.,0
Thank you! What about my kid  4 years old. On sunday. Is it free  or what's the price for kids? He needs to see mr. Stevie Wonder!,0
You should head for http://beta.roskilde-festival.dk and use the feature there. Then your favourites will be in our soon-to-be-launched app as well.,0
Congrats on your National Day  Sweden!  If you buy your ticket today (and today only) we throw in FREE transportation from Malmö directly to Roskilde Festival 2014 and back again.  More info: http://po.st/RF14FreeTransport,12
I just booked my ticket today without noticing this option  is there a way to still get the free bus (since i did book it today) or am I screwed?,0
We always miss the good stuff by 37 minutes. Noooooo! Robert Wiesner,0
The 3rd July is not a wednesday..its a thursday..so what day does the bus depart? Confused:/,0
Yeah I bought one but your link here confused me to think that I would arrive Wednesday.. But the ticket says the 3rd so I guess that's Thursday then.. :/,0
'Normal' access through that entrance is a few hours later.,0

Mmm  so my friend is supposed to buy a ticket for me and for himself. But  he's drunk and not near a computer. Please tell me we can buy them tomorrow  or I'll jump out from 4h floor.,0
Is there gonna be anymore entrance bookings for West put out for sales?,0
I have a get-a-tent central ticket already but can I arrive earlier an stay att the regular camping in a friends tent and later move in to my tent att the central camping?,0
We'll be ariving late sunday  so my question  is  can you enter the campsite at any time  day/night?,0
Can you confirm that there are still tickets for sale? I can't press the  look for tickets  button on the ordering page.,0
So are there still few tickets left? Or is it less than few now?,0
Paul Mauring look here brah,0
How much does one day ticket cost ?,0
Hello  Roskilde! I would like to know whether I can take your offer with the free transportation from Malmo airport (the one that comes with the ticket)  and use it on the 28th of June  which is my arrival date.,0
The busses will only drive at the specified times. But if you want you can still take the bus home,0

Thanks for an amazing festival! #HeroesOfRoskilde the movie is out! ,0
Dear organizers   the first time i went to Roskilde festival i got drugged. It was during my 'sober day' and after drinking only one beer i had a sudden and weird memory loss for about 6-7 hours where I remember absolutely nothing. Luckily I am pretty sure I did not get raped  though 4 years later I still cant be certain. I still love the festival and ended up returning several times  and since I know that Roskilde is a very conscious festival that cares a lot about the safety and well being for us festival-goers  I figure that it would be of big interest for You as well to spread more knowledge about the important issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment that is present on all festivals.  Below is an article from Vice  some ideas they have  for example the 'Reclaim the night' stall they're talking about  seems to make a lot of sense. Please consider  because I know that me as well as many others would be thrilled to see this sort of engagement  an it would generally contribute to a better  happier  safer festival for all of us. Thank You for Your time  and thank You for years of amazing festivals!,0
Can I use the Volt recharging service this year if i bring the Volt thing from last year?,0

Everyone is talking about her. Jimmy Kimmel calls her MOO  and her iconic top-of-the-head braid has been widely adopted by fans.

Sounds good - but what is the ordinary price for this set? Or for the 24-pk Tuborg beer?,0
BilletNET sure is a bad platform for selling anything  in particular products that aren't event-tickets. Constant usability challenges  logical inconsistencies and just general confusion. Even someone as myself who is an internet professional is struggling to get through the checkout-flow. It took almost 10 minutes  which is completely unacceptable for any eCommerce transaction.   I would seriously consider using a platform more suitable for selling products - the cost for switching platform should be covered by the reduction of drop-off you will see.,0

We're all winners at Valhall  drink up and sing!,0
It's probably not gonna happen. If LiveNation  Green Day's agency who are putting on the show at Refshaleøen  allowed that  it would completely sabotage their ticket sales for the single gig. A slim chance could be if the Refshaleøen gig sells out REALLY fast. The band could then agree to do an extra gig in Denmark  either a single gig or  a festival gig at Roskilde. Otherwise  don't count on it.,0

Okay  thanks for the answer. I'm just so exited and can't wait - i'm sorry. :D,0
EDIT: THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR INTEREST. WE HAVE FOUND ALL THE HELP WE NEEDED (YOU HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED DIRECTLY) PLUS WE HAVE A HUGE STAND-BY LIST IN CASE SOMEBODY HAS TO CANCEL.  Want to reserve a spot for your camp? Help us out and we’ll help you out.  We’re looking for about 40 Roskilde-goers to help us set up some fence for our waiting areas at the entrances. We need you Saturday 21 June and Sunday 22 June - both days from around 10:00.  Interested? Send an e-mail to daniel.kristensen@roskilde-festival.dk with names of all helpers. You need to be at least 5 people. First come  first served.  Photo: Mia Dernoff,109
Hi! Is there anyone  or maybe someone from Roskilde  who know where it will be possible to watch the world cup during Roskilde Festival??,0

Yes  there's only one West entrance this year. The entrance booking map shows the waiting areas which is the only relevant thing for entrance booking. The other map (probably this one you're thinking of? http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf.pdf) shows the entrances from which you can enter a few hours later and get your temporary wristband exchanged for a real one. But that map is not finished yet.,0
Hello Roskilde festival. How are you going to cover the world cup at this years festival?? :),0
They are not,0
They should,0
No World cup this year...,0
Rojs Hussein  We will not not screen the World Cup. We have chosen not to because no Nordic countries have qualified  and none of the most important matches are played during Roskilde 2014.,0
Anyone got any Info on the great Beer vouchers they had last year ?,0
No info yet. But we'll soon have more news on this.,0
Here you go: http://goo.gl/CF2W3v,0
Thank you!,0
Right  Roskilde really doesn't make sense  -)  Entrance booking is on a 'first come  first served' basis. You've had one month to make a booking. Moreover  if someone chooses another entrance  West might be available again.,0

 A little bonus: This reshuffle actually leaves some extra space in the schedule. Now we have not just one but two vacant slots on the Avalon stage. We are working on filling them out as soon as possible.   Please  please  please The Teddybears!,0
Other silly question : If we buy two tickets  the two tickets will be on my name even though only one is obviously for me  nevermind ?  Thanks guys ..!,0
I'm freaking out  'cus I can't 'Look for tickets' on the website. Please calm me down by telling me that there are tickets left.,0
We recommend tuning in here tomorrow:  http://www.dr.dk/P6Beat/,5
The Raveonettes?,0
Numbers on top  march the 19th  is a distraction. It's a tuesday and Justin Bieber will play in Paris. Never mind that  listen to the radio on Saturdays  get stoned and imagine colours raising from the city. Go to Denmark and meet colourful people at the Festival.,0

How can i get a ticket to thursday 3rd july?,0
Hey! How early can you enter the camping if you have a one day ticket for thursday? And is there a certain entrance you get your one day bracelet?,0
A one-day ticket is valid from 5:00 (in the morning) until 5:00 (in the morning the following day). Just head for any entrance  and they will exchange your ticket to a wristband.,0
The Boss joined The Rolling Stones on stage in Lisboa. Can't promise anything like it at #rf14 - but let's cross some fingers.,80
The Boss Rules!,0
The Boss is the Boss - lets cross all our fingers ??,0
That would be AWESOME!!,0
He might be known as  The Boss   but The Stones are in another league  imo. So I would love it if he didn't partake. I mean they just don't seem that good a fit. Let the British rock be British.,0
Rachel Smyth all dons x,0
Hands very xed! :),0
Stuart Wilson that would be amaze balls !!!!!,0
ha yes lets keep fingers crossed   although the changes are limited  -)  since Bruce Springsteen with his wife Patti (E Street Band / back up singer) is often in Lisbon  visiting  their daughter  Jessica who is living / studying there ... but ...we never know  -),0
Edoardo Mischa Allan imagine if they played Ain't Good Enough For You- we can dream!,0

If they're all gone  they're all gone. It's only if someone should choose another entrance that his/her entrance booking will become available again.  So you should pick another entrance or just be patient a few hours  then entrance booking isn't needed anymore.,0
We've rounded 250 000 Facebook friends.  To celebrate this we're donating DKK 250 000 (approx. EUR 35 000) to Danish Refugee Council's Youth Network.  This donation is possible because of all Roskilde-goers. We're 100 % non-profit. Here you can party and make the world a better place at the same time.,76
I am going this year. Everybody who's with me make a commen. WOOHOO!!!,0
Thank you so much  Roskilde Festival. Your generous donation means the world to us. With this we're able to give young refugees living in Denmark an experience of a lifetime that they otherwise wouldn't get - just like you give experiences to people every year. We <3 Roskilde!,0
I just threw up a bit there. Similar to an acute allergic reaction to beer bongs. Cheers.,0
The final sentence illustrates to me the perfect reason to go to Roskilde - I have had my faith in humanity restored.,0
Well  as someone coming from germany´s Saarland  you were so that much convincing  that we married in Roskilde. Keep the spirit  Check it out Roskilde. Don´t feel safe! We will be there   as sooner as you think!!!! :-),0

Well I believe they've been selling entrance tickets for about a month so yes they are probably sold out,0
It seems they're all gone  yes. It's only if someone should choose another entrance that his/her entrance booking will become available again.  So you should pick another entrance or just be patient a few hours  then entrance booking isn't needed anymore.,0

Join us on a journey through the music of Roskilde Festival 2014!  Fans  bands and bookers explore the line-up in a series of five videos. ,17
Nice. When will the last four be released?,0
Haven't you booked any good music for the Gloria stage? Or why is it not mentioned?  -),0
Your bookers should learn about hiphop and metal. Only 2-5% women? HAHA.,0
Hi Jesper  sorry. We misunderstood your question. You're absolutely right. There are four more videos. They will be released the four following Wednesdays.,0
Samina  wehave four more videos coming up that will take you through the line-up. Something about Gloria as well.,0
PLEASE bring back Nils Frahm! Amazing concert back in 12 :) i love this years lineup btw.. best ever!,0
Well  teach us  then :-P,0
So you solve the problem by working in the structure that is created? Female acts in hip hop and metal are not getting much space from most (male) journalists and their medias etc. but there are many. Many that are rising these days in an otherwise quite fucked up society. And I think its the bookers for one of the biggest festivals in Europe to find them and give them space. Otherwise the low percent you talk about will be true.,0
Specially in hip hop you find many rising female acts. Fuse writes about it for example: http://www.fuse.tv/2014/04/rising-female-rappers,0

Hey Roskilde Festival.  I've heard rumours that Google Play Music is finally being released in Denmark today  so I thought I'd share a playlist for Roskilde Festival 2014 with you. Still work in progress  but I promise to work on it all day.  ,0
The map is ready soon. We're working on it. Here's a early version: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf.pdf,0

Have you answered everyone that applied for a volunteer job this year ? :),0

Will you screen somewhere in the camping-area the World Cup games taking place during the festival  like you did with the European Championship in 12?,0
Sorry  no. We will not screen any matches from the World Cup.,0
Why not?,0
Probably because of the copyright issue. Bars pay alot of money to show the matches to maby 100 people. I can't imagine it will be cheap to show it to 10.000...,0
Its a music festival. You can watch football at home.,0
Because Denmark didn't qualified.,0
The main reason is that none of the Scandinavian countries are part of the World Cup  and none of the most important matches are played during the festival. And add to that it's expensive.,0

If you've attended the festival for many years  you know that this isn't the first year we 're making changes in the schedule. We've done so many times. And we don't do it for fun. We spend SO much time up to the final release  carefully making sure that every single artist is actually in the country  ready to play  when they're supposed to be. And even AFTER that  we're asked to do changes.  In this case we've received some requests from the artists (can't go into details with the specifics atm...)  so it's never easy with these things. On top of that  seeing the many voices asking us to change one specific clash spurred us on to find another solution. But it wasn't solely because of this. We don't  just  change something because of 'popular demand' alone.  But of course we try to make the best schedule for everyone. It's not an easy job.,0

Hi Roskilde  Is there going to be a similar offer like the one last year with the beer voucher for a case of beer + 8 additional PR beers?,0
We'll offer something like it very soon,0
You can sign up until Wednesday at the festival (2 July). But we recommend that you sign up 28 June at the latest.,0
We'll make a brand new app  but if you have the old one installed it will come as an update. We don't have a release date yet  but it will be available a couple of weeks before the festival,0
We’ve made a few changes in the schedule: MØ and Moderat switch places  and Future Islands are playing a later slot.  More info: http://po.st/ScheduleChanges  Download schedule: http://po.st/RF14schedule,37
Where is Future Islands?,0
Good then i can see Future Islands also,0
Thats just sad :(,0
Fuck this I wanted to see nails and moderat,0
What's the reason for the MØ-Moderat-switch?,0
No you guys... Moderat and Stevie Wonder at the same time.. Really? :'( Dillema...,0
Insert  Slowdive(band) on one of the empty slots in Avalon!!! They even have a song called Avalon so that is perfect!,0
Future Islands and Trentemøller at the same time... :(,0
Omg Future Islands clashing with Atomic Bomb band now. Was so happy with the schedule  now I have some serious thinking to do. 2 concerts I really really don't want to miss... DAMMIT ROSKILDE ! :/,0
The Kissaway Trail could maybe fill in one of the vacant  times   -),0
Wish you had removed the Spids Nøgenhat/Arctic Monkeys clash as well. By far the worst clash for me this year :-(,0
Did you consult anyone other than the people complaining about MØ/SW?  Point of criticism - Moderat and SW play at the same time.,0
Wow  so now I have to choose between Moderat and Stevie Wonder ... You keep disappointing me  Roskilde ...,0
Perfect!!! Thank you!,0
Could you perhaps spread tuesday's hip hop over the week? I want to watch Earl Sweatshirt and Outkast  but I can't see them both.,0
Get rid of the stones and put nails on the orange stage,0
Any chance you could put electric wizard on half an hour earlier so they don't clash with Outkast?,0
I thought it was bad that Future Islands played daytime  but now they crashing with Trentemøller!? :( Two hard choices that day - Darkside or Mogwai  and Future Islands or Trentemøller. Even Deftones playing so tight with Damon Albanr is sad. But still friday is a better schedule day than saturday - that is the worst crash day in my life.,0
Are you fucking shitting me,0
Hey RF  Since you ignored my last question  I'll give it another go:  Is the clash of Stevie Wonder and Moderat solely based on complaints from people who want to watch MØ and Stevie Wonder?  If so - how can you defend that sort of preferential treatment?,0
Can see you're looking for a couple of acts to fill the holes: Why not call Ry Cooder and some of his friends? He can't afford touring in Europe anymore  but I'm sure he'll some gladly  if you pay the trip,0
How about RL Grime playing saturday or later Sunday?,0
From a near perfect schedule to an overlap with 2 of my top 5 must see acts =(,0
Thank you for the response.  I recognize that you're doing a difficult job  and I commend you for doing it as well as you do. I <3 Roskilde and your work has been a big part of growing that <3  However - On this occasion your consideration for the MØ-fans wishes seems unbalanced.  If you had made your considerations about rescheduling public  I am sure you would have also heard from the people who wish to see both Moderat and SW.  I am neither sufficiently capable nor willing to bear the responsibilities you bear.  None the less it is self evident  that you cannot  make the best schedule for everyone  by listening to the wishes of a select crowd  whilst ignoring another.  Since you are unwilling/unable to reveal what requests you received from the artists  that argument is void.  What format should a complaint take for you to consider unf*#%ing this situation?,0
Moderat at the same time as Stevie Wonder?! That's so messed up. Really really sad and annoying. I hope you're gonna change that.,0
When will you be announcing the one unannounced band playing thursday at 19:00?,0
Put in  blue machines  in the new hole!,0
Great. Just went from no conflict to conflict. I now have to choose between Classixx  Future Islands and Trentemøller. Well  I guess you can't make everyone happy.,0
Pls no!!!,0
Fly in The Black Keys thursday after their concert in Poland - PLEASE!!! :-),0
When you now have an open spot on Avalon  then please call The Danish rap artist Per Vers right away.,0
Can you put Damon on not-Arena too?,0
Also.. You forgot to move Albarn to the Orange Stage. It's the world's stupidest idea to have him playing at Arena.. No one else in particulear is playing around the time he's gonna play.. Everybody is gonna go to the Arena Stage. He is the only Headliner who aren't playing Orange.  Also.. I haven't heard Mø's music at all.. But she seems to be the hottest in Danish music right now. She deserved to open Orange at Thursday.  This is the last time you'll ever book any band outside of scandinavia to open orange stage..  A tradition is a tradition  in which Roskilde is all about! Why not paint the Canopy blue next year.. That's how crazy I think this is!  And please don't reply to this comment with a lameass excuse that Outcast has a big set-up. That's just a very lame excuse.,0
I know this is a long shot  but any chance of pushing the Moderat concert just half an hour (to 21.30)? That way I'll be able to catch almost an hour of Stevie Wonder before making my way towards Arena? If not  I'll probably have to skip Moderat entirely  which would make me sad :(,0
Noo don't make me choose between Moderat and Stevie! It's bad enough that Diplo will also play at that time so I'll have to skip him as well..  And Future Islands same time as Trentemøller?? Argh...,0
How about moving RL Grime from sunday 14.30? This is not trying to be another annoying complaint  but why the most cozy time at the festival for such a trap-party? :/,0
Yes. They'll be available very soon,0
yeeees! :D,0
Are these allowed on roskilde? - 0.5 kg ,0

Check out the video of the graffiti project at the Grand Stand by DAIS.    This is my 24th year at Roskilde Festival. I keep coming back year after year. I think it's very unique that 130.000 people can spend a week together in pretty hard surroundings- but still you find nothing but happy and caring people here. The painting is an attempt to say 'Thank You' to Roskilde Festival for this special week once a year. And an attempt to remind us all  how great an effect Roskilde Festival has on all of us.   - DAIS,45

Are you guys putting up the foxygen show? Snälla,0
None of the shows on the smaller stages besides Arena and Orange were recorded. Also  Foxygen had really bad sound  so it might not have been super great in recorded form anyway.,0

Deltron 3030 are Dan the Automator  Del tha Funky Homosapien and Kid Koala (all three also performed on Gorillaz' first album  so it should sound pretty familiar).

You speak in code  young R2D2.  If you're talking about an age limit  Roskilde says in the practical folder  that you have to be 15 to attend the festival  on your own  without adult supervision. You will not be able to buy alcohol though  until you turn 18.,0

Makes you wonder: How much does the tattooist charge for doing a line marking a year?,0
Because it's so awesome  I would do it for free!,0
Think there normally is a minimun fee of about 500 DKK  but for a small line marking like that your tattoo artist might be talked into doing for a lot less  ) Especially if he attends the festival as well!,0
Well... I like it but i have seen it before.. there is a man working as a volontier He has a similar canopy tatoo on his arm and below itthere is a time stamp which states: 1972-?,0
Me and my sister got them to but in orange (of course)  ),0
When i reach 15 years (next year  ) i will do something like this too!,0
I have one with 18 lines  my younger brother have 7 on his tatoo and a friend from our camp has a tatoo as well jus dont remember how many years he has been with us,0
got the tent myself and since this will be my 10 year i was wondering about getting the lines as well  but maybe i get the years insted,0

Will you be selling the beer tickets beforehand like you did last year?,0
Roskilde  you need to make some good craft beer available  and not only industrial beer.....,0
I remember Tuborg launching T-Beer at Roskilde a few years ago. It was fucking foul.,0
We can still get ordinary beer  right?,0
Will you be able to pre-order beer this year  and get a voucher like last year?,0
Hey  I'd like to know what  the beer voucher was about last year?,0
No thank you,0
Fredrik Fleischer  absolutely. More info on that soon!,0

Peter James Andrews  this isn't by any means a  low-flavoured  beer like the one you mention. Give it a chance :-),0
Sara Brøndby Feltendahl  and do notice that we're serving in 0.5 litre cups - you don't see that much more (most places have gone down to 0.4).,0
Emanuel Andersson  indeed you will! More on that soon...,0
Simon Blixenkrone  this doesn't affect the price on regular Tuborg beer.,0
Vincent Bonom  we had a nice-price pre-sale of beer before Roskilde 2013. You buy online  get a voucher and pick up your cold beer at the festival. It was very popular  so we're doing it again soon.,0
Robert Giessler  well  ok then...,0

Hey Roskilde Festival! I wondered if any of the tents  mattresses etc. are donated if left in the camping areas? I left my tent and my matress (which were completely fine - I didn't even use either) because I thought it would be donated  but afterwards I noticed that there were places where you could go donate your stuff... So  have my tent and matress just been thrown out  or...?,0
Hi Vanessa  We try to gather as much as possible for recycling - but mainly the stuff that is handed in at Camp Aid.,0
Alright  thank you. :-),0
a little something about Roskilde...,0
Denmark's first store selling surplus food to open soon!   A lot of Roskilde-goers have already helped by buying shares in WeFood and they are only 100 000 DKK away from raising the 500 000 DKK needed. When they reach 500 000 DKK  Roskilde Festival will donate an additional 500 000 DKK to support the food waste project.   Help WeFood reach the target - buy a share and/or spread the word to your friends. Read more: http://hjlp.dk/Overskudsmad   All profits from the store will be used in Folkekirkens Nødhjælp's work amongst the poorest people in the World.    Thank you for making a difference!,84
Apart from your personal ticket (about DKK 2.000 -) you just need a caravan camping ticket. It was 500-something this year if I recall correctly. So about DKK 600 next year maybe?,0
4600 happy festival-goers was part of Clean Out Loud in Camping Area E at #RF15. This is what their camp site looked like Sunday afternoon after 8 days of partying. Way to go Clean Out Loud! Photo: SH Luftfoto,100
Shiiit if you compare to the G-area next to it  there's a huge difference. Would be nice if most of the campingsites looked like this afterwards.,0
Can you see your camp from here Gavin Francis Murray? Or were yis good boys who packed away all your stuff?,0
They didn't have a party...,0
It would be neat if clean and silent could be as that as well. It is by far the silent part I find most important though.,0
And this is how it looked like at Dream City after 8 days of partying ????????,0
John Carsing :-o,0
Aint Nuttin but a g thang,0
I just was thinking: how different the non-profit-result would look like if just everybody ...... :-) :-),0
The square like titles makes me want to play Sim City.,0
Years ago in the 90s  it was the  Green Test Camp  . Now again. Great.,0
We camped in N and tryed to ceep our campsite clean. But in 8 days we only got our garbage picked up once. I get sad every year when I see how some people just don't care. Fair enough we leave something behinde but no need to not give a fuck. Less clean-up more money for music and other great things??,0
People are really being nursed these days by the Roskilde Festival machine that offers all services you can think of during and even cleans up afterwards. Maybe it would be better for the sustainability image of Roskilde Festival if the participants would help out instead of leaving all the good deeds to the Roskilde Festival Organisation. Now that would be the true Orange Feeling  wouldnt it?,0
Did Birgitte Hjort Sorensen join you? :D,0
Christine Anna Dagmar we did it,0
Proud to be a part of the project of Clean Out Loud as a crew member and a student of Vallekilde Højskole <3,0
i had a fuckin great time first time in my life in Roskilde Festival,0
Respekt to Clear out loud.... !!!!!  Its a MAJOR problem that most People on the campsite dont care about keeping the areas clean. It must change!!,0
Compare with the piles of rubbish and shit at Glastonbury,0
Thats the Way ! Hopefully all camps Will look like this in the future ??,0
NOT in east 6 days later ??,0
Mere clean out Loud fremover!,0
Were*  ),0
RF could learn something from Burning Man's principle of  leave no trace  - pretty sure most people would support it if it was pushed enough.,0
Nice! Silent & clean would have looked like that too  if you'd marked all the entrances to J to let campers know what sort of behaviour that was expected from them in that area. Also  as others have pointed out  I noticed that the  messy  areas had lots of full garbage bags that were never collected  eventually broken and garbage spread out again.,0
I must admit that I've left quite a few of the blue Harald Nyborg tents at the Roskilde Festival in the past  but I've come to my senses. For this year I bought a really good tent  and I took it home for me to use on Roskilde festivals (and camping) in the future. :D  Also that picture pretty much sums up how the entire camping area should look after a festival. :),0
I enjoyed the festival  but was disgusted (last year) by the kids and their wallowing in their own shit.  At the food stands I saw some kid actually drop his garbage right next to a trash can.  Not sure where this comes from but it is unacceptable.  Is it a parental or societal failure?  Clean out loud is how most festival sites look after the party in the US. Maybe put out nearby big receptacles for garbage and try to shame these otherwise cool kids into behavior that is not quite as gross.,0
I think this is the future for the camp-sites!! Everyone cleans up their own mess!!!! #Wecandoit,0
That's an example of how it should be in all the other campsites. It's all about human behaviour...and constructive attitude!!,0
More clean out loud  please :),0
Wonderful First Aid Kit (SE) OFFICIAL returned to Roskilde Festival in 2015 and gave an amazing performance.   Here's one of many highlights from the concert.,30

I love them!! One of the best concerts this year! :),0
Amazing performance. They did an awesome version of Black Sabbath - War Pigs,0

If you actually have it in large sizes for tall big men like XXL or XXXL then I surely deserve it since it's so hard for me to get clothes! :),0
Trousers probably seen better days. To say they're on their last legs would be an understatement.,0
Andreas Schylanders bubblewrap jacket and pants didn't survive last years Roskilde. He needs new stuff.,0

Alright. Are you announcing it in advance?,0
Probably not. You can check off  get notifications  from our Facebook page if you want to make sure you'll see it in time.,0
I think it's a missed opportunity not to have Stevie Wonder as the closing act. Stevie Wonder would get EVERYONE to Orange Stage  metal-heads  hip-hop lovers and pop-girls. Drake  however  will not get everyone to the stage. Stevie Wonder would be the perfect closer  and honestly  I'm actually pretty disappointed. Guess I won't be going to the closing show.,0
Weeeeell  not everyone.,0
Of course not literally  but you get my point,0
Peter Brandsborg prefer Drake rather than Stevie,0
Im guessing that Stones wanted to play at 22 and Outkast did not want to play at 0100 so they had to put Outkast at 18.30 which in turn means there is no time for a small opening band on that stage. Pure speculation on my part though.,0
We know - it's no good. That's why we're working on a new one. Coming out in June.,0
Slipknot is ready to play Roskilde Festival 2013.  Here you can watch some GREAT footage from their last gig at Roskilde. It'll give you an idea of what's coming our way.,196

Metallica  AC/DC  Green Day and Blur :),0
Can you please book Linkin Park? :-),0
lol  today's quiz... knowing roskilde  this could be anything... ,0
Hey Roskilde. It's very nice that you put up playlists  but one small request. You're usually advocating good music quality. Could you please stop using remastered songs  if possible. They are usually an attempt to kill dynamic range in the music. Dynamic range is the new loud! I think it would make a big difference  if you started advocating that.,0
Hi. We are a group of friends how would like to live together at get a tent east. If one person books all the tents will we ten be placed together?,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOJf0pPNxe8  ''It's actually 12.6    [sic] 6 around the ceiling  6 halfway between the ceiling and the floor  then 6 subs on the floor. So you are completely surrounded and sound can be placed virtually anywhere in the field. Say you have something start in the very top left then crash behind you to your right and explode into everything like standing inside a mushroom cloud. You get the picture. Was done at Naut Humon's Recombinant Media Labs studio in SF. Richard Devine  Otto Von Schirach and a bunch of others have also done music on the system. We all did a show around this time last year at the Paradiso in Amsterdam performing some of this 12.6 surround madness'' hvis dette sker  lover jeg at købe en billet hvert år  resten af mit liv,0
About right.. what do you do after Roskilde Festival?  ,0
upload a video from the die antwoord concert,0
Hi  I join the initiative lost & found  human edition. Well that's the story: I was at the Kwabs concert at the pavilion and I saw this very beautiful girl and danced next to her  but suddenly I lost her in the crowd. To give a description: she's around 1 70 m  looks like an Indian girl  so dark skin  black hair. I also have a picture that I attach (she's the one seated and dressed in black). I came back from the festival with great sensations but with also the regret I don't know anything about her. Please if anyone can help me find this girl it would be great. It is very important to me...thanks!!  Ps: if you read this  I was the guy with the yellow t-shirt!!,0
Will there be a video from Florence's performance from  Roskilde Festival 2015 here? OR maybe it exists but I cannot find anything?,0
I was wondering when the information about the Spiel 2012 ticket action will be send around. It stated 26 November on this page.,0
Hi Tobias. It has been a bit delayed  but should be hitting your mailbox in a few hours,0
Thank you so much for booking Slipknot!!! :-),0
Wouldn't be so sure that it is Slipknot. Teaser fits Stone Sour better.,0
How many studio albums have Stone Sour released?,0
Stone sour havent released 5 album though.. Well.. only if you count House of gold and bones part 2 which first will be released next year... :),0
Slipknot have released 5 studio albums. Self titled album  Iowa  Subliminal Verses  All hope is gone and Antennas from Hell.,0
It's not that hard for Corey to tour with both bands in Europe next summer. Both Stone Sour and Slipknot have booked gigs in Europe next summer.,0
New music announcement tomorrow. Here's a little teaser. Can you crack the code?,32
the hell?,0
Cracked it! Awesome!,0
5 albums and from Iowa ...,0
for a brief moment  I thought it was Slipknot,0
It's definitely the state of Iowa,0
if this is slipknot i will shit myself HOLY FUCK TO SEE THEM AT ROSKILDE,0
lame  that doesnt look anything like finland. :S,0
something with Iowa / five times record?... ehmmm: Slipknot?,0
Hmmm this looks allot like that state of Iowa... I dont know what all the other stuff is... my guess is Slipknot,0
IOWA - 5 albums...  Slipknot springs to mind,0
Slipknot... Band from Iowa with 5 records,0
Stone Sour is in Europe from June 7.  And their fifth album is out next year.,0
the guitarist from The Killers  is from Iowa and they've made their 5th album this year,0
the killers,0
Well  it's a map of Iowa. But what do the five markings on the map represent?,0
Stone Sour releases their 5th album and second part of  House of Gold & Bones  in May  and tours Europe in June. Might Roskilde be their last stop? But they're also in Vega in two weeks..,0
http://www.stonesour.com/tourdates Stone Sour plays Sweden 28june  Graspop  BE 30june.,0
So far Roskilde Festival is doing good! :D,0
Can't figure the band name out  but here is the 5 cities marked:  Sioux City (Woodbury) Waterloo (Black Hawk) Des Moines (Polk) Cedar Rapids (Linn) Quad Cities (Scott),0
It seems the five dots represent: Sioux City  Moline/Davenport  Cedar Rapids  Cedar Falls/Waterloo and Des Moines.,0
I'm guessing Stone Sour  though it could of course be Slipknot as well. Modern Life Is War is also from Iowa  and have 5 records. Sadly they don't exist anymore!,0
If Slipknot will come then i hope Roskilde will also book AC/DC,0
The green vinyl  MATE FEED KILL REPEAT  is an official release  which makes a total of five official vinyl releases...  => SLIPKNOT...!!!,0
Slipknot have only released 4 albums so don't think so,0
slipknot...o.m.g,0
My mind.  It has been blown.,0
please let it be slipknot,0
The Black Keys,0
its rage against the machine !!!,0
i'm guessing Justin Bieber,0
Can it fucking be! SLIPKNOT! Fuck year!!!,0
It is the state of Iowa  so it must be Slipknot.,0
I know that state...,0
Also new band from Metaltown tomorrow. Metaltown and Roskilde Festival will be the samme weekend next year. I m 100 sure we will get metal headliner tomorrow,0
Slipknot will rock the place in 2013!!!,0
Slipknot is playing in the UK June 14th. But Stone Sour is also playing in Scandinavia around that time. Arrrrh what will it be?,0
Hear ye! David Bowie!! An eye for an eye!!,0
OMGAAAAAAWD!!!!! :O,0
SLIPKNOT!!!!! :D,0
TL DR: I would enjoy Slipknot for reasons.  If it is Slipknot  I will be a happy man for one reason  and that is I saw them the last time and my whole camp enjoyed that pumping show they pulled off no matter of their musical preference. I would love Tool too  and hell a lot of other bands that need a shot on the orange  but a concert is an experience and we need diversity in those experiences. I've heard a lot of good music on RF but a lot of the musicians are lacking that awesome stage show. I'm not saying at all Slipknot is that and Tool or other bands wouldn't be  but Slipknot delivered the last time and I think they would again.,0
Emil N Jakobsen  whatever we might end up with tomorrow  we guarantee you that we'll do other ones that you won't find easy at all.,0
@Oliver hulehøj- captain obvious strikes again... xD,0
If it's slipknot  what's upwith the dots? (this goes for stone sour as well :P),0
Iowa: Slipknot home town 5 album: Slipknot  Cant you crack the code: Slipknot are useing barcodes on ther old jumsuites  So there you go  Its Slipknot.. Hellcome back :),0
yeah  but what about the dots and red lines?,0
I will cry happy tears  if it's Slipknot :'),0
If it is Slipknot  then I hope David Bowie will play as well  finally  ),0
Stone Sour is playing @ Vega the 17th of December. Would be kinda weird if they were back in Denmark so soon. My guess is Slipknot  with Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.  they've released 5 studio albums.,0
the lines and dots are just major roads and cities in Iowa  check out google maps,0
Lol ok  then I kinda agree on the easy teaser part  don't really mind tho  I heard Slipknot puts on a great show  never seen them live!,0
Slipknot is also playing at Download... wouldn't surprise me if they are paying Denmark a visit before returning to the states. I'm thinking the same with 30 Seconds To Mars and A Day To Remember.,0
Please not The Killers. They are so boring,0
The Killers are from Las Vegas!,0
We can all agree that this is Iowa.. It can either be Slipknot or Stone Sour  since Corey Taylor are the lead singer i both bands. But then again? Maybe its neither of them :),0
Or both...,0
Let it be stone sour!!!!,0
T-T-TOM WAITS??  Oh please let it be so!,0
Tom Waits is neither from Iowa  nor has he only released five albums. How the hell do you get to that?,0
Anders - Im surprised not more people see RATM in this teaser..,0
.... or AC/DC or Metallica - I really want Metallica,0
Yeah AC/DC and Metallica please :),0
HERP A DERPTALLICA,0
hahahaha :D gotta love it  ),0
It could be Stone Sour... They are from Iowa aswell  and are set for loads of summer festivals  escpecially the metal festivals around Europe...,0
but stone sour isn't about to release their 5th album,0
Yes they are. House of Gold and Bones pt. 2 is out next year.  But Slipknot seems more and more likely: http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article15881584.ab,0
http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/slipknot-to-play-roskilde-festival-2013/,0
Much too easy teaser  we've learned. We'll up the ante!,0
Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds performing Lock All the Doors live at the Arena Stage at Roskilde Festival 2015.,19
Hey Simon  do you remember this?! :),0
Hahaha yeah you looked like you had the time of your life :)),0
The swimming lake might be dead calm and peaceful at 4 a.m. But at Roskilde the surroundings seldom are.,0
Once again Street City offered an abundance of shows  activities and parties. Check out a few of the highlights.,12

Hey Roskilde   will it be  or is it  possible to create your own programme on your website? I think I remember that you could mark the bands you would like to se  and then create a programme with just the bands you planned to see,0
The smartphone app will probably support that,0
If you mark your favourites here  and use Facebook Connect  they will all appear in the new app when we launch it in June: http://beta.roskilde-festival.dk,0
Thanks for the answer. Does that mean I cant create a personal band-schedule without connecting it to Facebook?,0
Lasse Sinding Kristensen  you can - but if you want our database to remember you for the app  you have to connect. Otherwise it's just based on a cookie,0
Not this year,0
Højager Jørgensen  we haven't abandoned the tradition for good. We had to make some choices in order to get Outkast and The Rolling Stones who were both available for Thursday. But we still want to use the Orange Stage to promote new scandinavian bands. For example we have Klumben & Raske Penge on Sunday.,0
The full schedule is ready  including five new acts: Seeed  EMA  Nikolaj Nørlund  Faustix and DJ Food  DJ Cheeba & DJ Moneyshot.  Download schedule: http://po.st/RF14schedule,160
Why on earth is Drake closing Orange and not Mr. Wonder??,0
Haha! Nice with Outkast opening orange! xD,0
You already said that a while ago.,0
Oh shit  Bastille plays when Rolling Stones are still playing... Damn.. This is gonna be a tough decision...,0
Less & Less concerts in Arena & Orange stage( starting later and later in the day). Many small bands on orange. Rob Zombie friday headliner  really??  The program lacks rock & metal headliners  Rolling Stones took the amount of 3-4 other headliners it looks like...,0
enough with the fucking DJs,0
Hmmmmm definitely NOT what i was hoping for... outkast 1830? Drake??,0
future islands at 13:00 is just wrong.,0
why is Damon Albarn not on orange??? I don't think that is gonna work out!,0
The Men playing the same time as the Arctic Monkeys?? Not many genuine rock bands as it is.,0
The few bands/artists I actually want to see are all really close together. Rolling Stones + Bastille  Deftones + Damon Albarn + Mogwai  Arctic Monkeys + Interpol  Diplo + Nails + Stevie Wonder... Ah well.,0
I want to go!!! From Shanghai,0
Lookin pretty good. Wouldve prefered to see Outkast in the dark but ohwell.,0
WHYYYY do you have to make me choose betweem Mogwai and Darkside,0
Moderat and Future Islands are both in semi-weird slots  imo. Other than that  looks good  and nice with Nikolaj Nørlund!,0
Fantastisk!!! Mø and Nikolaj nørlund :))),0
Thank you so much for Seeed :D :D :D,0
Thank you so much for being so fast putting the schedule together! :D,0
Fantastic program  but I'm not happy with the Stones/Bastille and Horrors/Wonder clashes.,0
Felix - did you see this? :D,0
I was ready to blow my brains out at the Ferg and Drake concerts... any chance that the schedule could be re-arranged so that one of them could be moved from the last day?,0
MØ and Stevie Wonder playing at the same time. SOO difficult to choose (if I was going).,0
Mogwai and Darkside playing simultaneously? Seems odd  since they might appeal to much of the same audience. Here's to hoping it's a mistake.,0
How long is a typical set? One hour?,0
Sif Heide-Ottosen Giuseppe Sorrentino Alexander Hegg Oscar Spendrup I fucking wish I could go to this!!!! (but I really don't understand why drake is playing after Stevie....... ew.),0
I can not to see The Rolling Stones  it will be my Roskilde festival nr 15 and my Rolling Stones concert nr 8 :) and lots of acts to see on the friday 4 july :),0
Omfg seeed?! THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN ROSKILDE!!!!! (Thought it was the end of announcements!),0
Seeed! Again another great German Act!!!!,0
Thinking about buying a ticket now. I see that you can  Add ONS . Is there any chance of getting the same girl two times  if buying seven ONS?,0
Hope it does not rain!!!,0
Rain? Never heard of it...,0
It never rains at Roskilde,0
Is there any way to rent a tent house and have it brought to Roskilde? I'm coming from overseas.,0
We're all out of tent houses (of this kind: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/tenthouse/)  but perhaps this is something for you: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent_central_and_east/,0
What's the track?,0

Muse performing one of their new songs  Psycho  live from Roskilde Festival 2015.   What was your favourite moment from their concert?,173
My favourite moment was beeing at Bikstok Røgsystem! :D,0
Sandrine Biduda :D :D :D,0
Only got it on TV :-( ... but my favourite moment was ... the whole concert :-),0
Did you also record Mew?,0
When they played Mercy and the confetti blew up all over the place  followed by the balloons in Reapers <3,0
Awesome  one of the best live bands you will ever see,0
Loved it!!! ????,0
This was good  but nothing beat the extra number with Knights of Cydonia and Uprising. It was magic  the ground was shaking and the audience was in ecstasy.,0
I loved the concert  and it was truly one of the best moments I've ever had on Roskilde Festival ever. But the fact that Orange Press/Soundvenue (who ever actually wrote the article) gave the concert 4 out of 6 stars (orange stages/tents  whatever) is completely laughable  especially when you look at some of the other concerts that got the same rating. I fully aware of the fact that not everybody experiences everything the same way  but c'mon 4 out of 6 is just not fair. I would like to point out that Nicki Minaj got the same score/rating by Orange Press (if it wasn't 5/6..) and I never heard anyone say anything good about that concert. I was just wondering how that could happen. Just to get my point across  a bit bluntly... I hate that RF started to suck up to the main stream popstars compared to previously - the previous years  we saw the same thing with Rihanna  awful show high rating. Non the less the bad rating in the Orange Press didn't ruin my favorite moment of #RF15 which was Muse. Anyhøw  have a nice one.,0
Therese Scott one of the best   just like you said it would be!,0
Melvin Chng  do more jumping in the gym. Wilfred Chng,0
My favorite muse moment was when i went to Bikstok,0
I liked this  track  more when they played it as an outro/filler to Stockholm Syndom instead of this shit! So polished and steril! I don't like it!,0
Once again a fantastic koncert delivered by MUSE on Orange stage!!,0
A moment that will never be forgotten...Elisa  Lars  Anne  Scott & Robert <3,0
Completely awsome this New song!!!!!,0
the entire concert! only bad thing was that they didnt play Map of Problematique which is one of my favorite track with Muse,0
There was a lot of anticipation in the air before the concert started and Muse did not disappoint.  Probably the first time ever  the opening Drill Instructor/Psycho was my favourite part.  Usually  like most people  it is the last couple of tracks!,0
When they played Uprising and everybody threw in some vocals :),0
Muse is a great live band always! I've seen them 5 times now! : ),0
Knights of Cydonia was great  but Psycho was pretty good too.,0
Uprising was definitely one of my favorites! But in general I just loved the vibe in the crowd  everyone went nuts! In the best possible way! They were amazing!,0
it was a stunner! Blew everyone else off stage (except perhaps Africa Express) and showed what REAL performance looks like.,0
Their encore for sure!!,0
Psycho opening and the habitual Stockholm Syndrome. It never gets old. I was bawling out of every orifice known to man for the entirety of the show. Get em back  Ill be back.,0
the best moment was Madness =),0
Will there be a video with Die Antwoord? Or are they too  obscene  for Facebook?  :P,0
whole concert was my favourite moment.....,0
Amy spot us in the front?  ),0
Best this year,0
Everything about the concert was awesome! Mercy and Plug in Baby <3 MUSE stole my heart! :D,0
Andreas Helgeby you've seen this? ????,0
I wasn't really that familiar with the band prior to this show  but it was one of my favorite ones this year.,0
the options in today's video differs from the ones presented on the site :O  ,0
tickets set.. better learn some Danish then?,0

Dear you   Fetch your calendar and mark the dates 29 June-7 July – because YOU are invited to the biggest and most exceptional party of the year. Roskilde Festival 2013 will be 9 days you’ll never forget. We guarantee.

We give you about 200 live concerts  spectacular art installations whereever you go  bedazzling events  excellent food  a swimming lake  a cinema  a skatepark and much more.  Still  it won’t be much fun without YOU providing the unique atmosphere and community feeling  so characteristic for Roskilde Festival.  The whole shebang takes place only a 30-minute train ride from Copenhagen  so it’s no hassle getting here.  We can’t wait to see you!  Lots of love    Roskilde Festival  PS. Roskilde Festival donates all profits to humanitarian and cultural purposes.,0

2. Girls love it. Of course.,0
It's a shame that the December quiz seems to be pretty lame this year. Last year the quiz was about music and performances at Roskilde through the years. That was really fun. This is not.,0
Camp Tom Selleck baby!!! :D,0
Marc Wolfgram  give it a chance.,0
Remember to fill in your answer here if you want to WIN: www.roskilde-festival.dk/whathappensnext,0
Does the guided tour backstage pirze include tickets for RF 2013? :),0
Michael  nope. You need to get the ticket yourself.,0
I completely agree with Marc  but I'll give it some days to improve before I call it lame.  Last years December quiz was nothing short of fantastic and I used hours on research to find the right anwers and a discussion with Roskilde Festival on the infamous Fat Boy Slim question. Considering I got all correct last year and won the quiz at the festival with my fellow Camp Spies this year maybe you should include me in your quiz team.,0
http://soniahunt.com/images/2012/06/selleck.jpg  Can't be anything else than a selleck tribute  they even have the same distant look in their eyes!,0

Hey Roskilde Festival  cool - so it's no problem when I show up at the GetATent with someone else's GetATent-ticket? Katrine  sry  har netop aftalt at bytte med en anden :),0
This sounds pretty genius. Imagine if all the pee on Roskilde could power one of the stages. Gloria's colour is yellow  so why not?,0
Queens of the Stone Age  C2C and Daedelus are added to the Roskilde Festival 2013 lineup.   Tickets are out now! It seems we forgot to change the price  so get one quickly on www.burl.dk/RF13,202

I hope they also book Metallica and make them for 10th anniversary concert. Metallica played las time in 2003,0
Sigur Rós was also in 2003. Maybe Blur then also. They played last time in 2003 at Roskilde :),0

Refused by acquirer,0
what am i suppose to do? i tried 2 cards. i have paypal but you don't accept paypal.,0
Roskilde Festival No worries. I had to call Visa. They put a block on it because it was an unusual transaction. Maybe put a disclaimer for international customers.,0
That's good to hear. See you this summer!,0

Tjena!Any heavy metal acts coming up for this years line up?Still miss some classic metal,0
There is lots of them already booked. Dont expect more. The program is pretty much complete.,0

We usually do. Sorry about the late answer. You can ask your question here and this admin will try to answer it. Otherwise we'll make sure to follow up on it on Monday,0
Monday is just fine  thank you...8),0
Hi again  I still haven't heard anything from you? Could you please reply on my mail from the 4th of May.,0
Last year you could buy a deal with beer and some sparkling wine/cider-package online for a nice price  will you do that this year as well? :) They ran out so fast last year!,0
We'll do something like that this year as well. They'll be available soon. We'll keep you posted :),0
Yaay! Thanks :D,0
Just remember to read the very small stuff on that ticket. Last year it could only be used certain days.. We  lost  two boxes of beers that way for our 5th year anniversary :/,0
We asked Trentemøller to pick the artists  he's looking forward to the most at this year's festival. He's particularly keen to hear the English post punk act The Horrors:  – I've followed this band since their debut album in 2007 and they're constantly exploring the limits of their sound. Their gothic  rich sound has inspired me so much  and they're always great live.  Listen to Trentemøllers Roskilde 2014 favourites in Spotify: http://po.st/Trentemoller,8
Excellent idea Roskilde Festival. Will there be other artist picks like these?,0
The Horrors warmed up for Muse when they played in Parken back in 2009.  They were not good. I hope they have improved their act!,0
Well.. What Trentemøller is inspired by is deffenately worth a look :) I love Trentemøller's music  I might like The Horrors as well :) Thanks for sharing!,0
Cant believe James Holden  not on ??? :(,0
Horrors are cool,0
WOW - did he eat Chriatian Christian Brøns :-),0
Nice  we looking forward to the same artist the most! :),0

Gary Clark Jr.  Joe Bonamassa  Metallica  Aloe Blacc and The Black Keys. Those are the names I'd like to see,0
Wristbands from 1986 to 1994,0
At our website it says that we'll draw lots today  so you can't be a part of the draw if we don't have your video:  http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/be-part-of-the-diy-line-up-video/ You can  however  send your video to  kasper.arildskov@roskilde-festival.dk and we may still include it in the final DIY line-up video,0
Not quite sure what you mean. But you should click buy ticket -> entrance booking -> choose your entrance and click find tickets -> choose number of tickets and click continue. Does that help?,0
I'm not able to press continue anywhere  so i thought i should add it to my ticket somhow,0
Well  we'll have to do something about that  won't we?,0
I think you should - And while you are at it: Parov Stellar would making everyone happy,0
My wristbands from 1989 to 2012. Unfortunately i missed 1998...,0
That's so cool!  We're considering doing a wristband for the Roskilde Steady-goers. So if you can show us 10 wristbands  we might give you a SPECIAL honourary Roskilde wristband (+ you keep your old wristbands  of course).,0
Hello Roskilde Festival  I'm interested in using your logo for a school-project  and wish to implement on an armband which has to be presented to my teacher as part of a 'creative-element'. Are there any rights I need to consider  when it's solely for the purpose of a school-project?,0
When will it be able to wish bands again for the coming festival?? I apparently missed the first  shot -.-,0
Hey I didn't know about this option and I put down the white plastic part from my armbånd :( do you think that I can also get en roskilde armbånd even if I am missing that white part?,0
Hi Alex. No problem Just send in the orange wristband along side an envelope with your name  adress and a stamp on it.,0
The Weeknd,0
Hello Roskilde Festival When will more publications? Waiting anxiously after Northside pt. has been well under way.,0
seems to be on Wednesday mornings so i am guessing tomorrow morning would be a good bet,0
Nothing this time around  sorry.,0
Anders is right. Nothing has been released - except for this EP -> http://www.discogs.com/Trentem%C3%B8ller-Live-In-Concert-EP-Roskilde-Festival-2007/master/66523,0
Are you planning to announce a teaser or two anytime soon?,0
Here you go! http://i.imgur.com/jjXyH.jpg?1,0
Roskilde Festival is this http://i.imgur.com/jjXyH.jpg?1 teaser true ?,0
I think you are right Rasmus  I would guess  that it's from 2012  there are only seven headliners  two of them starts with the (the Cure and the Roots) and the last name is from US (Jack White). What side is Imgur anyway.,0
Ladies and gentlemen   Pharrell Williams live from Roskilde Festival 2015!,99
He thinks he is in copenhagen...,0
Good songs but overall the performance seemed a bit dull.,0
William Riancho I think we can see you at the last seconde on the viedo !!!!!   ),0
I really was disappointed with this whole performance.  It seemed to be more about  I'm famous and these are some bits of the noises you can buy  rather than any real music or performance.  I know it is all subjective - but I expected more from an ostensibly 'global' star.,0
THIS IS FROM COPENHAGEN ...  Stop stealing videos Roskilde  ),0
Will you release the Lamb of God concert as well?,0
Camille Skaaning!!! :D,0
Andreas Alving 2:33! :D,0
 ?...Because I'm happy...? ,0
Can you tell us when you have approximately 5% tickets left? It would be horrible to wake up one day and realize that getting a ticket to my favorite festival no longer would be possible.,0
#rf14 MØ - DIY line-up video,0

These guys look awesome!,0
Here you go. 3 new acts who will add a little extra sunshine to the Roskilde days. Just press play and those 53 days of waiting will go by in a heartbeat.  More info: http://po.st/vV28A9,23

Will David Byrne be joining the atomic bomb band?,0
Great additions. Now give me Phophorescent and I will be more than pleased.,0
Fantastic. I had hoped for some sort of miracle to bring William Onyeabor to Roskilde. This will do :),0
I was at the Onyeabor tribute concert in Brooklyn last week and it was fire! Solid booking!,0
don't ever use the words  red hot  and  funk  in the same post like that again if ur not talking about the band everybody's obviously gonna think of... p,0

You had Blue leggings on with some black  looked like a space or so  and long blonde hair.  maybe 18-20 years old or so,0
You now have 8 days left to compose an OFFICIAL Roskilde Festival RINGTONE.  We know that this tune (http://youtu.be/5EiEUxWwB3M) is hard to beat  but it's still for our Against Drugs campaign. PLUS we prefer an audience-made tune - so start composing out there!,1
http://youtu.be/CZZfzujvnDo,0
I went to 13 consecutive Hultsfred's before I stopped and the festival went bankrupt :) Never mind that  these are the ones i have from the 90's  the two broken ones on top are Hultsfred 1996 & 1997 and the one in the bottom is Emmaboda 1998.,0

Hi  in a post earlier I mentioned that I am from belgium  now there has been a change of plans. (long story)  Now my question is   does Roskilde get sold out quickly or do u get sometime to consider buying ur ticket?,0
Hi Anna. I would like to get in contact with you. Can you please write we at ane.hoyer@roskilde-festival.dk,0
Yes you can. You can enter when everyone with Entrance Booking have entered. Probably about 15-30 minutes later,0
Airbourne will play in Europe next summer. They will be awesome to have to next year Roskilde Festival. I saw them in Stockholm 2 years ago and the show was awesome and they will rock out at Roskilde if you will book them :),0

Søren  Martin and Tanja  that is our campaign tune for our against drugs campaign. Now we want a tune for all Roskilde Festival.,0
For me and a whole bunch of others - that campaign is a great part of defining Roskilde Festival. I don't just see it as your campaign against drugs  but also as the sound that tells me that in a few minutes we're done waiting for the artist(s) on the stage and we are about to have a great  musical experience - a lifetime experience.,0
Martin: Though I don't know for sure  the  Roskilde Against Drugs  might still be playing before the concerts for many years to come (no promises though). And it does make a good ringtone (heard it on lots of phones). Maybe the question should be more like:  Which of these ringtones  a lot of them made by festivalgoers  do you like? Which sounds most like Roskilde? .  It's not because we can't use the Against Drugs tune  or you are not ever-never to use it as a ringtone and we will never mention its name again. It's just because we quite literally and whole-heartedly want to include your ideas  dreams (and in this case: tunes made by you)  in shaping the Roskilde Festival experience. Small steps towards co-creating the festival. And yes  it might sound a bit hippie  but we mean it :-),0
There's a really good  Led Zep  like track with this one ! (	 although it seems to be the most shared track ?) I like it :o) It reminds me some great concerts... http://roskilde.audiodraft.com/entry/38#.UKzeWt7yU0M.facebook,0
I understand. I just wanted to applause the 'against drugs'-tune. :-),0
Thank you all- both the workers at the festival & the guests that made yet another year great :) - couldn't you please put out the piano-plinketiplonk & the  Are you ready  that goes on the big screens just before the conserts...? ...then I can put it as a ringtone/sms signal & keep the Roskildefeeling alive everytime my phone starts ringing at work next week... :),0
SARABI says Thank You Roskilde Festival,0
I hope the waiting areas/entrence booking is better this year because last year it was a mess:(,0
Isnt there a minor artist release today?,0
I don't think they've begun on the regular artist releases every (or most) wednesdays yet.,0
Oh maan =( thought they started after the first release last week on wednesday,0
It's never a guarantee that we announce acts EVERY week. We try to  though. And most often we do it on a Wednesday.,0
Well  looking forward to next time,0
Dear Roskilde Festival  seriously  why paper wristbands for the volunteers? The quality is so poor that already on the second day wearing it you can't tell what's written on it. As a volunteer you would want to be proud of wearing the wristband of awesomeness - not just some lousy slip of paper. Please go back to plastic wristbands  please!,0
Many reasons. One of them being that we could print barcodes straight onto the wristbands. That being said  we know that quality can be improved (it was year one).,0
here you are,0

Africa Express played a massive 5 hour concert at Roskilde Festival 2015. About 90 musicians from 23 different countries threw one hell of a party at the Arena Stage Saturday night.   Damon Albarn had to be carried off the stage by Africa Express' stage manager Big Dave after 5 amazing hours.  Photos by: Matías Altbach,182
I think I may have the best picture of the festival:) Is there a contest or something? How do we share? :),0

We looking into it but can't guarantee anything.,0
Short answer: We are convinced that the festival is better with a duration of 8 days compared to 9 days. Longer answer: We've seen a tendency in the evaluations from the audience and volunteers that many are tired and exhausted come Thursday. We also wanna make sure that there is a wide variety of cultural experiences available at all times during the warm-up days.,0
If you could get all these artists to do like a mash up show or something  it would probably be the best dubstep concert EVER. http://open.spotify.com/album/0aNMhW79KsjxgMc554UMN1,0

What was this year's Roskilde camp area hit song? (Like 'call me maybe' was in 2013) It bothers me that I don't know. I had to stay home this year. But can someone tell me?,0
This year was my first time and i'm hooked. One of the best weeks in my life. See you next year Roskilde!!,0
Moisha this is what it was like  best thing ever,0
I miss the festival already. Roskilde Festival is the best place in the world,0
I came from the UK for my first ever Roskilde festival and it was worth every second. The food was amazing  the mix of acts was eye opening and the weather gorgeous (typically Danish right?). Love the quirky sense of humor too and I am glad to have played my part in recycling beer crop!,0
Thank you for The best festival ever. I miss it already????????????,0

Roskilde festival was amazing! The only thing i didnt like were the   Showers. I really need Some privacy. Are there any plans to change it for next year or am i the only one who have problems with iT?,0
Love it  love Roskilde.  30 years of love.,0
Thank You :D,0
Sure Roskilde festival was great again  but I missed the big international rock acts at orange scene.  I come now for over 20Years but this year  I think there were a lot of danish bands and Hip hop and electro.,0
wait  they have hipsters in Denmark?,0
Second to none.. Thank U.. See you next year.. #rf15,0

awesome event ! looking forward to the next one !,0
Emily what i was talking about,0
Who knows!?!? :P,0
What about next year. .... you never know what will happen ?,0
I hope I can make it! I go to Bonnaroo and Electric Forest here in the U.S. Which are both in June so if I were to make this one I would be spending tons of money and have to take a lot of time off for work. My goal is to attend as many festivals as I can in life! #timetowinthelottery #hopefully,0
Yay thats the spirit!  Well you should make next year a Roskilde numero Uno!  ??????,0
I'm hoping too! Roskilde looks next level  the lineup this year was amazazing so I hope I can make it  idk how much it would cost me all together though  haven't really researched it yet. I also want to go to Glastonbury and Tomorrowland and Creamfields which are a couple other European festivals that look awesome! Are there any others in Europe you would recommend? Trying to broaden my festival horizon :),0
SAME,0
hey will if ya need any help gettin over this way pm me im a american who lives here in roskilde and it only cost me 300 for a one way to get here so ive got some info on a super cheap way of doin it if ya want to Will :),0
I'd wager you could do the transport back and forth plus the ticket for the festival on about $1000  but you also need to eat and drink. You could also do volunteer work on the festival to avoid paying for the ticket.,0
U'll love it!,0
You know it!,0
Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better) - Felix Jaehn  Jasmine Thompson,0
Hi Scott. What are you reffering to?,0
You were there biatch?,0
It's been the same for the seventeen consecutive years I've been there  so I'm inclined to believe that it isn't going to change. A better option for you might be to rent a room or an apartment in the town of Roskilde via Airbnb or something like that  granting you all the privacy you need.,0
Feel you on that one mate :(,0
Could we get some crowdfunding for this guy please,0
I would love to!??looks quite cool!!,0
same here! it looks just too good! if i am actually off  I'll let you know! :),0
i'm sure you'll find lots of other germs (hehehe),0
Well the last 6 years on Roskilde Festival has been pretty nice.But weather is only 20% festivalfeeling  if not less! :),0
You should just come. If you have average socialskill you'll do just fine :),0
I hope you find her!,0
i sould  but just the fly is un $20 000.00 pesos  is like $2 500.00 dollars or more  if The dollar still like it being for months...so it is quite hard you know... but someday i will be there... i wont lose the hope!,0
Either Lean On or King Kunta,0
the weeknd - can't feel my face,0
Festival feeling is awesome. I was missing it so much that I booked myself for Reading 2015 in August :-D,0
Muse  paul mccartney  war on drugs  thåstrøm etc etc?,0
Thaström is not a international Act. Muse and War in drugs were some of These few big names. No one I Met was very satisfied with the booking of Paul McCartney. But maybe many People went to his Concert because there were no other big names.,0
DO IT! :3,0
I think the showers are just fine,0
how fun!!,0

HENRIK NORDAHL  ROSKILDE FESTIVAL:- WHERE ARE YOU LINE FROM DENMARK? 12 t ·  Hey! I met my soon-to-be wife and mother of my children the last day of Roskilde. The sad thing is that I forgot to get her full name or number... Maybe you know her? Line  from Denmark  dark blonde  eyes from another dimension - brownish yellow in the middle and green outwards. She stayed in camp C and studies psychology  22 years old. Thanks a bunch!,0
It would be great to see bands from the caribbean such as Haiti. Bands like  Zing Experience  and  Jah Nesta . Also Brooklyn NY # 1 Band and the winners of the Ultimate battle of New york :  Brown Rice Family . ,0
http://www.festivalrykten.se/neil-young-mot-peace-love/ Let s get Neil Young also to Roskilde :),0
Sooo...I was in Sri Lanka when the DIY line-up competition was announced! #rf14,0
Sorry  that won't be possible. 10x10 and 5x5 will be near each other  but not right next to each other.,0
We haven't quite figured it out yet. But you'll receive an email as soon as we have,0
and how are you supposed to control 12000 in a waiting area. My educated guess is the the fence will fall at noon Sunday...the latest. I'd much rather see more waiting areas with fewer ppl,0
If people decide not to act like monkeys and spoiled children  then maybe it will go down well  like it did in 2012. But like it is with most voluntary organisations  Roskilde will just need to put their faith in people and work with available means to control the crazies.,0
I agree  ppl should be able to behave like humans...but then again  many don't. and the tension building up with 12000 ppl in a confined space wanting to get into another condined space  add a splash of alcohol into the mixture and I'm afraid it won't be a pretty sight.,0
I agree.. It seems like an impossible job to control.. I personally would have hired an external security company to manhandle all trespassers who enter before time.. But that's not quite in the festival's spirit :),0
The very early arrivers can now book an entrance.  We offer entrance booking for those who want to be among the very first to conquer the camping grounds.  Read more and book your entrance: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/the-early-arrivers-can-now-book-an-entrance/,47
Tobias Jelen Mohammed Ali Karim Jonatan Rosendal Hansen Rasmus Gras Mikael Akakpo O'Connor,0
So we will be able to wait in line for 26 hours? Will it be the same waiting areas as last year?,0
Hi Roskilde Festival. We have planned to camp in campsite J  and we want to buy the Entrance Booking. But which entrance shall we take? South? look likes thats one is the closest?,0
Could elaborate on  waiting areas open saturday 28 June at 16:00 ? Does it mean that people will queue to the queue?,0
I got  a question. My friend and I have already bought tickets before we were able to choose entrance. Are we able to get the entrance booking even though we recieved our tickets already?,0
Hey guys  we're a couple of guys who've bought tenthouse  but not all of us arrives at the same time. Is it possible to arrange tenthouses next to each other?,0
Me and my friend are going to be backpacking through Europe and are wondering if there will be a safe place to store our backpacks at the festival   they are 55 litre packs,0
Oh I can't read danish but thank u for the info :),0
is there a map over the camp site  so i can pick an entrance closest to the place i want to be?,0
I will be arriving on June 29th at 1800 but I have not purchased a ticket yet   me and my friend do not have camping gear so which ticket will we need to buy to get camping gear at roskilde?,0
What a absolute bad idea to have the East 2 waiting area at the same place as get-a-place. It could potentially be turned into a mudpit in case of rain - and it will definately smell of piss  old food and drinks/beer even before the first tent is pitched. Did you actually tell this somewhere to us who bought get-a-place beforehand because I sure didn't see it. I hope you have plan for cleaning up because I've seen the waiting areas the years before and they have been discusting even after the so-called clean-up.,0
Ok I've got a pitched tent in the east area. If I wanna try to get one of the ones as close to the festival site as possible  is there anything in particular that I could do?,0
Can you get into the camping sities at 02:30 30/6/2014?,0
Katrine Thea Pløger Nielsen  yes you can :),0
Bjarke Rønn Knudsen  festival volunteers do not need to book. With your volunteer wristband you can choose any entrance and enter on the same conditions as those with Entrance Booking.,0
Can I still use my Volunteer wristband as acces to the booking area?,0
Morten Kaas  with your volunteer wristband you can choose any entrance and enter on the same conditions as those with Entrance Booking.,0
Alexander Loft Birkmose  thank you for spotting that. We'll fix it. What's meant is that the waiting areas open Saturday 28 June at 16:00 and the entrances open 29 June at 18:00.,0
Mathias Andersen  yes. Print it out and bring it along,0
Cecilie Sandvad  the waiting areas are marked on this map: (not the same as last year) http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2014/Kort_indgangsbooking_28042014.pdf And yes  you can wait for 26 hours if you like. But we recommend that people show up Sunday,0
Josefine Westergaard Lunau Hansen  there will be no bridge between M and L,0
Ida Ritter Nørskov  yes  you can. You just have to wait until everybody with Entrance Booking has entered.,0
Andreas Bonnichsen  that's up to you. We can't say what areas the festival-goers will go for. And remember  J is Silent & Clean area.,0
Alfred Johan Müller  the waiting areas are where the queues are. So you can queue up from Saturday 28 June at 16:00,0
Jon Toivo Hansen  that's the Clean Out Loud area. It will be located in E this year.,0
Jesper Bangsgaard. M is only for those who have Get A Tent  Get A Place  Rockwool Shelter or Tenthouse,0
Okay  that makes sense. May I suggest that you mark those reserved areas on the official map  Roskilde Festival?,0
Simon Svendsen  yes. You can book your entrance separately from your ticket purchase.,0
Eik Svend Barnewitz  Entrance Booking is only available with  Ticket fast .,0
I second Jon's sentiment – please mark which areas that are gone already in advance. We're a bunch of people that are going for agora E each year  so it would be very helpful to know where NOT to strike.,0
Or at least tell us if it is the northernmost or southernmost part of E?,0
Louis Gjerrild  as Peter says  we will only give notice when we're very close to sold out. Best advice is to buy now if you know you're going.,0
Niklas Birksted  if you give your vouchers to the person who arrives first  you can solve it that way,0
Seriously? That sucks. We might need to rethink our strategy then. I think info like this should be available before making entrance booking available just so people can plan accordingly.,0
Cool! See you soon!,0
Hello? Is there anyone there  perhaps someone from Clean Out Loud who could comment on how much space in E they're occupying? And where?,0
Anders Cold  we're looking into it...,0
When does the waiting area for the entrance booking area open?,0
Each agora has a luggage storage  but else Copenhagen Central Station has luggage storage for up to 10 days The info is is Danish but should be easy to  find out http://www.hovedbanen.dk/index.php?id=62,0
Kyley Latam  and do notice that this info is only relevant if you plan on arriving on Sunday 29 June at 18:00. If you arrive later than that  just ignore this post.,0
Malik John Ericson  indeed there is. Just follow the link in this post.,0
Kyley Latam  depends on what you mean by camping gear. If you want to buy a pitched tent  the Get A Tent add-on ticket is the right option for you. Don't wait too long getting those tickets  btw.  More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/get_a_tent/,0
So  what's the status then?,0
Joachim Schiødt  if you mean Get A Tent East  then yes - you can book an entrance and head straight for the Get A Tent area.,0
Me and my friend are in the middle of buying tickets and we are wondering if we need t book our entrance in the east side twice because there is two of us or just once?,0
we are buying our tickets on the same visa,0
You need one entrance booking per ticket.,0
Indeed you can. We're open round the clock.,0
I am sure many other people have asked this question but i cant see anywhere that anyone has  so i am wondering  what about the people who have already purchased a full festival ticket? is there any way for us to change that into a specific entrance booking ticket? Roskilde Festival,0
You can get your entrance booking separately from your ticket. So that's no problem,0
Free of charge I'm assuming? I'm just curious how ?,0
https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151945652206706&set=a.99196301705.99302.10248811705&type=1&theater,0
We'll tell you more at 10:00,0
More info tomorrow...,0
Hey! I met my soon-to-be wife and mother of my children the last day of Roskilde. The sad thing is that I forgot to get her full name or number...  Maybe you know her? Line  from Denmark  dark blonde  eyes from another dimension - brownish yellow in the middle and green outwards. She stayed in camp C and studies psychology  22 years old.  Thanks a bunch! :),0
Do you have any more information? :),0
hmm  not so much  she has two younger siblings  is allergic to pollon and is maaybe around 1.7-something high. There is not much to go after :P,0
Okey she sounded like someone i know but some of the things dosn't fit :/ so sorry i can't help you,0
Eager to enter the campsite?  With entrance booking you can be first in line when the campsite opens Sunday 29 June at 18:00.  We'll open up for entrance booking tomorrow at 10:00 (we'll post the link here).,329
Is the M camp a clean area this year?,0
South is not that south as normal :P,0
Where is the workers camp area ?,0
Will it be possible to purchase more than 1 entrance booking at once?,0
I thought you were going to use a different system this year?,0
How will it work this year with the waiting?,0
Louise Mørk (Y),0
So what does that mean to those who bought the ticket before this announcement?,0
Why is there only one West entrance this year? West 2 was crowded enough as it was last year!,0
How will the East 2 entrance effect the GAT/GAP area? Are the Get-a-place available at 18.00 sunday as promised?,0
Rebecca Kjaergaard Leôn Michael Rosenfeldt Remeber to book. And send to the others aswell :),0
How many can book on one entrance? :D,0
hi we have purchased a 10x10m get a place  and on the map I can see it says east 2. But we have booked space  sow we don't need to stand in line  the space is already  marked with the persons name ore something?,0
Do workers have to book an entrance as well?,0
I'm still not quite sure what this is... Does it allow you to get on the campsite earlier? Last year my group had this  but we still spend two hours in line to get our bracelet and entry to the campsite...,0
Since there's only one West entrance this year  will it be scaled up accordingly? Thanks.,0
Roskilde Festival - Why only one entrance in Camp West?,0
West is quite big. Why only 1 entrance all of a sudden?,0
@ Roskilde are you releasing any more one day tickets for Thursday???,0
Jaaaa :D Lise Eide Risanger Heidi Iversen Iria Louise Holter,0
The ticket I'll be getting in on this year is a sponsored ticket from Roskilde Festival - will I need to book entrance as well? On the ticket itself  it says that access to the camping site from sunday (29. june) at 18:00 is included  but it says nothing about which entrance. :),0
Roskilde Festival  will large parts of P or other areas be reserved for schools like last year?,0
what happens if I dont buy entrance booking?,0
Can you enter the festival site via the road that separates camping B  and C with a normal ticket this year?,0
Only one West entrance this year  or am i missing something.,0
hi RF- what about caravan campers? never needed an entrance booking before  but your email doesn't mention us buspeople...?,0
Rune Just,0
how about the volunteers? Can they book entrance too? Do i need to contact my employer?,0
so workes are able to join this entrance-first-in-line for free?,0
Hi Roskilde Festival Will there be a surprise act like  Metallica  was last year. If so  don't answer this (cause it's a surprise) :D,0
Don't count on it. The festival has explicitly ruled out any more headliners this year as opposed to last year. I don't think Metallica was planned as a surprise either – the deal just wasn't finalised until very late in the game.,0

Come SlipKnot to Roskilde in 2013?,0
I was in the pit at that concert  and it was insane.,0
Most insane mosh-pit i have been in so far. Shit went down,0
Is it possible to see the pictures  snapchats and videos that were shown on the big screen at the Orange Stage?? :),0
Inspired by your last picture. This is mine  and i am looking forward to add more to the collection <3<3,0
What a way to close the Orange Stage.   Here's a picture from Suspekt's massive party by festival-goer Ditte Petersen.,41

Hahahahah :D :D,0
Er det her inde man skal uploade video til  Greatest artist of 2014  på 10 sek.? if so here it is :D,0
Yes. Thank you for your contribution,0
Hey Roskilde  I'm pretty sure that you said somewhere that one of the headliners would play Arena (as previous years)  BUT now I can't find it (and I REALLY looked through your FB-page). Was i dreaming?,0
I read the same ting in a RF comment in one of the threads for the posterrelease. I can't figure out which one it should be though.,0
This admin can't recall such a comment. Perhaps it was in an interview somewhere?,0
Thx for the reply. I have no idea. Follow Roskilde  to much   so basically it could be anywhere. I'll see at the full schedule release :).,0
Maybe we did write something like that. Anyways  the schedule will be out in May  then you'll know.,0
Just made this short video showing my favorite band at #rf14 :D,0
Fabulous upcoming Barka Dilo from Belgrade! Wish you would bring them to Roskilde Festival  maybe even just for warm-up! ,1
Hey Roskilde! Can you say anything about  when the last acts are going to play thursday?,0
Well  the bars in the festival area closes at 01.00 thursday. So around that time the music stops aswell.,0
That is not correct. Last year Ingrid started playing at 01.00,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gtnll2tVSI Please make it happened PLEASE  :),0
Blur to play Open`er Festival in Poland. That is the same weekend as Roskilde. Blur will also play Rock Werchter. I really hope that you have also book Blur. It will make me so happy if you will book Blur :),0
Biffy Clyro Rage against the machine Papa roach The streets!  Kom frisk Roskilde!!,0
We had zero problems but then again we left at 0700 this morning.,0

Thursday - for the simple reason that Outkast is playing!,0
Friday!!! Phil and deftones ??,0
Erik Ertzgaard  we don't have stage allocations yet. The full schedule is out in May.,0

Mads Aagaard  upcoming music on two stages - Rising and Apollo Countdown. They're not included here  though  but they will be in the full schedule coming out in May.,0
Lene Kragh  have a look at Sunday.,0
Dahlia Dahan  playing between Monday and Wednesday. We'll let you know when the full schedule is out.,0
That what Im a bit worried about. Stones is number one though so its an easy choice if they should clash,0
Based on Mac Millers show two years ago  and Kendricks last year   he should definitely play Arena.,0
All days are drinking days but saturday a bit more  ),0
Panos Bartzis  we like THAT description!,0
Adam Nilsson  that's right. See here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/band/singleband/major-lazer/ - and here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/band/singleband/diplo/,0
Ida Andersen  Thursday tickets are all gone. We still sell all-week tickets (which  of course  gives you access to Thursday as well) and one-day tickets for Friday  Saturday and Sunday.,0
Max Petrén Bach Hansen  what kind of news?,0
Niels Otto  time will tell!,0
Morten Næstrup Mønster  Ra's playing in the period Monday-Wednesday and isn't included on this poster.,0
Adam Nilsson  well  technically Major Lazer is a group  -),0
Emilie Schrøder  have a look at Friday :-),0
thursday and saturday <3,0

Nikolaj Ask Petersen  have a look at Saturday :-),0
Aurélie Vigreux  if you're interested in Thursday - we still have all-week tickets available  giving access to all days including Thursday  of course. And you get close to 160 bands for that deal :-),0
Thanks for your answer Roskilde Festival !,0
because the poster tells 'manu chao la ventura' - does that mean he takes radio bemba with him? :),0
My bad. Nevermind  ),0
but i still wonder if the concert is part of a radio bemba-tour or something... would be interesting!,0
It would be amazing! :D,0
You have your ticket yet??,0
Emil Emil  S!vas is playing Monday-Wednesday - which isn't part of this poster. We'll reveal more when we announce the full schedule in May.,0
used to be diplo and switch but now its only diplo and the usual list of guest vocalists,0
well kendrick was way too big for arena..,0
See you there my friend!!,0
Saturday - because of Manu Chao,0
Major Lazer is a group of 3 peeps  Diplo is one of them,0
Yeah thats true. For arena concerts they usually dont know exactly how many tickets they can sell until they know how big the stage and so on will be. Thats why they sometimes sell extra tickets later. That wont happen with festivals.,0
Diplo will play a DJ set on Apollo as well. So yes he will perform two times.,0
Adam Vejstrup  trust only one source: www.roskilde-festival.dk,0
Hahaha I like how our posts are the only ones in English :) leggo!!!Michael Jacinto,0

Hello Roskilde!!  I absolutely love the first day of the warm-up  setting up camp  opening the first beer  and eating the first malnutricious meal :) But the last two years I have not been able to finish setting up camp before it was dark and cold :( is there a possibility that you would consider opening maybe two hours earlier so we have a little more time to set up camp?   Much love to all of you! <3,0
Hi Tanja. The opening time is not decided yet  and is influenced by one million factors  so the best answer I can give you right now is...maybe :-) Though I will pass on your comment,0
Maybe is better than no  ) thanks a lot!!,0
Volbeat  Sigur Rós  Kvelertak and Goat to play Roskilde Festival 2013.,131
DRUG HONKEY - Experimental Doom Metal from Chicago making their European debut at Roskilde Festival,0
Remember  only in the Agoras boys and girls...,0
When will you post some info about entrance booking or how you decide what to do this year?,0
We'll do that very soon,0
Not yet. But very soon,0
Check out our music blog and find out one of the bands for 2013.,3
They cant top this. Kvelertak is the best live act in business. Way to go Roskilde-Festival!,0
Nice one  now where are the rest?,0
You made the site crash.,0
Seems as though the blog was NOT prepared for this kind of traffic :-) ....and sorry. Will try to make someone kick the machine asap,0
I hope you will also book AC/DC  Metallica  Green Day and Blur :),0
And also Soundgarden :),0
Orangepeeling.com is by the way up and running again. Daft machines.,0
Did you just say  daft machines ? If that's not hinting for Daft Punk I don't know what da funk is,0
If we are hinting stuff  then we will hint you about the hinting - and right now we are not hinting you anything...just complaining about server issues - how not-very-sexy that may seem :-),0
seems very not sexy to me  but I'm happy with the first release so thumbs up! :),0
I looking forward to see this band next summer,0
Roger Waters are touring with The Wall for the last time. It would be more than awesome to see him on Orange.,0
The Wall tour starts in end of july and he will play in Parken. I saw this show last year in Paris and it was awesome but it is too big for Orange stage and i don t think he will come beacuse he will play in Copenhagen and only play stadiums sorry to say this dude,0
Well. There's always hope. Saw him when he did  The dark side of the moon  at orange  and that was fantastic. One of my best memories from Roskilde.  Anyway I'm going to see him in Oslo =D  (again),0
I saw him also at Roskilde in 2006 but Billetnet.dk says his show at Parken is his last show in Denmark,0

Hi Roskilde Festival. My friends and I have been discussing how will the entrance booking work this year? How do we know where to enter?,0
They have not told ud yet.,0
But we'll know in time  right?,0
We'll let you know more soon.,0
Hey Roskilde  I have a gift-card from billetnet but I don't know how to use it during the purchase-flow?  How do I pay the festival-ticket with my gift-card from billet-net?  Thank you!,0
ohoi .... when will the last few acts be released?,0
Foo Fighters are on a hiatus – Dave Grohl is in Queens of the Stone Age instead now. I wouldn't count on KOL either. That would require a new album  which they probably don't have time to get out in time before Roskilde.,0
When are You releasing The first bands of The 2013 lineup?,0
You'll know when you see it (I like your capitalization  btw),0
I figured I'd write a more detailed response to your tweet regarding streaming services.   I personally use Spotify because they offer a very impressive music library for a fairly reasonable price. I've used this service to share Roskilde-related music with my friends and I especially remember in 2011(or was it 2010?) when Spotify's  related music  showed other bands that were to appear at Roskilde. THAT WAS GREAT. Would love to see that function again. As well as themed playlists for different genres  created by your booking agents perhaps?   Some of the artists which appear at Roskilde are small  and I have sometimes struggled to find their music at youtube or spotify  making sure that they appeared at these channels would gain them a bigger audience I believe. Maybe you could get a deal with the streaming services to recruit your smaller  unknown bands to Spotify and such?  So I'm a fan of Spotify  are there other relevant streaming services? Personally I am not a fan of WiMP  as they are run by  Platekompaniet   a company which basically has a monopoly on the norwegian music industry. They really seem like corporate douches  however you could probably look for some of the same opportunities there.   Apart from this  I've tried Grooveshark  an option for the countries where Spotify is not available. Being based on youtube(I think)  they have a pretty impressive music library as well  but I don't think the service is refined enough to offer special Roskilde-options.  You probably know of these  just wanted to bring my serious opinion(unlike on twitter) to the table! Looking forwards to the quiz!,0
Ooh  transmedial message. How modern. We may reply on Google+ Just kidding  who IS online there anyway?  On a more serious note  thanks a lot for your input!,0
someone did make a playlist of all bands playing at RF for 2012 (and also 2011) on spotify. He wrote about in on the RF's own forum. I believe that he or someone else also will make a playlist for next year  when RF starts announcing the bads.,0
Sidenote: (Sorry  this post may sound.. advertising.) I'm preparing a playlist again  for 2013.  I think (hope) Forslund is talking about my playlist  -)  It started in 2010/2011 on Grooveshark  but since Spotify saw a release in Denmark in late 2011  I moved to their (far more legal) platform. Take a look at last years list here - as soon as bands for RF13 roll in  I'll delete bands from RF12 and start from scratch  so subscribe and stay tuned! :) 5 tracks per artist  all bands/genres.  Only problem is  as you are pointing out  smaller bands are not to be found. WiMP and RF has a collaboration going on  I'd only wish that Spotify could get some love as well.  )  Link: http://j.mp/roskify,0
Please help! I lost my camera in L  during my uni-project. It's a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ30. I'll really appreciate if I can at least get the SD-card back  since I have a lot of pictures I need for my project. Please help and share. Btw. Thanks everyone for a fantastic festival :-D,0
Videos and pictures from the av av av concert at apollo? anyone?,0
Ghost is touring europe.Roskilde has a terrible metal-line up.Book em´,0
I dont think the metal lineup is terrible though.,0
One of the worst ever.Been going since 92 and This year is really poor,0
And no Deftones is not a metalband,0
Wikipedia and just about every music journalist begs to differ: Deftones is very much a metal band.,0
But someone must agree with me.Deftones is a very strange booking.Popmetalband.rRoskilde need to reach out to me.I can help them with some good solid metal that people like and listens to.Every summer tons of metalacts tour europe.Famous acts wich play Every other festival But RF.That sucks and I miss the old booker at RF.,0
Deftones is not my favorite act and I must say that I miss  old  metal åt RF instead of New metal acts such as Deftones. As far what considered metal...well  some people consider Nirvana as metal...hmm  I beg to differ :),0
Old metal like Carcass? Plus Phil Anselmo plays material from Pantera and Rob Zombie plays White Zombie as well..,0
Sure nice acts.Rob Z is going to be fun.Bombus will be fun aswell.,0
Alexander.Are you satisfied with This years Line up?,0
Maybe  just maybe if the rumours about Sabaton come true  it could rectify the metal corner of the programme a bit. I'm just stoked about Deftones and the mighty Wizard.,0
Sabaton would be nice,0
But Ghost don't play metal?? Personally stoked about Nails and Mournful Congregation  along with the wizard and Carcass. Liking the line-up. It's all down to personal taste,0
Caracass?Are they famous in Denmark?If they would play a festival in Sweden it would be on one of the smallest stages.Have they played Denmark a lot ?,0
Maybe a metalfestival is more your thing. Copenhell  Wacken  Hellfest. Take your pick. Roskilde is not a metal festival.,0
Oh and I finally paid off my Flex Pay Roskilde ticket  so it will arrive in a few days I think? Now after so long  I will finally be back at ROSKILDE! Look for me  my furry pimp hat  and my plastic farm animals and T-shirts you can win!,0
Have you figured out who's playing at Roskilde Festival in 2013?   Then this quiz might be for you. The quiz is not necessarily about who you WANT to play  but who you THINK will.,3
what date do you start publishing bands for next years festival? :),0
Peter Jurlander  you'll know when you see it.,0
I like your style Roskilde Festival,0
I still think that Zac Brown Band should play at roskile. More country music at the festival would be AWSOME!! :),0
Zarah  remember  this is about who you THINK will (not necessarily who you WANT TO) play. A guessing contest.,0
Thank you  i will keep eyes and ears open!  This is who I think will be at the festival  this summer  the rumour said fire (new album)  the killers (new album)  muse (new album)  coldplay (new album)  white lies  klumben og raske penge (on a bigger stage)  nephew (new album).,0
Peter  remember to post your guesses in our forum.,0
Hey all thanks for a great festival! One negative thing though: my GoPro HD Hero 2 +  selfie stick  got stolen right in front of Gringo after Suspekt ?? If anybody knows anything pls write me  and if the greedy thief sees this  pls just hand in the SD card or somehow get them to me... Thank you motherfucker ??,0

Thanks to everyone for a great Roskilde Festival! It was a blast as always  even though I didn't get to hear that much of the music :P  For all those who took pictures of me  while in the Nicki Minaj queue  could you please either toss a link of them to me or send them to me in a PM?  I would love to see them all and would also love it if you could use the hashtag #BoratBoy on them  )  As you can see  I was the guy in the Mankini with the cowboy hat and the unicorn  )  Looking forward to next year!,0
Roskilde Festival is - of course - in our list of  Danish Spring And Summer Events You Shouldn't Miss!  :) All the best from Good because Danish.,0
witch day is Stevie wonder playing at?,0
Hi guys  i am planning to attend my first Roskile Festival this year. Unfurtynately i can only go one day :( Can you experienced guys tell me if sunday use to get sold out? Really would like to to use my  one day  on Stevie W and believe that it will be sunday  but not sure  so wont be the ticket yet  ),0
Dear Roskilde Festival  thanks for a great festival (as usual). I did have one very dissapointing experience that you need to fix. I arrived Thursday and was looking forward to using my Rockwool shelter that cost me 2200 DKK. BUT  you didnt have one ready. 60 min later you gave me one without the orange rainproof cover. We were lucky it didnt rain. Please fix this so noone has to experience this again!,0
We're sorry to hear about your experience. We'll pass on your message. And we hope you had a nice festival nonetheless.,0
Here is a selection of the live shots from the many concerts at #rf15,41

Please. Get. Modestep. To. Roskilde!,0
Check out this video from this year's The Shins concert at Arena Stage,2
Tenacious D would make me come only for that!!,0
this band is basically Orange Feeling condensed into people and it would be amazing to have them at Roskilde,0
Jeg leder efter nogle nordmænd som har boet i J  de boede i teltene lige over for mig.  Jeg kender nogle af deres navne  men kan ikke huske dem alle   Andreas  Leo  Monge/Ejvin  Jakob/ Jacob  og biggy  Hvis nogen kender dem  så tag dem i kommentaren   I'm looking for som norwegian guys Who lived in j  near our tent.  I know some of Their names  but can't remember all of Them   Andreas  Leo  Monge/Ejvin  Jakob/ Jacob  and biggy  If some of you know Them  please tag Them in a comment,0
Last Year you started a campaign regarding less speaking during the concerts among the audiences. I read about it in your  guide book  but didn't see it any other places. PLEASE make a greater effort  to get the message out to us  so we can enjoy all the concerts without all this background mumble. . Looking forward for some great new less known bands in 2013 bandlist. See You in 233 days,0
It's a difficult matter. We don't want people NOT to sing along during a rock concert. But at quiet shows (for instance at the Gloria stage) it's annoying for the majority that people are talking. Signs and campaigns can do a little  but not everything  unfortunately.,0
This year talking was a nuisance even at Orange stage  especially during Jack White  believe it or not. I get the point with having civil sound levels and all  but please don't turn into Way Out West  where at some stages  you could barely hear the goddamn music over the yammering of thousands of swedes and – digracefully – the other bands competing for attention at the other stages (!).,0
Jabbering is one thing. Sound levels is an entirely different thing. The sound DID seem low at Jack White's concert. The law dictates how loud it can be - but if the sound guy decides to make it even lower  that's not really something we can do much about.,0
I propose a little something like the against drugs video to show on the big screens before the concerts to remind people what they're in for. The concept could work like the little  shut up in the cinema  films they always show – heck  you could even get sponsors on board for all I care. The visibility of the problem was too low at this year's festival and the impact of it unfortunately too high.,0
Ofcourse people should be able the sing along  and ofcourse is it OK to comment the concert  but having a long conversation in the midle of a concert is NOT ok  even on Orange. The idea of using the  against drug  video is really good  but it's only visible at Orange and Arena. So use the info book and signs around the stages. At Gloria you should places a few guides  who circle the cloud and tell them to talk stop talking or leave. Gloria is a very intense stage so it's really needed there. It's difficult to move away,0
Big screen videos may work  but there are sadly a number of stages where no screens are present. The easiest way to solve the problem must be to go in front of the crowd. :) There you have all the fans who only sings along  and are committed to see the band. A good idea is not to stand in the background where more people don't know the band  and are less likely to shut up... Yes it's sad  but it's natural  i guess.,0
Yes it's SAD  but I really seet many bands whom I don't know  so we often stands in the back. I don't think it such a big problem for RF to do something about if they really want to. Last year as said before it was only a little note in the info book. Come on RF let's see some action for the silents in your concerts,0
Dave Grohl is back in Queens of the Stone Age and My Bloody Valentine are releasing a new album after twenty-two goddamn years. 2013 is going to be good.,0

It would be incredible if you decided to book Bon Jovi next year. I'd guess his price would be around 12 million kroner which is 1/5 of your whole budget as far as I am aware of. It is a huge amount of money but I am quite certain that it would be one of the greatest concerts we would ever see. Just quite unfortunate that his tour just stopped.,0
A pure scandal that you haven't booked PRONG. Just seen 'em @Lille Vega. Lost for words how amazing that was. Best cross over Thrash/Groove metal ever.!!!!,0
Hi Roskilde. I was wondering how 'get a tent' is allocated? I have a group that wanna buy a couple of tents but is there a way to make sure we all are close together without arriving together?,0

@Kristoffer: That quite well-known tune is for our Against Drugs campaign. It's a good and  sticky  tune  but alas not for Roskilde Festival as a whole and not made by the festivalgoers. Ps.

I find that it's an increasingly problem  that for the past 20 years people have been getting younger and younger every year. You guys should really do something  I mean it's like almost only kids coming now! When I was at my first Roskilde back in '92  most people ware my age. Except for the weird old guys  with their stories and whatnot. Anyway  I think you really should consider doing something about the kids!,0
Kim maybe you were one of the young ones once and the old weird guys thought that there were no-one in their age?  ),0
Kim  its all about where you are camping.. In the area i was camping 2013 there were alot of people 30++ years,0
Back in '92 a thing called irony was pretty big too  but tell that to the kids nowadays and they wont believe you  forcing you into sarcasm!  ),0
Could really use some tickets for my friends :),0
Roskilde Festival  who developed this new website? Looks very interesting :),0
Rob Zombie will play on Friday july 4 and Damon Albarn also. I hope they will not play same time  they are both at my Must see list this year :),0
I think both of them are playing on Arena :),0
My money is on Zombie at Orange Stage and Albarn at Arena.,0
Zombie is bigger than Deftones. At least if you use the very unscientific method: Counting fb likes. If Deftones are playing Orange stage (which they indeed are)  there is no way that Zombie aren't. At least as I can tell. But let's see.,0
Anders said one headliner is playing Arena.. Who other than Damon? :),0
Which of the headliners do you then think is Playing Arena? Anders Wahren said that one of them was going to play there.,0
Damon at 20:30 and Rob at 23:00? <3,0
No point in Albarn playing Arena  when they have no bigger names to put Orange.The last three years they have had a headliner playing Arena when the biggest headliner played Orange. If that's the case this year  then someone should play there when Stones play Orange  but that could only be Drake then ( but he is probably to big for that).,0
Probably the other way around. Zombie at arena  Albarn at Orange.,0
I m really sure Damon will play Orange  i saw Blur in 99 and 2003 at Roskilde and they play Orange. Damon is one of the biggest names this year.,0
Given how much he plays from his solo-record  how he doesn't really play any of the biggest Blur/Gorillaz hits and how little hype there is about him  compared to Jack White for instance  I think the possibility of him playing Arena is quite strong. You just CAN'T compare him alone to a Blur show.,0
But still i m sure he will play Orange :),0
I hope they will not play at the same time.,0
It probably says 29th because its the day the festival starts. Its a placeholder.,0

Some pictures from the raw video to be used in Roskilde - The Experience 3D after 2014. ,0
We would like you to give us your feedback regarding our line-up release.  This year we made a 4-minute video. How did you like this way of presenting the line-up?,40
It was the best presentation ever. Short and good. So please keep it short and simple in the future. :),0
I'd rather just have the poster.,0
Many of my friends were very affected by this video! I think it gave many people the last push to buy their ticket :) Very good job :),0
Fuck yeaher  Rolling Stones. :D,0
A plain list is so much simpler ...,0
The livecast from last year was far better IMO. I got the same level of excitement and joy as i would from Disneys Juleshow <3 Tilbage med den gamle!,0
I liked last years relase better. When Rikke resented a little bit about some of the bands. lastet around 45 minuts? we gathered at a friends house and hade a small roskilde pre-party with the release. For me it could be even longer  with a small presantation of every band..,0
I thought the line-up concept from 2013 with experts giving their perspective was really good  but it was too long. the presentation in 2014 was brilliant. perhaps you could make another expert video for us who likes a introduction to the line-up,0
I agree on the livecast from last year being a far more exciting line-up release! Also it was nice that the livecast was in the evening and at noon! :),0
I LIKED THE LIVE SHOW IN VEGA BETTER! :D,0
Way better last year  with a little story line and introduction from Rikke. This shorter version didn't have the same suspense as the year before. I like the idea of a more compact edition  but I miss the personal touch with the lineup release. Me and a friend gathered for the release  with a beer in hand and excited. We ended up a bit disappointed (Not with the lineup  which is awesome). Cheers.,0
Yes  short and simple is the way! Especially when you're at work —much easier to sneak out and watch a short presentation  than a long one like last year.,0
Love the videos in general - they put you in the right mood! But the full line-up broke on news sites before I could get to see the video - due to the heavy work load on the website at release :),0
I was really looking forward to a “documentary”-style announcement video—like the one the year before this. Was a bit disappointed by this  I have to admit. I loved how the 40-minute one took its time to present each of the highlighted artists/bands  and the video footage /with interviews was entertaining and exciting. Just my two cents :P,0
I couldn't access the video due to the high number requests on the website  so it made it pointless for my part.. and I just wanted to see the names.. the video from last year was epic though - where you describe almost every band and artist!,0
Eh  I like geeking out about music. I would prefer a half-hour plus discussion of the lineup.  If there is to be any product showing off the linup aside from the poster itself (or the website  which already has fine descriptions and clips)  it makes little sense to have video that just goes  STEWIE WONDER! ROLLING STONES! OUTKAST! BUY A TICKET!   just like the poster.,0
really good. I screamed when I saw Stevie Wonder :-) a dream come true!,0
Full of atmosphere! It gave me goosebumps (in a good way) and made me miss Roskilde even more. Good job :),0
Very nice varied line-up. I always hope for and expect like 1-3  legendary  bands. This time you've got The Rolling Stones and Stevie Wonder. So yeah  pretty damn awesome. But since I'm kind of a metalhead I really hoped for some more and bigger names near that genre. I think last year was just perfect with Metallica  Slipknot  QOTSA  Hatebreed and so on... :),0
The video is nice but i care more for background information of the bands on the poster. So content weighs more than how its presented.,0
You should consider upscaling your server capacity next year  or maybe hosting the event on a server that can handle this many visitors  eg. YouTube Live Streaming. The video presentation is nice and short and gave a good overview. I liked it.,0
I really liked last years video  but i also quick kind  trailer  you have this year   itis pretty nice. You should have both types of videos. The long one can maybe get you hyped about bands you didn't know before  and the short is a very good kind of appetizer to get people psyched about the festival in general. So both videos next year! :),0
Arctic monkeys is enough for me to come!,0
I agree with several others that last years release was better. It was nice to get a tour around the program with comments  music etc. It was also nice that it was in the evening so you could gather around in exitment as the program was revealed bit by bit.  Maybe you could do both. Have a real presentation video on your homepage in the evening and then afterwards release a short comprised one like this year afterwards.,0
I see now the info comes up when you click the names on the poster  thats what i meant thanks at the release wasn't possible yet.. Great work keep it up,0
I was a bit disappointed that I had no introduction to some of the smaller bands  I wanted to hear their music instead of just seeing a bunch of names I knew nothing about flying over the screen.,0
The livestream was wayyyy better,0
Great way this year  fast easy and surprising!,0
Wicked job dropping deftones in there!! Todd Clarkson check this out lets go! Angie watch this.,0
Video's are nice but this one took the site down...,0
I know that the headliners are the big draws  but people know their music  so it seems a bit superfluous to play their music in the video  rather than some of the smaller bands. And idea could be to make supplement videos featuring bands who could be grouped together  for example one for world music  one for metal  etc.,0
Awesome  it gives me the chills,0
Best line up in +10 years! Great video too! :),0
Last year was a great line-up. This year is not my cup of tea. Deftones and Phil anselmo and the illigals are cool though.,0
I agree with many comments above. I was expecting a live event  with the organizers presenting the bands  introducing them  explaining why they chose them  especially the smaller  non-mainstream bands (which I love the most!). A 4 minutes video is quite reductive. I really enjoyed the presentation 2 years ago  I think it should be like that every year. That said  see you at the Festival! I got my ticket from my friends for my birthday few days ago  yey!,0
it seemes like something other festivals do  Roskilde is not like other festivals,0
feels generic. the style was fresh 4 years ago.  Also  we are 10 names down the list before the first female name appear and the percentage of female artists all in all is very disappointing. ,0
The year you get kendrick imma buy to tickets ya bish,0
Must amid that the Line up doesn't represent me as a metalhead.   None or the less people have different taste. I woulden't say it's bad  but disappointing indeed. :/,0
Longer and more details in the video is funnier.,0
Great line-up! But i did prefer your way of presentation last year. I liked that you had comments on some of the artist and why they we're interesting! It made me look after some of the smaller bands that i didn't know (yes i am lazy because now i have to research myself - hahah),0
I liked last years line-up  but the problem was that we only got details and thoughts of a few of them. I would've loved an actual line-up that presents ALL the artists  genre by genre with the names under for instance. With clips and music. How long it is doesn't matter to me. This years line-up was exciting! I must say. It was nice edited and everything :D And the artists are great :) Looking forward to it! But maybe a bit too short of a video for an event that maybe over 130.000 people have been waiting for for a whole year :/ Keep it up  though! Cheers :I,0
Why didn't you play any of the more extreme metal acts' music in this video? Discriminating against the metalscene or what's the deal here? Afraid of scaring the regular festival participant away? Carcass is pretty much as legendary as it gets for a metal head on this years line-up. Besides that  the video was great  it makes me wanna go right now. And marketing-wise I think this will benefit you much more  than just having one long video explaining everything. Cheers!,0
Great line up:) have you considered to make a spotify playlist with selected tracks from each band ?,0
Everything said  i loved the release with Rikke at the wheel  but yes it was too long! This years release video was a nice little teaser  but for what? The festival? No. It teases you to dig deeper in to the line-up as Rikke did it last year. Maybe you could try to chop it up into smaller videoes with Rikkes commentaries and backstories. Fx. you could have a video titled  Headliners    Scoops    Unknown but Uncanningly awesome  or something more genre based. Its is true that this years video doesnt contain nearly the same amount of info as last year. Give the people a chance to browse the program hand in hand with Rikke or others  but being able to choose which part of the program they would like to explore. There are a lot of ways doing so.,0
Really good presentation and i can not wait to come to Roskilde again and it will be my RF nr 15 :) Since 99 to 2009 but i was not in 2010 and again in 2011 2012 2013 and again this summer :),0
Awesome! Thumbs up! Very good! And very annoying at the same time.... I really got in the mood for roskilde  and now I can't wait :),0
I just watched the video for the 7th time.. that most likely speaks for itself.,0
Dream scenario for next year would be that which someone already pointed out  both 2013s in-depth release and 2014s share-friendly videoclip. Getting info on bands from the bookers and knowledgeable people did really boost my expectations last year  in a good way. At the same time  sharing a 45 min vid is not something that creates a social media buzz  so both would definitely be best!,0
Despite the lack of progressive metal acts thats a little known  im really looking forward to the mixed programme,0
I would prefer if the line-up release were a bit longer with some back story on the bands. I had gathered up some of my school mates to watch it on a big screen and i must admit that i was very disappointed with this very short  stingy performance. I i were to improve the line-up release i would make it remarkably longer  with both back ground stories  short films from the festivals and such.  I see how it is a practical advantage for some that there is a short version of the film  because it is a clever way to spread the message around the globe and i would also like to compliment. But as i have already states it seemed stingy and i know that i among other would have preferred version that was longer and more in depth going.,0
Thank you all for your feedback. We'll collect all your comments and thoughts and take them into consideration for next year's line-up release,0
Couldn't get the videolink to work. Tried in different browsers  didn't work. Made me sad,0
This release video is very elegant: it respectfully presents the great variousity represented on this years RF. I look forward to the party IRL!!!,0

Do the car parking tickets -east  usually sell out? or is the free parking just as good?,0
I don't know about the sales  but the only difference between paid and free parking is AFAIK the distance between the parking space and the camping site. The paid parking is right next to the camping site  while the free parking is a good walk away.,0
Parking east has been sold out some of the previous years. Like Anders says the difference is the distance you have to walk,0
Thanks for the reply !  so the walking distance i what i pay for ..or not pay for :) I thought it was higher security at the paid park..,0

Roskilde Festival is more than a week of “all-night-partying” – when and how do you feel most relaxed during the festival?,2
Get my festivalburger and go watch a movie in the cinema..,0
Setting in my camp and justing beeing in the now.. no worrys or thinking about what I have to do,0
When i'm really hungover  and there's no clouds in the sky  and it's too hot to exist  and a soft breeze finally cools me down a little  i usually fall asleep instantly. After that quick nap  i'm ready for anything!,0
The most relaxing moment is when you realise that you can be whoever you want and whatever you want for the rest of the festival. It's like releasing a reset-button in your mind + beer  which can take a few days to realise... doesn't get eny better than that exact moment,0
Smoke a joint and eat a pizza,0
when all me friends look like they are in total bliss...,0
Its more than 20 Years ago  when I was there  but I remember like it was yesterday! The most relaxed Moment was  when we arived at the Festival Ground and have our first Beer and so on...,0

Hi Roskilde  do you still run the DIY-competition where you can win tickets and a GoPro? I can't seem to find the competition on instagram any longer.,0
Nicolai You got it! That's the blank spot for you guys to fill in  -),0
how so?,0
It's funny.. I feel the complete opposite  every time I hear that tune  I get reminiscing chills of the exciting anticipation your body holds just before Bon Iver/Sigur rós/James Blake/Kalkbrenner/whatever hits the first note!,0
im pretty sure i know the guys at 1:30,0
I only have good things to say about the tune :) I love it!!!,0
Best Roskilde tune ever... Never change it!!!!,0

Does anybody have a Spotify playlist to share with all the artists? :),0
Try the search function in Spotify. There's several official and unofficial.,0
aah as easy as that! :) Thanks for the tip!,0
They don't have the system for that announced yet.,0
I want to give a  one day ticket  as a birthday gift for my wife to Stevie Wonder  but I can't see in the program which day it is??,0
The schedule isn't ready yet and usually isn't until mid June.,0
If people have bought a ticket to see the Stones and they cancel again. Will people get their money back? ,0
No they will not  that is the terms that Roskilde Festival's ticket provider has,0
Sorry  we can't issue such refund guarantees.,0
I think that would give very big problems. Hardcore Stones fans don't accept just a subsitute. Which name could replace the Stones? And for the age of people  who loves the Stones your program isn't anything. Oh yeah if you like relaxed soul Stevie Wonder  but he isn't really worth that kind of money! Floyd and Zeppelin (or in worst case a Kinks reunion) would what could replace the Stones.,0
You havent bought a ticket for The Rolling Stones  you have bought a ticket to attend Roskilde Festival on a Thursday. This include 5 stages with music  lots of arts and culture  restaurants  bars  people  atmosphere and much more. If one band is cancelled  no matter how big or small the band is  it will be replaced by another band. Up to 10 bands are booked each year  to replace possible cancellations  they are not announced and most of the time they don't get to play  but they get the experience of attending the festival  just like you do with your 1-day tickets.,0
Before you buy the ticket it says that refunds will only be available if the whole festival gets cancelled.,0
Who cares what hardcore Rolling Stones will accept or not? If they got a problem with the way a festival  any festival  is different than a dedicated concert  they can just... you know... not buy a ticket.,0
Unfortunately  it's not working properly. We're building a new one.,0
Ok  thanks for the answer...,0
Emma is readying her 'must see' Roskilde line-up list.  Who's on YOUR list?,5
This is a good taste of Roskilde.,0
Barbershop Quartet with a Roskilde song. From Roskilde - The Experience at Roskilde Festival,0
You only have three more days to have a say on who’s to play Roskilde Festival 2013. Follow the link and make your requests.  http://bit.ly/BandRequest2013  Photo: Christian Hjorth,21
You have to book Blur  Green Day  Metallica and AC/DC to Roskilde 2013 :),0
Use the link  and forget ac/dc  sadly they dont do festivals....,0
Green Day and Depeche Mode please,0
Pff. Just read this http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/johnson-burned-by-acdc-cannon/ And the veteran singer says the band would consider making more festival appearances in future after breaking their own rule to play the Download event at Donington  UK in 2010. They will play more festivals on next tour and never say never. I have use the link and i will still hope for acdc to play roskilde :),0
Florence + the Machine,0
Tenacious my god if u get them u dont need any other bands Teeeeenacious D so fi for roskilde,0
App is broken. It will not allow me to Submit,0

POETS OF THE FALL FTW!,0
Roskilde or Glastonbury needs  to get David Bowie,0
Why even bother... It seems like you don't give a shit about what we want ! Because you know we are all junkies of The Orange Feeling ! Well  see ya next festival,0
Jimmie  whoa  that's not true. We DO give a sh*t  in fact. We use your requests as a tool in our booking work. However  it doesn't mean that we automatically book whoever's in the top 20. Remember  it's not a popularity contest.,0
Chef'Special  The Netherlands!,0
A british SKA-band like the Simmertones from Plymouth would be something different //,0
We like YOU.  Last Friday we reached 150 000 'likers' here on Facebook. On this occasion we've made an infographic that says something about you  dear Roskilde-goers.  Thanks for sticking around.,8
HAHAHAH JAAAR! \m/,0

Jethro Tull are awesome :),0
Accessories? Which accessories are we talking about?,0
Caps especially and T-shirts :),0
There's no such thing as sold out - not permanently  anyhow. We can always go back and stock up more. But it CAN happen that we're temporarily out of something.  Btw  we're soon having a sale as we need to clear the shelves for 2011 merch - so watch out for good prices in our online shop soon.,0
What about 2012 ? :D,0
Damn  it must be weekend soon. I meant 2012  of course.,0
ahh...... i will then  :D,0

font nightmare - why didn't you go all in and add some comic sans ...,0
Yeah Atle - I liked the limited edition of one and so I paid a fortune for it on ebay and it still didn't really sit right -),0
Nezar  let it grow on you. You'll see more of it. And btw  it's just one font (besides the text in the logo).,0
yes  i like this...!,0
My name is not Tobias either.... so why do I get this sent to me?....,0
My name is Saleh Aldehaim                                                                             I will send you my details via my yahoo e mail address to your e mail address :  info@roskilde-festival.dk                                                                     All the best and looking forward attending your next year festival ,0
Love the orange color .... my old roskilde jersey is worn out  wish me exactly this .... Please  <3,0
This is so unfair .. He should bake a cake for the 149.999 others who made it possible,0
Chill  people  chill! :O it's just a t shirt...  ),0
Malene  this is our new font. And where's the grammatical error?,0
Malene  actually  it says both. It has a double meaning  and that's the intention. The Times font was in use for 2012 but will be replaced for the festival season 2013.  Maybe the font for the mark will change as well  but that hasn't been decided yet.,0
What the hell does IRFFPTTITT mean? You guys are the worst ever at writing hidden messages. Shame on you.,0
Albert  haha - perhaps it's not the first diagonal line of letters you're supposed to look at. Maybe it's an entirely different code that hasn't been cracked yet.,0
How are YOU feeling today?  Design made by Roskilde-goers Adam Ryde Ankarfeldt & Thit Refn,13
Orange :D,0
banana!  IT'S FUCKING COLD!!!,0
Orange :D,0

I feel like a nice pair lol xx,0
knock knock who's there? banana! banana who? Knock knock Who's there? banana! Banana who? Knock knock WHO'S THERE! Orange! Orange who? Orange you glad I didn't say banana?,0
I just bought 15 bananas and 4 mangos  I feel kinda banana,0

Rune Barkholt-Spangsbo  this was a design submission for a sticker contest we did earlier. It didn't win  but we still dig it!,0
No All of the Above? Tutti Frutti!-) Is it true that one year the RF stages were Orange  Pear  Banana  Mango  Hallon and so on?,0
IM BLUE! Dabidi Dabidy... - nah just messing with ya.. IM da middle round  orange one... ^^,0
I'm feeling very pære today,0
What the hell? Is this some kind of hipster art? Actually  this post made me feel fucking sick. Not banana. Not pear. And not fucking orange. Sick. If this is made in to a t-shirt i get cancer. I swear to god  you will give me cancer. Why not shit in a can and call it art? Oh wait  thats right someone did it. So you used fruit. Jesus fucking christ.  Design ? No. A picture of fruit. And some random text that makes no sence at all. Not art. Not design. Fruit.,0
Dennis  take a chill pill. It's just a little Friday fun.,0
Well its pretty ugly! But banana,0
Kinda Banana... But next summer  i'll feel orange for sure!,0
Orange you glad i didn't say banana =),0
Watch this live video from last year’s concert with Icona Pop and get in the right mood for a Friday night.  We love it!,0
This year's concert?,0
Tobias  right you are. As you can tell we're fully in 2013 mode - all planning and scheming!,0
Outcast on thursday. Stevie is unknown,0
Yeah. He will most likely play sunday,0
Or Saturday??!!,0
It's pretty certain Stevie doesn't play Thursday though.,0
Its not decided yet. Usually the program is complete in june.,0
Well on their webpage they say that Thursday is sold-out and that's the day The Rolling Stones and Outkast is performing  so I guess it's decided now...,0
Thank you!,0
It's not. Roskilde Festival just chose to reveal which day those two are going to play. The rest of the schedule is not sorted yet. You might find something here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/lineupartists/2014_schedule/,0
Trust the FAQ on Billetnet. Children's tickets (10-14) are for sale at the entrances and only there (and they never sell out).,0
I have already read that  but it still doesn't answer the questions about pricing and the exact rules for their entrance!,0
Please contact Billetnet about this matter.,0
hope you send a bracelet to people directly next year,0
Sorry  we don't work that way. Wristbands are collected on site.,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPXJg1DLb34 I can not wait to see The Rolling Stones :),0
The band schedule is not ready yet  so we can't say where and when everybody's playing yet. We'll keep you posted.,0
Ok  impossible to buy a day ticket then :/,0
We were overwhelmed by your reactions Wednesday. Here are some of them.  https://storify.com/roskilde/line-up-release-reactions,10
Haha you are so funny,0
Yeah - my tweet made it !! #rf14 - pure love!,0
One day you MIGHT get a line up as good as Glasto...!  ) https://www.facebook.com/glastonburyofficial/photos/a.10150183961960964.301221.40513090963/10151925138815964/?type=1&theater,0
How will entrance booking work this year? Do we also have to pay for that? I'll be coming from Paris :),0
Okay so no response yet....! Træting one more time! IS THE WEEKEND Playing with DRAKE or Not,0
Fantastic line up Roskilde! See you on the 29th of june!,0
A poster with Manic Street Preachers missing - c'mon Roskilde Festival do better  do it right and do it right now!,0
BRING THE WEEKND!!!!!!!',0
Mimimimimi.... :( we'll have to wait for next year... Wendy Runderkamp,0
This is my reaction cuz Tool isn't in the lineup: ????????????????????????,0
See you this summer  my Roskilde Festival number 15 :),0
Great way to find your  must sees  :D tanks,0
Thanks! We do our best.,0
Just a humble suggestion if the handful of missing names aren't completely decided yet: Why noy invite Ry Cooder? He made an excellent live-album last year  but he can't afford touring anymore. And you are a bit short on americana compared to the previous years ,0
There are so many great acts out there - but we can't fit them all in.,0
Would it be possible to upload the full size print pdf of the poster on the homepage since you don´t sell the poster in the merchandise stands at the festival any longer?,0
Here you go: http://bit.ly/RoskildeFestival2014,0
Awesome! Thank you.,0
Drake? Haha what,0
(I can get) Satisfaction from this line-up!,0
Coming from El Paso for the festival.,0
Wow - in my opinion the best line-up since 2006 when I went for the first time!!,0
I have to say that this is a year  of  must see  and not want to  see ... I am utterly amazed that out of 160 bands there is not a single one that i am dying to see... I normally don't consider myself a picky music listener  but to me this is just a year of:  oh well i better go ... I don't mind having my horizon broadend but everything i have been looking deeper into this year is just not that intresting...  This is truely an amazing line-up no doubt about it  but come on man  it almost seems like these names are being booked out of a  we want to sell tickets  mindset and not  we want to challange your consert / music experience  which i love so much about Roskilde...  But that is just my thoughts and i can see that i am pretty far off compared to the general mood amongst the festival attendants.,0
Alx Arth amazing line up this year,0
Drake the type of nigga to high five you with both hands and lock fingers.,0
Camp Mordor is already planning next year's Roskilde Festival. What is the name of YOUR camp?,18
What is your best experience at Roskilde Festival's skate park?  The world's first skate park with a built-in DJ school has just opened in Cambodia with support from Roskilde Festival. Read more here:  http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/donation-skating-with-a-soundtrack/,12
All we can say is that if you know you're going  better get a ticket before it's too late.,0
In need of a soundtrack?  http://bit.ly/RF14Soundcloud http://bit.ly/RF14Youtube,21
Hasse Frederiksen  throw us a link  please (if he's there  that is),0
Does this mean......... Manu Chao is coming to Roskilde Festival? :OOOOO,0
Can you please make a playlist for google music. :-),0
this is a very bad playlist you have prepared and i really think you should be ashamed of it.,0
Here is his Spotify page: http://open.spotify.com/artist/38322CAyy6I2qYaGqluMkV  And here is a good song from him : http://open.spotify.com/track/2F6zJ0ARqC1ZbV1itvncjB,0
Mikkel Skov Madsen  feel more than welcome to share your own playlist.,0
Hasse Frederiksen  consider it done!,0
We'll leave that to you guys :-),0
i'm on it!,0
Lucy Love is right! Why haven't you booked a female artist to open Orange stage since Anne Linnet?,0
I know i asked the same thing a while ago  but now that all artists has been announced  could it be possible to update the app? Its artist list is a bit more practical than scanning the poster for  artists and information.,0
Got any questions about the 2014 line-up?  Our bookers are ready to answer them between 14 and 15. Post your questions as a comment to this post. Fire away!,5
COME ON R O S K I L D E !!!!!,0
More than 10 000 Roskilde-goers have already requested their favourite bands for Roskilde Festival 2013! Do you have an urging request? Submit it here: http://bit.ly/BandRequest2013  Photo: Steffen Jørgensen,23
i have  but for visitors. - reduce your trash!! did you ever heard for something called ''ecology'' at all? - (i was at roskilde festival this year and it is really disgusting how much of the trash people leave there),0
The killers & the kooks,0
Biffy Clyro  At The drive-in  Bombay biclycle club  blur  Black keys  Primus!,0
How about some decent hip hop this year? Snowgoons? Cypress Hill? Nas? Maybe even The Wu-Tang if were lucky?,0
The Kooks & The Whitest Boy Alive,0
Paul Freeman. His first real album is out next year  but he has some EPs at iTunes. Worth a listen!!,0
Rage aginst the machine  the black keys  metallica   system of Down.,0
Why don't we just all put  Rage Against The Machine  in the number 1 box. Let's see if Roskilde finally gives in.,0
Scorpions are touring in Europe next year........ !!!,0
What's the use of this  if in the end the lineup is as weak (and completely different as requested I bet) like last year? Will you show the result of this request? A Top 100? Then we will see how many of them you really get playing at Roskilde 2013.,0
Saw RATM in '96 which was AWESOME! Would love to see them on Orange again!!,0
Daft Punk  Teddybears  The Offspring  Headhunterz  Netsky  Le Castle Vania  Streetlight Manifesto  Reel Big Fish  Agnostic Front  Lemonheads,0
Oliver  the use is that we actually USE your input. It goes without saying that we cannot fulfill everyone's wishes. Another important point is that this is NOT a popularity contest where we automatically book all acts in the top 20. The 97th most wanted artist can be equally important.,0
Neil Young's new album is going to be released next week! Please get him! Lovely music! <3,0
But Depeche Mode are playing in Copenhagen on June 13,0
is this the Usain Bolt show?,0
Roskilde Festival  thank you  I understand this  of course RATM  Metallica  AC/DC  Depeche Mode and so on cannot play & be paid the same year...  -) But still the result of your request would be interesting. I am sure it will show the good taste of the audience (except of those Eurodance-Boombox-terrorists.).,0
Roskilde Festival I hope you will bring some of the rock-giants to the festival this year! But it's gonna be a fantastic festival no matter what ( ,0
The schedule is not out until later. We'll keep you posted.,0
What the first toilet visit at Roskilde tastes like!,0
Please book Blur to Roskilde 2013. Blur are playing at Rock Werchter in Belgium in the same weekend and Blur will be awesome to have for Roskilde Festival 2013 :),0
Just because I was there =) http://youtu.be/E6_Stv2aQgY,0
Hej. I have a suggestion... Could we please focus this year on the fact that people TALK too much during the concerts?? I don't think I need to explain it  you all must know what I am talking about... :) How can we fix this??,0
i'm getting so exited!!! I wanna go now!!!,0

Max  Drake will be there. Both on Facebook and at the festival  -),0

Dear Roskilde Festival I have already bought my ticket but I really must say as a metal fan that this years metal line up is really really weak.I can´t find one major metal act this year.Sure Rob Z but he is not all metal.But we have a couple of moths to correct that mistake.,0
when is the app going to be up?,0
Why not Depeche Mode ?,0
They are playing in Copenhagen on June 13. I don t think they will play Roskilde also,0
We still need your vote for best festival at European Festival Awards. Follow the link and show your support. https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/efa2012   All voters enter the draw for two tickets to ALL award-winning festivals.  Thanks a bunch in advance!  Photo: Steffen Jørgensen,16
If you get Muse I will vote for you!,0
Get Daft Punk! And give Blitz the Ambassador a spot for the second year in a row. Greatest concert I've ever been to! But I have cast my vote for you already anyway! (Dave Matthews Band is nr. 1 on my wishlist though. I wish for Dave Matthews Band every year. 1996 Can't be the only year on Roskilde),0
only if you promise to put focus again on the program as you did until 2010...,0
This picture turns me in to one big goosebump,0
My last remind of my Roskilde Fest bracelets :(,0
Not much left. Which year is this?  You'd better come get a new one in 2013 :-),0
1998... a teacher suddetly decided to cut the 2 bracelets (97 purple and 98) around my wrist. Then they felt in a locker hole where nobody could reach them... sad story...,0
If you pay my plane ticket I'll be able to go  ) That would be more than joy: pure pleasure!,0

The Roskilde Festival 2014 poster! Which act is your favourite?,239
Roskilde Festival: This year will be my tenth festival and therefore anniversary. I started in 2003 and since then  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13. You have had a huge impact on my life! All those hours of joy & fun + many moments of surprise  you have given me. In 2003  I ONLY saw the one band that made me go  Metallica. A shame it was  and many and more times  I have regretted not seeing more bands back then. During the last many years  you have  forced  me to dive into the sea of music  you give us every year. This festival is an event  that gives me loads of positive energi for the rest of the year. It is the best place to get reminded on  how much love and joy  once place can contain when everybody are there for the  same  reasons. Even though we can not marry  I hope for a life-long  marriage   ) Looking forward to waive our  Grannylove  flag in front of all the stages this year. Thank you for the best event during the year. Thank you for yet another fantastic line-up - see you SOON! Grannylove <3 from  Bedstefar  ,0
Stones  Haim  Arctic Monkeys  Stevie Wonder  Damon Albarn and Manu Chao. Those will be a blast. I guess theres always a whisky bar i can attend while Major Lazer is  playing  Otherwise  i have to admit there is a lot of unknown stuff. Who knows  maybe i'm just getting old  ),0
Is it possible to see on which days the individual artists are playing? Can't find it anywhere...,0
Would you mind telling me where on the website I can the see the whole festival programme? Who's playing when? only the headliners are scheduled.,0
Where has the forum on the website gone? ,0
Have you seen - Stevie Wonder is playing Roskilde Festival? - Cause he hasn´t! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zXDo4dL7SU ,0
Sorry  we're still working on the details on this and we can't give a specific date yet,0
If you wish to camp in the area of P  what entrance is it? :),0
Anyone - just set up your tent in any area near the fence and you´ll be sure to slaap en P :-D,0
Well I recall the festival has certain entrances for reasons  and I am not going to crash le fence so.. :),0
It was a joke P =pee,0
But then which entrance is the correct one for P?,0
Dont know - just being funny. Good luck.,0

This is our Roskilde !,0
This is what Malou Anna Petersen thinks Roskilde Festival taste like,0
Please let my dream come true and bring  The Pack A.D.  to Roskilde next year! It would be awesome to see this bluesy garagerock girls  ),0

Hello Roskilde! First of: really sweet lineup! Second of: I saw that DIPLO is put as an artist for him self. Does that mean that he will be giving both a solo concert  and one with Major Lazer? ,0
Yes! He'll do a show with Major Lazer and a solo DJ set,0
SWEET!! Can't wait to visit your beautiful fields of mayhem for the fourth time.,0
It ain't ready yet. We'll let you know as soon as it is...,0
Where can i found information about the program (bands) ob Saturday  5 July? ,0
The poster as PDF...,0
Is The Horrors comming or not? Cant find them on the poster but stands so in my mail I got! ,0
The taste of Roskilde is the first sip of your beer once your camp has been set up. This year I missed out on the festival for the first time since 2005  and by sheer coincidence I passed through the city when the festival opened. I seriously broke out in tears - and all I could think of was that first victorious sip  signifying the moment reality fades and is substituted by Roskilde  that I would be missing out on.,0
The classic bread-mackerel-mayo combination  topped with some Pringles (secret ingredient) and rounded off with a bunch of lukewarm beers. That's how you survive in the camp.,0
Not really  no. Instead just spread the word. This is our contribution to chefs all over the world.,0
You are an inspiration for us all Louis!!! :),0
You decide if you want to sleep one  two  three or however many people you can fit in there. They just need a normal RF wristband,0
Thanks alot - I think we will stick to two :),0
I wanna see them next year at Roskilde Fest :)))),0
This is what Roskilde Festival taste like for me. It's a classic! It's madpannekager at Mama's <3,0
:) and that...,0
This is the best meal I've ever had at Roskilde Festival - in the Media City. I wish I could have it again.,0
The taste of Roskilde,0
I won't call it food  but i think it describe it well for me.  Bacardi Rum + the candy called  rådne fisk  : sweet  sour  highly intoxicating and good  all in the same time.,0
My Festival Taste Like:,0
Jelly beans taste! Just to get things started!  ),0
This is what it really tastes like!,0
Dear roskilde festival  I love you so much. But you really need fail over servers so you don't get DOSS'ed when you announce the line up :),0
The true taste of Roskilde,0
Hello there  Last year there was an volunteer initiative with all the left over food from the festival. Something about cooking for homeless people. Will that return next year? In that case  who should i contact?  Kind regards Mads,0
Please contact info@roskilde-festival.dk with your inquiry. Then we'll make sure the info gets to the right person.,0
Roger that. Thanks :),0
Hot  spacy and fun,0
A fictional plant?,0
Only something fictional can truly capture the inexplicable taste of Roskilde Festival.,0
This is the line-up for Roskilde Festival 2014! Share with your friends.  Tickets: http://bit.ly/RF14ticket,828
Manu Chao :D,0
Nora Bjerregård Øland Milena Milanovic WATCH OUT FOR THIS,0
Which day is Stevie Wonder??,0
I was awake at 5:50 (New York time) to be ready for this...and I am very happy.,0
Øh YES?! people always moan about the music every year... I'll take everything new i go see as an experience. Great thing not to being able to feel tied to one kind of music ^-^,0
Roskilde will be awesome as usual. But were is the big metal act?  I am probably to young or to old to see it,0
When will Arctic Monkeys play?,0
No punk rock again? Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,0
Is it true that The Rolling Stones might be cancelled? :-),0
Non profit since 72 ? Havn't you always been saying it was since 71 ?,0
sorry to say but this is one of the most monotonous line up that has been to roskilde festival in years,0
Love the line up guys - when will you announce days/times for this year?!!,0
Evie HonzikFern Jenner waaaaaanna go so bad,0
We'll let you know as soon as possible,0
I would guess he is on sunday :),0
Deftones are the best! :D,0
Lukas Hviid Topp + Janne Jensen Qvortrup -> http://youtu.be/U50TFgERFEs,0
Janne Jensen Qvortrup  http://youtu.be/U50TFgERFEs,0
We're happy to hear that  Alyssa!,0
Peter Petta Thoren We believe Deftones is a big metal act. Tomorrow we'll do a Q&A with our bookers right here on Facebook and you can ask them any question you'd like,0
Punk is dead  deal with it.,0
If punk was dead  you wouldn't have 25.000 people attending Groezrock each year. In fact there have never been more (and better quality) punk rock bands than today.  People who say that don't know what they're talking about  )  Try look outside Gaffa/Soundvenue and you'll find them. Or just listen to a song - any song - by Rise Against to name but one band.,0
June as usual,0
Thanks Peter! We are tough negotiators,0
A few extra acts will be added,0
It's a bigger puzzle. We'll let you know as soon as possible.,0
Lærke Grønbeck No. The Rolling Stones confirmed their Europe tour a few days ago: http://www.rollingstones.com/2014/03/31/14-on-fire-europe-14-shows-in-may-june-july-2014/,0
We can't say when yet. Stay tuned,0
Here's an answer for Kanye West at least: http://soundvenue.com/musik/2014/04/qa-med-roskilde-festivals-programchef-jeg-er-ikke-ked-af-at-vi-ikke-har-kanye-92518/3 If you're interested the bookers are doing a Q&A right here on Facebook tomorrow at 14:00,0
Daniel Danielsson we're very glad to hear that! If you want you can tell the bookers how much you love them tomorrow at 14:00 where we'll do a Q&A right here on Facebook,0
Still working on the music program.,0
So.. Still room for Massive Attack and Slowdive  I suppose?,0
If you have questions about our line-up you're very welcome to ask our bookers tomorrow. They'll do a Q&A tomorrow at 14:00 right here on Facebook,0
Thanks for the info  will do :-),0
Julie and Ida  We can't say yet. But we will let you know as soon as we can,0
Lars Højberg We are still working on the full music program.,0
Hannah Winther we can't tell you yet since we're still working on the music program,0
Stefan Thorsvang Petersen the festival started in 71 but it was first in 72 we got non profit,0
Apperently Roskilde is now to hip to bother with hard rock or metal...not a single headliner but two hip-hop and two electro...sigh And no arctic monkeys don't count,0
I am usually not one of the biggest screamers when it comes to   the band list sucks  and  not enough metal  and stuff like that. And I will not be this year either. The line up  I am sure is greate  but more unknown names for me the usually. But thats okey.  What I do have a problem with this year is understanding the compsition of the band list. Under will follow a list with top genre top artist and higest ratet song on spotify.  Rock band: stones - 20 mill Indie band: artic monkeys - 45 mill electonic band: Major Lazer - 30 mill hip hop band: Outkast - 20 mill soul/pop/r&b band: Stevie wonder 18 mill Metal band: deftones/rob zombie: 4 mill  Is it just me or is there a big jump in  hugeness  from the biggest bands in the other big genres to the biggest band in the metal genre? I am a metal head so of course this bothers me. I know we had 3 big metal bands last year in metallica  volbeat and slipknot  But come on. This is a big glip in the band list in my opinion  unless you have something big up your sleve the nest months like last year with metallica.,0
Stefan Thorsvang Petersen  first year was probably a bit chaotic. Two high school kids starting up something. In 72 an organisation  what we know today as Roskilde Festival Charity Society  arranged the event. (very simple version),0
Mental line up...,0
They had three metal headliners last years though.,0
We can't tell you yet  but we'll let you know as soon as we can,0
We can't tell you yet. Stay tuned,0
Still working on the full music programme.,0
Benjamin Borup we are going to produce more thorough films regarding some of the acts. These will be launch when we get closer til the festival.,0
Mattias: Four if you lump metal and hardrock together. And even more subheadliners...,0
Still don't know which day is Arctic Monkeys?,0
Petteri I think it is a calculated though unspoken decision by the festival not to book acts the attract uncontrollable groups of people such as punkers. And belive me I miss punk and dirty rock n' roll  and the people that come with it at the festival....,0
Rolling Stones = Cheap because of THE Orange stage,0
Benjamin: I don't know if you were at the NOFX show a couple of years ago  or at Against Me! or Anti-Flag at previous years  but I wouldn't exactly call punk rockers uncontrollable. You're thinking of the 70s  that type of punk doesn't exist anymore neither as an ideology nor as a style.   It's a shame because these bands always fill up the stages they play on. (Bad Religion was an exception  but who puts that on Orange??),0
if the first word you post is  sorry   then do not post at all.,0
so i cant give criticism without being nice?,0
thats the spirit. If you go to a concert and think it is booring  there is always something else to go and listen to. That is the worst case scenario :),0
Hotter than July and Paint it Orange,0
Yea  if something doesn't seem me  I'll just walk away. It's not really like I'm trapped at the concert xD,0
you say you are tough negotiators  Roskilde Festival? then get us daft punk..,0
You'll be doing D of E though :(,0
This is the line-up for Roskilde Festival 2014! Share with your friends.  Tickets: http://bit.ly/RF14ticket,223
any idea when your website will be online again ? Sitting waiting for the line up :-),0
 They really pulled up The dinosaures this year!  - heard at lunch.,0
Thank you so much Roskilde Festival!!! This year you have created a line-up that fills out almost every demand! I am really looking forward to this years greatest party!!!! <3,0
It tastes like a juicy Chesseburger..,0
You Fat Pork !!!!!!,0
Roskilde to me is like an orange mud cake :P,0
I can almost guarantee you that it's not going to happen  ever. They just put tickets on sale for four exclusive concerts in celebration of (yet another) greatest hits compilation. Tickets that cost from 2x a Roskilde ticket and upwards. They've become a bunch of insanely greedy old bastards.,0
In Denmark they’re called ”Klumben & Raske Penge”. In English that means something like “The Lump & Healthy Money”. Despite the funny name you should check out this AWESOME dance-hall duo performing at this year’s Roskilde Festival!,3
Jesper and Jeppe so true  if you translate literally it's healthy money but if you translate the meaning of the words together it would be something like easy money.,0
This is what Roskilde Festival tastes like,0
obviously it tastes like orange and beer?,0
Roskilde tastes just like watermelons~ yummy,0
Leningrad Cowboys are going to play Sweden Rock Festival 2013  it will be awesome to have this band also to Roskilde :),0
Once more into the geek-zone! We have sent an expedition of friendly volunteer geeks to Essen  Germany  to  orange-up  SPIEL  the worlds biggest boardgame fair (150.000+ participants). Here they are presenting the Camp Roskilde boardgame  the Festival DICE Game and generally nerding up the place. It's on from NOW and till Sunday  so pop by  -),2
It has become a lot easier to request your favorite bands since 1994! Submit your requests throughout October  and have your say on who’s to play at Roskilde 2013. http://bit.ly/BandRequest2013,12
I used to run that shop in Copenhagen :-),0
There is some history about it here (in Danish): http://www.pisserenden.com/ejendomme/sankt-peders-str%C3%A6de-39/,0
Carlsberg!? Weird times  the 90's.,0
Carlsberg owns Tuborg. Same Company. Tuborg is been Advertised for the young and Carlsberg for the Mature.,0
Carlsberg also advertises for football.. how is that mature?,0
you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about Sigmar  sorry to say. Both carlsberg and tuborg are probably the best beer in the world!!,0
It's all about branding. If you really think it's about the taste  you're really gullible.,0
Why not have the same bands as in 94 aswell.Great festival year!,0
Let's just put things straight. :-) Carlsberg owns Tuborg  yes. Carlsberg was official (and  I think  since 1992 main-) sponsor until Tuborg  took over  in 2002 ( and nothing would ever be the same ). Thomas is right  that the decision about which of them sponsors what events mainly comes down to sports vs. other (particularly music) culture. Finally  they're also both really poor excuses for beer.,0
The submit form doesn't work :/ After I filled it out and press the submit-button nothing happens?,0
Michal  have you liked the page first? That's step 1.,0
Yes I have. Still doesn't work,0
Pete Doherty or meeting of the Libertines as Reading- Leeds 2010   It will be wildness and wonderful  and I would Like to listen to Keane....,0
voted for Ab-soul   Death Grips   Mogwai  Das Racist and Grizzly Bear!,0
Page not found?,0
Jews for Christ ! Thats it !,0
Beautiful sight. Looking forward to it.,0
Very Nice,0
Can see my flag!,0
Camp Brian has arrived and is ready to be placed in front of our LEGOlized Orange Stage. How many people live in your camp each year?  Want to send us YOUR mini figure? Read more here: http://bit.ly/XmlR2v,17
lol there is my zombie cousin,0
its my camp!,0
I would guess that we are somewhere between 15-25 residence each year. These are the once that is always in the camp. The rest changes every year.,0
My camp as well  and I came up with our name  which originally was  Alle hedder Brian på Roskilde  ( Everybody is called Brian at Roskilde ) :D,0
Morten is so nice that you've sent your entire camp to us. We'll make sure your camp gets a prime location in the camping area in our LEGOlized Roskilde Festival world!,0
Best camp ever  besides my own.,0
So nice Morten. Übercool,0
Festival kunst :O),0

True or false? The pee by the fences can be traced 1000 years from now.  Answer: You've can find the answer by following this link: http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/aviser/2007-0704_dk.pdf  Photo: Esben Thommesen,16
The huge ammonium concentrations should be traceable  yes.,0
true  probably  but there is a difference between whether it is traceable and if that makes a difference,0
So true!,0
next year I want to be a peeing dinosaur too,0
Wait  what? crashit played the Roskilde this year? Amazing...,0
if not even a million years...,0
...depends on what you had,0
Well of course. It contains carbon.,0
and...to be honest...I don´t care,0
As far as a brainpickers go that is a honeydickel. I guess we will have to wait and see. But no matter what - Since my vessle both run on and is build mostly of water I'll try not to skip my annual waterchange next year neither. Will it make me run for a 1000 years to check up on your question?,0
Especially when It's dino piss...,0
You Can still smell it in a 1000 years from now..  ),0
False. You will not be able to differentiate between the 1000 year old nitrogen atoms (that will most likely have leached out or returned to the atmosphere anyhow) with the new ones. Because these fences will still be urinated on during the Roskilde festival a 1000 years from now!!!!!!!,0
I read the festival newspaper on 2007  and it stated this subject as TRUE.,0
true  at least since I peed there after our fruit punch nights  ),0
False! The Earth will explode within 1000 years from now!,0
So  we  should be  paranoid about time travelers from the future?,0
So what is the truth? Is there an answer ?,0
So true! u can take a swim by those fences if ud like :P,0
The dino pee you can probably trace millions  of years from now :P,0
I went to reading festival this year and literally didn't see a single person peeing against anything other than urinals  it was amazing (but smelled much nicer  I must say). Maybe I'm getting old and boring  but I didn't miss it one bit.,0
I wonder what people are going to think happened there  if they trace such a specific pattern of urine.  It's probably going to look like some kind of religious ceremony took place or something... I guess it's not that far off really is it?,0
Well folks  it certainly is not about the answer ...it's all about the dino haha! :P,0
that's me in the dinosaur suit.,0
That's because Roskilde 3012 will still have people who don't know what the urinals are for...,0
According to an article I read in the festival paper in 2007 this is true.,0
The 2nd trailer for Roskilde - The Experience 3D was just released ! https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=368641159879758,0
What's he saying?  Photo: Kasper Fladmose,2

Rage against the machine,0
 Gonna pass that over here soon? ,0

 This joint will get you high as fuuuck ,0
Since the world ends 121212 at 1212  RF 2013 will equal RF 1  and on other old business  nearing total world dominance on all areas and aspects make sure to stock up on cold fresh øl!,0
To beer or not to beer? That is a stupid question...,0
I'M ON DRUUUUUGS!,0

I SHAVED MY BALLS FOR THIS?!!?,0
Shit's on fire yo,0
ohh  this thing was fucking great!,0
...and is gonna be my lego figure infront of the orange stage...,0
 This tent needs more naked people so we can get it to smell right ,0
Sorry  we are out of beers...,0
 This is not the droid i'm looking for. ,0
AND THE RAAIN FAALLS DOOWN IN AAAFRIKA,0
We're out of beer! Could anybody please bellydance to get us some beermoney!?,0
 I wish i was naked in here  that would make up for a better speak bubble. ,0
In my hand i got 86 straws... whoever gets the short one  goes on a beer run.,0
probably asking anyone to do a random almost impossible task  and if they sucseed they get a free case of beer . i think,0
Ok which one of you nicked my deodorant? Everybody stays here until somebody talks!,0
Welcome to AA meeting  my name is Poul.....,0
today's mission is called getting beer...... so you whit the red bag go and get it rest of you drink it,0
Alright people. Due to the apparent t-shirt crisis  we will start distributing t-shirts to everyone who misplaced theirs. Please do not loose it this time.,0
You had all of our  liquor  beer and  tobaccos. It stopt raining... so would you please get out of my tent now!,0
What I'm saying?  Punkt 4! ,0
 Dude  this licorice drop is AWESOME! ,0
 But hey  c'mon I have a condom ...,0
**do you have smoke??? *,0
Could you please book Sigur Ros?,0
Blur @ Orange stage in 2013 ? PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN :),0
Ps: i saw Blur at Roskilde in 99 and in 2003 but in 2003 it was without Graham Coxon but he is back in the band now :),0
Wanna spend your lunch break with us?  Tune in to Facebook at 12:00 CET for our line-up release,68
Anna Anna Maria S. M og Julie Christophersen!!!,0
WHAT A AWESOME LINE UP  MATE!,0
Here's a little greeting from our bookers ahead of the big day. Tune in to Facebook at 12:00 CET tomorrow to watch the line-up release.,20
Will it be a live transmitted press-meeting and is it possible to ask questions on Twitter  during the session? Or will it be a video-stream like last year?,0
pretty please. with sugar.,0
Oliver It will be a video that we release right here on Facebook at 12.00. On Thursday we will do a Q&A session with the bookers (also right here on Facebook)  where you can ask all the questions you'd like. More info on that will follow.,0
Emil  this year we've chosen a (way) shorter presentation of the line-up for you guys.,0
How long will the video be ?,0
A (way) shorter presentation than normally,0
Emil agreed. But we like to do things in new ways  so this year we will try a different approach. Hope you'll like it.,0
Hi Karoline  thank you for the question. Our bookers will be answering questions right here on our Facebook-page on Thursday  so please tune in then.  - And glad you like the line-up so far!,0
karoline  if you understand german  in this article there are some answers to your questions...  http://www.wecab.info/2063-das-geheimnis-deines-erfolges-wie-laeuft-das-eigentlich-mit-dem-booking-beim-roskilde-festival/,0
Thanks Esther! My german skills are... well  I'll definetly give it a shot  ),0
Hi  I would like you to book the band X(X the official band page!) but how do I and those with me who would like to see them request them on the band request page? Or will every empty box filled with an X guarantee a vote for our favourite band? That would be great!,0
A good point - and certainly a detail we didn't think about. Our suggestion is that you write 'X (the band)'.,0
Book AC/DC to ROSKILDE :) ? Please. And the veteran singer says the band would consider making more festival appearances in future after breaking their own rule to play the Download event at Donington  UK in 2010. ,0
Recommendation for Roskilde Festival: Netsky Live! in 2013. Netsky rose quickly through the Drum'n'Bass scene  with his dancefloor smashers such a 'Mellow'  'Memory Lane' and 'Secret Agent'. He's truely the goldenchild of Englands biggest d nb record label  Hospital Records. With two albums on his resume  along with countless remixes and neverrealed singles  he's mustered the courage to be the first drum and bass artist _ever_ to make a full-on live set. Ever since  he's been playing in sold out avenues in Belgium and England wit this set  and i strongly believe it is time to ask him to join Roskilde 2013 for an event of epic proportions. For a taste (or actually a full length) view of what i am talking about  watch the video attached. Much love!! Roskilde is great. Netsky is great. Together they are..? Let's find out!,0
Couldn't agree more!,0
At this year’s festival the opinions on whether to watch football or go to concerts were different. But what’s the opinion today? – Is your evening meant for music or watching the World Cup qualifications?,0
F*** football against music!,0
going to a music festival to watch football is like putting on a wetsuit when going to the movies,0
I'm going to band rehearsal of course.,0
This summer Janelle Monáe played a great concert at Arena. But who do you think should play at Roskilde Festival next year? Remember to request your favourite artists here: http://bit.ly/BandRequest2013,7
SHOTGUN REVOLUTION :D ,0
Jane as police woman!!!,0
Red hot Chili Peppers were great at Rock in Rio - Madrid. Would be a cool choice!,0
my bf has just said abt goin next year :) happy days x,0
You won't regret it! Where are you from?,0
We welcome all Brits! First time?,0
A little something to warm up with: http://youtu.be/elW4YKQPRac,0
my bf went to roskilde 6years in a row in the late 90's to work. b nice to c where he worked :),0
New Roskilde-goers have arrived and are ready to be placed in our LEGOlized Roskilde Festival world.   If you were at Roskilde right now  what would you be doing?  Send us YOUR mini figure.,13
Propably working in a service tower or on the ground... and enjoying every moment of it :),0
I would wonderland why there  only was a big park with no stages. Then I would go home and wait for the festival to start :b ,0
I would be playing games while getting hammered  ),0
not sure i can find a figure that can fit an adequate amount of props in the form of cigarettes  my trusty G&T  randomly aquired flags  funny hats and other random shit + 1 boot and a flip flop. IF you find one  place it ontop of a big tent full of female figures wearing a sense of  WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU  added a laughing neighbouring camp. YOurs sincerly  me.,0
I would jerk of..,0
being at gringobar !,0
I would be drinking right now  while playing some kind of game. Or just be at the camp  looking at people. But I know I would be loving every second of it.,0
I would be drinking a beer  and then more beer.,0
we would have a beer  what else? http://distilleryimage8.s3.amazonaws.com/0572855eb0b111e181bd12313817987b_7.jpg,0
you ain't getting my stormtroopers  Vader or the tiefighter pilots. If you beg long enough  I'll send you a photo. As for Roskilde  I'd be at Gringobar. Where else?,0
What is the gringobar?,0
I'm in Roskilde now  studying the shit out of coding c ,0
sleeping it off  like i dont give a shit!,0
Mikkel your wish is hereby passed on  if someone knows anyone from the alien humping cow camp  you could pass on the message,0
Malte follow this link and find out: http://www.gringobar.dk/,0
The dumbest project :-(,0
Michael  why? It's crowd-funding in the most literal sense. We like it.,0
I would be listning to Green Day on The Orange Stage  while enjoying a cold beer  :-D,0
...if i was at roskilde right now... i would probably be cold  and try to get into the middle of the crowd in front of orange to get at bit of heat,0
RF: please start booking now: there are a lot of interesting big names who already have announced festival tours for next summer and are starting to be announced at other festivals  so get into the game and start booking some of them  while they still are available... booking headliners in March is too late  especially now with Copenhell and Northside also competing for big names within their genres.,0
Our music group is in the game throughout the year  so don't you worry about that.,0
I hope the music group will book Green Day  Blur  Metallica and AC/DC and Kiss :),0
But Rammstein will only play festivals in 2013 but i m not fan of them,0
Hey Staff! I just saw an old RF13 pic of my friends and me  so I wanted to share it with you! :D,0
Hi  When will the day where Arctic Monkeys plays be announced ? :),0
Who won the major lazer contest ? :),0
http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/black-sabbath-australian-2013-tour-confirmed/ Maybe also Europe and maybe also Roskilde :),0
Sorry  can't help you there.,0
Is Roskilde Festival the best Festival in Europe? We are nominated as 'Best Major Festival' and 'Line-up of the Year' at the European Festival Awards. Follow the link and give us your vote. https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/efa2012   All voters enter the draw for two tickets to all Award-winning festivals.,5
 Line-up of the year ? Hahahahahaha! Good one :),0
Roskilde in the category  Best Line-up  must be some kind of a bad joke...,0
Roskilde  don't listen to the complainers. Keep on gong just as you always has done. That means booking all kinds of music of all kind of sizes. If somebody wants a mainstream festival  let them go to one. Roskilde should never aim to be more mainstream and populistic.,0
Will be hard for Roskilde to win votes against Tomorrowland (my vote is definitely for RF),0
*SARCASM ALARM* Yeah   Lineup of the year   so THAT's why i chose not to go this year  it was the best lineup  yeah that must be the reason.,0
do you have any polls of what is currently the most wanted bands from your vote?,0
It's not a poll or a popularity vote. So we don't reveal the sum of the incoming requests as we don't want people to think that we will automatically book whoever's in the top ten. Think of it as input and inspiration for our booking group where a band with 35 requests can be as interesting as one with 1000 requests.,0
yeah i know that i ment more for the fun of it  just too see who people want to go :D,0
Please Roskilde  book Blur to Roskilde Festival 2013 :),0
You can go to the forum: http://roskilde-festival.dk/forum/mm_forum_pi1/posts/rumours_hopes_wishes/band_request_part_1/ some ppl have post what they have wished for... join the fun,0
A trip to this event in my home country that you all simply have to experience. :) Find the story here:  http://wanderersoftheworld.org/?p=200,0
Thank you for the kind words!,0
Line-up release is tomorrow. Are you ready?  Tune in at 12.00 for more than 60 new acts and the full #RF14 line-up!,68
Is it all of the remaining bands  which will be announced  or will there be announced a few additional bands after the poster release (like in the last few years) ?,0
Mads We've made a video - but that ends most comparisons with last year. It is very short and the tempo is high. We can't wait to share it with you guys tomorrow. Right here on Facebook!,0
And they are not going on tour.,0
No  the lineup will be ready tomorrow  so this is not a joke.,0
They announced this days earlier,0
Christian We will have to wait and see  -),0
damn that's specific!,0
I think Honky Tonk Woman should be there also and It s only rock n roll  you got me rocking and brown sugar also :),0
Well  we would have loved to include those songs as well but they can't play all night - Charlie needs to be in bed by midnight. But don't worry  I'm pretty sure they'll play at least Doom and Gloom  Honky Tonk Women  It's Only Rock'n'Roll and Brown Sugar.,0
how much does full tck cost ?,0
Wanna try and guess who we'll announce for our full line-up? Follow these two not very easy steps:  1. Go listen to our old radio and see if you can catch something at http://radio.roskilde-festival.dk  2. See if any of the bands you think you're hearing would fit in this poster:,33
Arctic Monkeys is one of them,0
Rage Against the Machine! :),0
is these letters only from already announced bands?,0
Artic monkeys are not good enough to headline.. Damon's had a lot of great music but   solo is not a headline... Dissapointing,0
The first small name (After T TE L = Trentemøller) is Darkside(US)! Also two very quick samples on the radio.,0
Rage Against The Machine!!,0
Eels would be awesome! They are available thursday & sunday - And nearby: Playing Belgium & Netherlands in the beginning of july,0
Imma die if you announce deftones!!!!!!! Like die.. in a good way <33,0
pearl jam neil young deftones faith no more,0
My god.. They could announce fucking Jimi Hendrix and Michael Jackson back from the dead to play on Roskilde - and people would still be dissatisfied... Rolling Stones and Outkast are playing - ease up!,0
Please announce Editors! Has been a long long time since they played Roskilde. Fingers crossed there is still some place between Dilated Peoples and Haim!,0
If they announce Deftones I will........soil myself!,0
A bit thin on the headliners  2 unknowns   and they are lower than Damon and Outkast. On the other hand there are space for some of my other choices... still hoping.,0
I'm traveling from Panama to this  can you guys tell me which day is going to be the Arctic Monkeys ???,0
The Beatles!,0
Thinking after Kavinsky might be: Kes The Band from Trinidad/Tobago feat a bunch local artists?,0
Deafheaven said they were announcing 40 shows this week.. space between Deerhunter and Dilated Peoples?,0
U2 is starting their European Tour on the 6th of July in Copenhagen. Venue TBA.,0
BASTILLE???????!!!!!! (y) (y),0
So the band that headline Glastonbury 13 can´t headline Roskilde - oh and have headline before.....,0
nope  it's mixed.. Also some already announced acts with no letters (Nails for example),0
Worst lineup Ive seen at this festival imho. Only outcast and stones are proper headliners so far. The rest are at best afternoon bands.,0
Jack white headlined a few years back  and he did just fine.,0
What? Where?,0
If you listen to the  radio  at 2 minutes and 40 seconds I'm 99% sure you hear the chorus of Firmament..,0
Where do you see that?  :),0
Tom Morello is touring with Bruce Springsteen so no RATM!,0
Only two names worthy of headlinerstatus imho,0
Wtf mate.. not good enough?!?!,0
jack white is about 1000% better than anything on that poster except for Stones.,0
oh my god yesss,0
Pauline - muligvis Bastille! (Y),0
don´t even say that! now i´m expecting all those great names you just listet...i can now only get dissapointet xD ',0
Indeed they could :) Have tried to fit Eels and Exodus between Dilated Peoples and Haim xD,0
Deftones could also fit between Deerhunter and Dilated Peoples :) Could Cü be Cülo? You have done nice job!,0
So any suggestions for bands that should come instead or do you just wanna cry about it?,0
Thank you Juha :) I have been looking for some longer names for that spot.. but it could be two names there..,0
Eels has 6.7 free so it's possible. Also Elbow could be one  but I don't know what would be after that then.,0
Mogwai (uk) could be possible between those two M letters in those small bands. If you know what spot i'm meaning :),0
And actually they could fit also after that second M letter.,0
Dont see that happening when Tom Morello is on tour with Bruce Springsteen this summer.,0
Only until may 18th!,0
Lower than?? It's alphabetical (with the exception of Rolling Stones...),0
I suggest two names on the same line. Daft Punk and... Aaand... Bal Arne?!,0
He is gonna perform hits from both Blur and Gorillaz.,0
I can die satisfied  if RATM headlines Roskilde... just saying,0
Yes they have  Thursday 3rd July,0
Lets roll with that  that makes a place for Eminem :-),0
The band after  Dark Buddha Rising  has to be  Dengue Dengue Dengue!  Peruvian band: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi49IeO01lk,0
com from sunday to the next monday- then you are sure not to miss out on anything. and believe me  once you are here  you will regret to have only a few days and not the whole week.,0
Im sure i will regret it  thanks for your help :) Do you know any good/ not so expensive  hotel to stay near the festival area?,0
Bruce Springsteen will soon anounce his European dates for the summer so Tom will still be unavailable for RATM.,0
Or at the same Festival  ),0
It's alphabetical  so no.,0
Pearl Jam won't play at Roskilde Festival ever again. You know why. Neil Young plays in Copenhagen this summer  30 July  so he is also very unlikely.,0
That would also necessitate that they played five days in a row which is very uncommon for touring bands of The Black Keys' pedigree. Do not count on them.,0
They're playing at Copenhell  so they seem unlikely.,0
Except that they're too small to be headliners in any capacity...,0
Not touring,0
ah Major Lazer! I'm so excited for this haha,0
System of a Down som metal hovednavn..!! :D,0
As much as I want it to be RATM  the clip at 2:39 is half-tempo in comparison to Township Rebellion. The sound of the snare is also way too violent.,0
They've just been announced for Voxhall – a single gig in August. I expect there to be a Copenhagen gig too  but I don't think we'll se them at Roskilde.,0
You can't define taste. There is no such thing as good or bad music.,0
Probably showing my age... I was at Glastonbury last year  and although I've enjoyed Arctic Monkeys when they were fresh  they weren't a headline for me. It needed Prince  or Bowie or somebody . Same for Mumford and Sons  great set but needed that extra special headline on the night from somebody legendary :) .. there's as many sides to a story as there are people telling them.. personal preference is all .. I've been to so many festivals now I'm getting hard to please ! :D hah,0
And he never played at Roskilde before.Each year I hoped he would play.Maybe this year?,0
No they're not. You're looking at tourdates from 2001 – the 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' tour. So unless you have a big honking time machine  you're out of luck  -),0
Well  it's still 1st of April after all :P,0
Yeah  saw that as well - a shame.,0
Les Ambassadeurs feat. Salif Keita  Amadou Bagayoko and Cheick Tidiane Check from Mali it is  ),0
wear a diper :),0
Can't be.. It's alphabetical :) But Darkside fits right after Chromeo,0
too big,0
or just Paul McCartney! :D,0
I know the cheapest - buy a tent  have a party :),0
Tag yourself and your friends  if you were there!,11
Love Eriksson Upload issues. We're working on it.,0
There you go  Steen!,0
Green Day and Blur to play Rock Werchter 2013. Please book these bands also to Roskilde Festival 2013 :),0
Can't wait for roskilde 2013!!!,0
Did you get a haircut in Poor City this year?,0
yes i did!,0
SKAF MUMFORDS AND SONS :D !!!,0
Just printed my ticket (yay!) and am really looking forward to summer and Roskilde Festival! Now  will you refund me the 100 kroner your half-page photo on the ticket cost me in ink?  Unfortunately  I have no choice but to pour a litre of ink on the page  since I must  Present this entire page at the event .   Someone didn't think this through!,0
You've got a point. We've put a photo on the ticket so make it a bit more decorative when people put up their tickets on the wall  the fridge etc.,0
I see what you mean. But I think the days where the concert tickets themselves  were special and worthy of keeping are long gone.  Pink Floyd in Parken '94 - now that ticket is another story completely  -)  BTW  I think it's fantastic you respond to feedback in here! :-),0
Like this (though the scan/photo is a bit faded),0
Electronic tickets next year maybe? Sweden Rock Festival tickets supports IOS passbook for instance so there is no need to print the ticket. You have your ticket in an app instead.,0
A curious question: I´ve been going the last 16 years  but I don´t remember the festival being sold out more than twice (the Prince-year and the Roger Waters-year)  even though the rumour pops up every single year  and for obvious reasons people are aready talking about it this time again. If we´re talking from  say  year 1998 and forward  am I remembering correctly?,0
We've sold out most years in that period. Maybe you haven't noticed because you got your ticket in time? :-),0
Seriously? I´ve heard quite often  when I arrived  that the tickets just sold out  but it seemed more like rumours than anything else  so I figured  that it was a rare occasion,0
Have the tickets been sold out more than a month before the festival any of those years?,0
This is just awesome.  Well done Politiken!,69
This is just awesome :),0
Yes water- smoke - on the water - do it,0
When can we set up our tents  if we haven't bought a spot? :) And where? ,0
You can camp in all the light green areas on this map. Regular camping  which is included in the ticket  covers a BIG area.  http://roskilde-festival.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/2014/RoskildeFestival2014Map.pdf,0
Awesome  I presume the Agoras are there too? for cooking and such?,0
Indeed they are.,0
Orance Scene in minecraft. ( work in progress ) If anyone wants to join Roskilde - The Experience's minecraft tekkit server. just let me know.,0
Kiss to play Sweden Rock Festival. Please book them also to Roskilde :),0
Yaerrh Please do that!,0
Kiss are awesome live  i saw them in Malmö in 2010,0
KISS at the Orange stage would be fucking crazy!,0

Who would you like to see at Roskilde Festival 2013? Have your say before it’s too late and request your favourite bands here: http://bit.ly/BandRequest2013,6
Greetings Roskilde!   I have just submitted my requests for the upcoming year's festival   and seeing as you (in my opinion) have a fairly audience-friendly approach to social media  I wished to add some less likely or a tad more experimental wishes on your Facebook-page. I am hoping you will forward these to the people in charge of booking artists :)  First of all  I considered this option last year  but found it to be too unlikely to  waste  a vote. Seeing as I greatly enjoyed the Patti Smith concert in 2010  I wanted to find ways you could continue the tradition of legends in this taste. I have limited knowledge on what solo acts are considered legends  so I started going through the 60s music I listen to  looking for some bands with a powerful front figure. The band that first sprung to mind was Jefferson Airplane  led by the beautiful Grace Slick. I did some research on this  and it seems that sadly  she has left rock music. I would however greatly appreciate it if you would look into her doing an exception concert  seeing at that would be a dream come through for me  and probably a lot of other people!  My second addition is someone I simply forgot  and just remembered. I enjoyed the concept of Apollo  yet I would have liked to see some more established names within the relevant genres. This does not just go for the Apollo stage  but for the entire festival of 2012. I have wished for two electronic names using my votes ( Daft Punk and Doctor P) and would like to add a unique name of dubstep  who continues to innovate and touch other genres. Borgores  gorestep  is what I would consider some of the best  musical  dubstep out there  using great vocals and somewhat controversial lyrics. He really singles out within the dubstep world  having background in metal and stuff.  The reason I chose to write a small essay about these artists  is that I believe they are both artists who fit the Roskilde formula very  well  and therefore demand an explanation. I hope you share this view and someone will perhaps look into it.   Best regards  Sigurd Moe Nyquist,0
I will vote. On here ,0
It's working fine here. But thanx for the advice.,0
http://www.nme.com/news/blur--2/66477 Please book Blur to Roskilde :),0
No!!!!!!,0
Yes. Many people want them to Roskilde. I m one of them. There are 7 to 9 headliners at Roskilde every year :),0
Wouldn't be a bad booking  but a quite boring one  since they already played in Denmark and Sweden this year. I caught them at Way Out West. Great show  but they'll have to come up with a new album to make a repeat worthwhile.,0
I want Blur to Roskilde 2013. My first concert ever was Blur in 1996 :),0
Damon Albarn is half Danish  maybe the reason why they want to come back to Denmark next year :),0
Damon isn't half Danish.,0
Yes he is. I heard it from hardcore blur fans,0
They don't know what they're talking about. Both Albarn's parents are English. His grandparents or great-grandparents could maybe be Danish  but his mum and dad are from Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire  respectively.,0
But still i hope they will play Roskilde. They are one of my favorite bands. I saw Blur in Iceland 96  Roskilde 99 Roskilde 2003 and Copenhagen 2003 but in 2003 Graham Coxon was not anymore in the band but he is back and i hope i will see them again next year :),0

And I just did. :) See you!,0
We've travelled around the World and brought back the best we found.   More than 30 countries are represented in this year's line-up.,8

Please please add Kate Bush to your line-up.,0

Hey Roskilde Festival I have been trying to find some more specific information about the tent+gear option you write about at your homepage. What kind of tent? Size? What kind of sleeping bag? And so on. Also I haven't been able to locate where I could buy this option if I wanted to. Hope you can enlighten me.  Looking foreward to my 13th year at the festival.  Best regards Thomas,0
If you got to our 'ticket' page and click 'merchandise + add-ons'  you can buy the equipment in there.  We've not put too much info on our page as it gets very long.

Have you liked the page first?,0
I haven't.  I do  like  the Roskilde Festival  and I try to encourage my friends to go every year  but I don't use my Facebook for advertising. So naturally I get a bit obstinate when I'm demanded to this. So I would like it  if it wasn't necesary for me to advertise your page in order to submit my wishes for next years program. This has been possible in the past years.  Also I think that if you limit your audience feedbacks to come from people willing to like your page  you might miss out on feedback from some of your audience  including me. And I'm guessing you would like to get as much feedback as possible to analyse and determine the wishes of your potential audience.  I hope to see a possibility of submitting my wishes for next years Festival without having to  like  your page. If so  I might  like  it once the bands start being announced  and when I  myself  decide to like your page  not because I'm demanded to.  :-),0
Couldn't you just like the page and then remove the like after you've submitted your wishes? It's not like they will disappear into thin air  if you do so.,0
Check it out =),0
We're thinking Mumbai (http://mummbai.dk/). Could that be it?,0
If not try the APPetizer (download free from app store). Here you can see all the 2012 food places.,0
It was outside of the festival  so I am not sure if it was official  I'll check the app,0
Can't be Mummbai. They served Indian food  not Thai or Chinese.,0
Wasn't Mumbai  it was outside of the festival,0

Writing down our wishes for Roskilde 2013 is  for us adults  rather like kids writing to Santa Claus. Very exciting! What will the man with the white beard deliver this year?,0
Have just discovered that the wonderful Kid Creole now lives just outside Malmö. So booking him would be just like getting in Wilmer X: a local artist. A must-have for 2013 in my book! He's a wonderful thing  baby!,0

The video Amok på Roskilde (that is now taken down from server) was made by Eyelight production  they usually make the videos for Roskilde Festival. Probably the video was ment to go viral witout being officially endorsed by the festival. But now it's gone from YouTube and also from Eyelights own channel. I say  Let's go viral with a statement about how misogynist  homophobic  hateful and normative this festival is. Musician friends  boycott! Danish friends - artists working for the festival  don't go this year. Yeah  they usually only program about 20% female/trans*musicians anyway... ,0
We agree. This video conflicts strongly with Roskilde Festival’s values – and it was not meant to see the light of day. What you saw was a draft published by mistake in a third-party channel – this video has at no point been published in our own channels.,0
What steps are Roskilde Festival taking to combat (among other things) misogyny  homophobia  and racism? While the video was obviously staged  people like the character portrayed in it are in no way a rare sight on festival grounds.,0
Well  I'll continue in english then: The fact of the matter is  the movie is still circulating. Yes  in a poor quality cam-version  but good enough to get the gist of the movie (and all the awful details). It doesn't seem well thought through  not adressing the issue in a more thorough manner.,0
The video was made by a company that produces much of your PR videos  right? This is what I have heard. I find it very hard to believe that this could go as far as to be posted on YouTube without anyone from the festival knowing about it. What I saw last night is still hurting. Someone has to make an official appology to me and many others. This video was still commissioned by Roskilde Festival  isn't that so?,0
Line Lee Sky Walker  we're kind of double posting (there's another thread as well. Anyways:  This is the only production they've done for us - and when we saw the result we didn't approve in any way. so  this video should never have been published. We didn't like the content and we're sorry that it has upset you.,0
When people experience problems  we have a team of social workers who can help.,0
So nothing to actually prevent these things from happening.,0
If people don't know what's up or down in the case  it's much more fitting that they catch up in the commentary track here. It would just add to the confusion to make a broad statement about something that hopefully will never see the light of day again because Roskilde didn't sanction it in the first place or approve of its contents.  It's baffling how a video production could get so out of hand before it was stopped in its tracks  but I could somewhat easily imagine a scenario  where the production company has just been given a small advance and a loose briefing about making  something that could go viral .   If the festival didn't see anything before this shitty draft/end result/call it what you want  that's not just unfortunate – it also exhibits extremely unprofessional behaviour by Eyelight – on top of their blatant lack of understanding what the festival is all about. But their unprofessionalism shouldn't be turned into the festival's problem.   (I don't work for Roskilde  btw.),0
Nikolaj Munk  we don't have guards at Roskilde Festival - other than service guards  no. But the police are present as in other  cities .,0
Sara Ferreira  what is a 'thorough manner' in your opinion?,0
I was thinking more in terms of education  outreach  public statements  you know  actually letting people know that you don't condone this kind of behavior. A lot of the guests (and some of your service guards  judging by last year's commotion) don't seem to have gotten the memo.  But having guards around to keep an eye out for stuff like sexual harrassment might not be such a bad idea. You should look into that.,0
Nikolaj Munk  we do info meetings for alle our service guards. And if they do see something  they report it to the police.,0
That's a start.,0
You asked me a question  I replied  and then: silence! Is there a particular reason why? I feel my questions are both valid and constructive.,0
Sara Ferreira  sorry  too few hours in a day with all the planning for Wednesday's line-up release on top of this.  We understand your concerns and your point of view - but atm we have chosen not to act further on this matter.,0
Ah  I lægger låget på med en tandløs floskel -  We understand your concerns and your point of view - but atm we have chosen not to act further on this matter - og håber at mennesker ikke snakker videre om sexisme  homofobi og Roskilde Festival?,0
I just watched a trailer for Roskilde Festival. It's called Amok på Roskilde Festival. I find it extremely misogynist  homophobic and disrespectful of people other than white young men.   This video is offensive and insulting  I feel deeply hurt by it. Watching parts of rips a hole in my heart to tell you the truth. Its like taking a giant step back in time  loosing things that I was hoping for was no longer at least NOT okay to say in public in Denmark.   Like for instance saying that gay men are disgusting.  Honestly  what kind of statement is this to make for a music festival in 2014?   I think that Roskilde Festival  the people that put this trailer out there  should be very ashamed of themselves. And I think that you should take this misogynist  homophobic crap down from your channels right away.  And finally I think that you owe a lot of people who has danced  kissed  fucked and loved across genders and sizes at Roskilde Festival during the years a BIG apology.   I think that you need to wake up and realize that the cool and amiable statement to make as a cultural producer today is to take a stance towards oppression of various kinds.  Not the opposite!  If Roskilde Festival don't promptly make some changes I  suggest a CALL FOR A BOYCOTT of this party where me and many other people obviously are not invited. ,0
The video was made by a company that produces much of your PR videos  right? This is what I have heard. I find it very hard to believe that this could go as far as to be posted on YouTube without anyone from the festival knowing about it. What I saw last night is still hurting.

Line Lee Sky Walker  this is the only production they've done for us - and when we saw the result we didn't approve in any way. so  this video should never have been published. We didn't like the content and we're sorry that it has upset you.,0
Roskilde Festival  you mean it's the only production they have done  lately  ? On their website there is another video from 2011 about the  naked run .,0
Jörg: That one wasn't made for Roskilde Festival  but for Bryggeriforeningen  which is the official interest group for Danish breweries  of which Tuborg/Carlsberg is the biggest. They're Roskilde's main sponsor  which is why the setting for the film is at the festival. I don't think that the festival has had any say over the content of the  naked run  film because they weren't the client.,0
Mads Mikkelsen  who works for Roskilde  has been adamant that the festival did not sanction the video. My best bet is that it was made without the festival's knowledge at all. It would be an odd move for a cultural institution that celebrates diversity. If that's the case  you're barking up the wrong tree. Let's wait for an official statement.,0
We have no yet been able to see the video and it has not been posted on our You Tube channel  which makes it really hard to comment on. When we know what it is about we will comment.,0
We agree. This video conflicts strongly with Roskilde Festival’s values – and it was not meant to see the light of day. What you saw was a draft published by mistake in a third-party channel – this video has at no point been published in our own channels.,0
I hope you're right  Anders. So far I've rated Eyelight Videoproduktion on Facebook  and I hope everyone will do the same.,0
Thank you very much! Unfortunately  the cowards who made it have taken it down after people reacted negatively. Well  it's good that it's not there anymore  but it'll be hard for you to see it  if it doesn't exist anymore.,0
You can see it here: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152332666079306,0
Does that mean that the film WAS produced with RFs knowledge/involvement  but didn't live up to your standards? Because last night  representatives for RF gave the impression that you didn't have any knowledge of the film/the production company. It is all very confusing!,0
Sara Ferreira - fact is that we did agree with Eyelight on a promotion film. But we didn't see any materiale until the end result was in - and we couldn't in any way accept the content which is why we decided never to publish it. Then  by mistake  it was published in their channel - which started all this mess.  Yesterday was confusing  and not everyone was up-to-date with what was what. We are now.,0
Maybe you should consider an official statement. It is still being discussed widely on FB  and nobody knows what is up or down.,0
Sara Ferreira  we have considered it  but decided against it. It's weird to refer to something that isn't there.,0
But the *pirate-version* is still being circulated.,0
If people don't know what's up or down in the case  it's much more fitting that they catch up in the commentary track here. It would just add to the confusion to make a broad statement about something that hopefully will never see the light of day again because Roskilde didn't sanction it in the first place.

If the festival didn't see anything before this shitty draft/end result/call it what you want  that's not just unfortunate – it also exhibits extremely unprofessional behaviour by the company.,0
But did Roskilde Festival make an agreement with the company to make a promo video or not?,0
SO  it is not possible to get a confirmation that this was an official Roskilde-trailer??,0
Line Lee Sky Walker See my image above. I guess RF just hired Eyelight to do something  fresh and edgy  to go viral without the official logo on it. Plausible deniablility. But  RFs own words on the matter would of course be better than our guesses.,0
Zen Donen  fact is that we did agree with Eyelight on a promotion film. But we didn't see any material until the end result was in - and we couldn't in any way accept the content which is why we decided never to publish it. Then  by mistake  it was published in their channel - which started all this mess.,0
Thank you for your speedy reply. I do hope you will never use this company again and that you will put in your contract next time what your values are so that no one can be in doubt that you do NOT accept discrimination of homosexuals and objectification of women....,0
Zen Donen  we're definitely on the same page.,0
Thøger Juul Rivera-Thorsen  what did we do about this matter as far as you know?There are many myths going around.,0

I will look forward. I'll pray to the Gods i don't belive in for less rain and no flu  so i enjoy my 3rd visit.,0
A German Roskilde-goer just arrived in the mail. He will soon be placed in front of the LEGOlized Orange Stage  partying with all the other mini figures.  Send us YOUR mini figure and join the party.,19
who is playing ??,0
is it the naked run to the left?? :b,0
Sigurd  it surely is!,0
sure looks like it!,0
Mads is right  Volbeat is playing. It's a reproduction of Roskilde Festival 2011.,0
Roskilde Festival - what about the figures that were given during the festival?,0
Pascal they are already in front of the LEGOlized Orange Stage having fun. Many of them is in the pit line for Metallica,0
When D-A-D plays at the Orange stage I will sent my LEGOman!!!,0
If it's a reproduction of 2011 and they are watching Volbeat then how come some are standing in line for Metallica? What exactly did I miss out on that year?  ),0
Theis you're quick.. Well I guess it's what some would call artistic freedom  otherwise there's something we don't  know  ),0
Is it the L tower in the far left side? It seems to be a little closer to the canopy than I remember.. x),0
Jeppe it's indeed the L tower,0
Tusend tak! Please  give him some Lego-Øl and if he gets hungry a Lego-Oksekød and he will be the luckiest Lego-Boy in the World!,0

Am I the only one who can't find a 'ok'  'Submit'  'go' or-something-like-that - button? It just doesn't work for me! And I've got some great ideas :),0
We have chosen to close down some of the small first-aid stations we had in the towers (not all of them  though) and instead expand the central first-aid stations. The treatments that we typically have done in the towers have been the most simple. Everyone needing treatments that have required special attention has always been referred to the bigger first-aid stations. Financial circumstances and an increasing number of volunteers are the main factors behind this decision.,0
Only seen from afar...,0
Can I see it? We made a huge camp shaped as a pentagram. Would be a shame to have made all that for not a single air photo of it :s,0
You can't see any details - not your camp either - on the photo.,0

Trailer for the upcoming Roskilde - The Experience 3D movie.,0
This page is good to Roskilde Festival. Would be awesome if you updated it for 2012 and shared it on your page. #OrangeFeeling,0
http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/no-more-one-day-tickets-for-thursday/ Looks like Roskilde Festival will be soldout early this year. Tickets are selling fast We're selling tickets faster this year. Also all-week tickets are selling like hot cakes. The ticket sale has sped up – something we normally experience after announcing our full line-up.,0
That thursday is sold out is not surprising  since Rolling Stones are probably the biggest band in the world and it appeals to older people than the avarage RF goer  who have the money to make a quick buy and probably aren't interested in anything else on RF. There will probably also be a lot of people who buys a full ticket just to see Rolling Stones.,0
Would like to play this festival in 2013  anyone know how to contact the Artistic director? German Singer Guitarrist,0

Putting em on and off every year = fake! He's not a true fan but a true poser.,0
i can feel the smell,0
thats one of my missions! to do each global fest posible next year!!!,0
Lizanda Viviers  most of those are from Roskilde Festival  if not all :)   Personally I want at least 10. 2 up  8 to go.,0
so cool!!! w.,0
I have bought a full festival ticket  and since I couldent choose any entrance at this time  I assume I can choose an entrance later when the entrance booking opens? =) Really looking forward to RS´14 !! =) ,0
Yes. Entrance booking will be available later on,0
Why have Roskilde Festival changed it from +60 to +65 for free entrance on Sundays? Just wondering about the reasoning behind it.,0
Nothing yet  they are working on it still,0
How much is a ticket for sunday for a boy under 14? Is it cheaper to buy all week ticket? Roskilde Festival,0
He's good for a children's ticket (between 10 and 14 y.o.) which are sold at the entrance.,0
Yo! Do you show the world cup in football at the Festival area?,0
They did 4 years ago  so I think they will :) Probably just across the bridge from East to West,0
Can't promise anything.,0
come on... The world cup AND the orange feeling at the same time  it would be like heaven,0
Spotted this on Youtube and thought I'd share it. First of all: It's a great song - and secondly: There's something strangely familiar about the stage (for the impatient go to 9:45) :-)  ,0

Ohhhh   They don`t play Reggae in Denmark   ???  ,1
Soon. But we can't say when yet,0
How many Get A Place is still available?,0
Get A Place large is sold out and there are not many Get A Place mediums left. But we can't give specific numbers,0
One-day tickets for Thursday 3 July (when The Rolling Stones and Outkast will play) are sold out.  All-week tickets are still available: http://bit.ly/RF14ticket,88
I payed for two all-week tickets  but I didn't get them... hopefully they won't sell out before Billetnet gets to it  and sends me the mail with the tickets,0
So what happens when you've made your first payments to the flex tickets  but the week-tickets are sold out before you can make your last payment? (I ask this because in the Netherlands a lot of people bought a ticket for the entire Pinkpop festival just to see The Stones),0
Will you release more tickets for thursday  and if when?,0
Why do the two greatest names play on a thursday?,0
Thijs Kaagman  good question! If you've started your payment you're guaranteed a ticket. So no worries :-),0
Edvin Tønder  even if we do sell out  you're still guaranteed to get your tickets. Contact Billetnet about this matter  please.,0
I also bought my ticket about two weeks ago and I haven't received it yet. Will call Billetnet today..,0
Amanda  the only reason we're announcing the day The Rolling Stones are playing is because the band will announce the specific date. And in all fairness  we know that many people are also interested in seeing Outkast who's also playing Thursday - that's why we're mentioning those two acts.,0
Yeah I let them an email two days ago  haven't replied yet,0
No they are sold out for good,0
So if you buy a whole 8-day ticket  can't you go to the concert then?,0
Rasmus Hegelund  of course. A Full Festival Festival gives you access to all days - as always.,0
Rasmus Steenen Pedersen  two give Thursday a bad-ass reputation - AND because they were available on this particular day. We can't just pick choose (not always  anyways).,0
Will they play at the same time?,0
Lasse Basse Kristensen  nope  they're both playing on Orange Stage.,0
I was there every year between 1989 and 2000. After the accident I stayed away until my girlfriend convinced me to go back in 2005. Cried when I saw the memorial site....,0
We hope 2005 treated you well. And we hope to see you back some day again.,0
I go every 5 years now  so I'll be there in 2015. Faith in humankind has been restored! Can't wait!,0
1997. The morning after the worst weather in Denmark for decades. There was a row of 2 portaloos  directly in front of our camp about 10 meters away. The middle one was hit by lightning. Everyone in shock. Not much sleep that night....,0
Believe it or not  2007 was even worse than 1997. However  it's been fine ever since.  Has anyone found out a system for the downpours yet?,0
Used to be every 4 years or so. Next one is due....,0
That's Roskilde for ya!,0

One-days tickets for Thursday 3 July (the day The Rolling Stones and Outkast are playing) are ALMOST SOLD OUT.  If you want to visit Roskilde Festival just this one day  you have to act fast.  Tickets: http://bit.ly/RF14ticket,149

We can't say yet,0
Thursday afternoon? LOL  First band opens Orange Thursday at 18:00 as always. Some other stages sneak peak the opening by 15-30 minutes.  Remember though that the festival grounds open at 17:00.,0
Ready for the epic adventure? - Roskildefestival  Here is our journey through eight days of fun!  2013. worth checking out!    Looking forward to the next orange feeling.  ,0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84YDhZSjmk0 I can not wait for The Rolling Stones :),0
A trip down memory lane. In 1978 the iconic Orange Stage was raised in Roskilde for the very first time.   We got it from a bunch of guys called The Rolling Stones. What's your best memory from the Orange Stage?,52
Who are those guys THE ROLLING STONES... Do we know them...? :-),0
As far as I know the original Canopy Stage was used by Queen after Rolling Stones  so didn't you really get it from Queen?,0
Leningrad Cowboys With Red Army Quire year? Lightning struck and shut down part of the PA. Lightning balls flying over the tents between tele-poles in the camping area.,0
Black Sabbath & D-A-D,0
Who the fuck is The Rolling Stones..?? Some kind`a boyband or..?? 3:),0
Primus. As always I can't remember what year.,0
Johnny  it was created for The Rolling Stones' tour in 1976. Afterwards Queen and Peter Gabriel played one charity concert on the stage.,0
I know that it was created for the Rolling Stones. Everyone knows that. What most people don't know is that it was used after Rolling Stones finished their tour and before Roskilde bought it.,0
Some overly hyped boyband  I believe - they'll never make it!,0
ok... I´ll go and visit the show..Have seen them 6 times before... gourdeus band.....!!!!,0
Are you out of time...,0
Way out`a time - But i wont get no satisfaction  before those guys enter the stage :p,0
this was a unforgettable fire :-)),0
one of their last gigs!!! Crowd singing  Don't Look Back In Anger made me nearly crying....,0
Your reactions to today's The Rolling Stones announcement.,74
Bought my first ticket to Roskilde ever!,0
Personally I think it's great  considering a Rolling Stones gig on its own over here in the UK would be ridiculously expensive  booking them for a festival like Roskilde would justify the ticket price for the entire event on their own. I will be watching them  there's no doubt about that.,0
Will be back to Roskilde since 2001.This Will be great??,0
So fucking GOOD!!,0
Fantastic Roskilde  Rolling Stones is Orange feeling  -) I love it..,0
My reaction: bought a ticket :),0
I think i wil go there it's one of my favourites festival's,0
My sister was right about the Rolling Stones Will play??,0
Beast of burden  She's a Rainbow  Wild Horses ... 100's of good songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. LOVE-songs  Rock'n Roll  blues they have it all.,0
Old photo... why man? (get it),0
why did i every move away from denmark!!!!,0
<3 Roskilde Festival <3 nothing more to say really ! Great booking.,0
Fuck yearh! Fuck yearh! Hell fucking yearh!!! This is gonna be awesome!!!! Kan slet ikke vente!!! :-D:-D,0
Great! They are back on the Orange stage! they never playd roskilde  but the orange stage  the orginal one  was owned/used by Rolling Stones before sold to the festival. Thats cool!,0
you could have booked at least 10 supercool band with the same money...and most likely the gig will be cancelled. NorthSide Festival and Copenhell has better line up then you...,0
Torben Nielebock Christiansen  perfect timing for a recording :-),0
Jesper Lanther  they may not be the youngest band  but they still deliver the goods!,0
You asked for my reactions Roskilde Festival  and You got it....,0
Jesper Lanther  touché! :-D,0
Rolling Stones are legends and rock n roll have no age :),0
http://youtu.be/g9YEAwHdaeY,0
Is it possible to order cancellation insurance along with your ticket? I am wondering because I did not see the option when I ordered my ticket.,0
Modtaget - I do understand english  and I'm Aware that 65 is the limit now for free entrance on Sunday. :),0
You may have heard the rumour about The Rolling Stones - today we confirmed it.  Early this morning we called a few fans to get their reactions.  Are you as excited as them?,62
you said to everyone that they were the first???..... Wait i hope they dont mind this though,0
I'm still waiting for my call about U2 :P,0
Well. We told them beforehand that we would talk to a few people. But they were the first four. We don't think they mind,0
You're right. But it was a matter of a few minutes between them. We told them we would talk to a few people and we don't think they mind,0
U2 - Gaaaaaaaaab :o,0
Morten Hvass Jensen  this is an open channel - and we have audiences from all over the world. Why wouldn't we communicate in an international language?,0
Morten Hvass Jensen  we don't think it's uncool to speak Danish. But we think it's very uncool to write in Danish when we also have visitors from Germany  England  Finland and other countries. They may not represent 80 % of the festival-goers but we want to communicate so that everyone understands.,0
Baby! Can you consider this uprising and great Icelandic band for next years Pavillion? It'd be the greatest of all that is cool and sexy :)  ,0
Do we get any more clues before the line-up release next week?,0
Maybe. Just maybe. :-),0
Black Stone Cherry for a party friday night. Come on Roskilde....,0
or any other day!,0
Stevie Wonder is going to Norway to play at a small jazz festival on the 5 of July... the only proper thing is to book him for Roskilde. If you havent i will cry. ,0
Are you referring to any specific tickets or add-ons that are sold-out?,0
Get a place large Roskilde Festival :(,0
Christoffer - These sold out quicker than expected. Unfortunately they are sold out for good. There are not many Get A Place mediums left now either,0
Then I'm happy I got a few of the medium ones instead. See you in a couple of months,0
It's working again!,0
The Rolling Stones are playing thursday. Also this year you have to be 65+ to get in for free on Sunday,0
Here's an idea - 60 teasers for next wednesday! Up for it?,0

Without notice even :) And as I said below  you can't even comment on news section anymore.  #rf14 #lame,0
We had to deactivate it for a while to keep the site floating. Sorry. It'll be back.,0
Ah  it's just to take the brunt of the server load off until the storm about the Stones wears off? Thanks for the swift reply.,0
Never would have happened if you had a proper working forum that wasn't embedded in the website .,0
We all have itchy fingers (or  should I say  Sticky Fingers?)  but hopefully it'll be up and running soon enough :D,0
Very funny Roskilde Festival. You announce Rolling Stones and on your news sections invite people to comment. You just have to log in to do so. However  since you also removed the forum and I pressume all user profiles associated with it  and removed the facebook log in option (which never actually worked) there's no way to log in.  Extremely good way to make sure no one ever criticize you.,0
We have temporarily disabled the forum to (hopefully) make sure the website wouldn't crash. It will be up and running again soon.,0
Never would have happened if you had a proper working forum that wasn't embedded in the website .,0

Now That! Is the way to open The Roskilde Festival!!! Happy Thursday  y'all!!! :-),0
Then I will be sitting some what comfortably in my camp drinking Tuborg and Fernet Branca. Unlike Rolling Stones.. they never get old.,0
Well  let's give it time. Jagger needs to grieve and Europe has waited for 7 years - we can wait a little longer if that's the case. Hang in there  Mick!,0
B O R I  N G ! !  ! ! ! !,0
Huge waste of money if you ask me  but it looks like it pleases some people  so I'm happy for those! :),0
The Rolling Stones and Outkast Official both on Thursday? Best day ever!,0
Yeahhh...finaly a real legendary band....,0
Thomas Edison So heaven is a place on earth after all. ,0
Ehh  so the major mainstream act for sunday is still to be announced. ......,0
Johan Boserup that's one for the books!,0
Oh my god!,0
YOU ROCK! No wait  THEY ROCK!,0
Roskilde I love you!,0
Just bought my tickets! We'll be on our way from Perth  Australia for the second time. Thanks Roskilde Festival :),0
Well that's half the budget gone :) pleased about it though,0
To much money if they cancel,0
The orange stage was made for them :). Literally!,0
At five million it's a scoop - at 10-12 million it's simply too damaging to the rest of the program. And taken into consideration  that the rest of the line up is shallow at it's best  chances are that too much of the budget has been allocated to Rolling Stones ...,0
Yay - tickets purchased and my monday just went from good to great!,0
Tickets arrived :D!!!,0
WHAT I HAVE TO GO,0
Se her Maiken Hvidkjær Jensen :D,0
WooooHooooooooo :D,0

F A N T A S T I C !!!!!! Just a perfect present for my 25-years Roskilde anniversary!! Thanks Roskilde Festival,0
I know its only rockn roll but I like it  ),0
Wow I did not know that already  ),0
wicked !! :D,0
Mads: I know that  but the stage itself was designed for them  no matter how many updated versions there have been since then,0
Inés de Babilonia Juan Cabrera Sijia Wang see u at the studenthouse on wednesday to talk about that!!  ),0
Oh my GOD!!!!,0
Spending half the music money on a bunch of  very old billionars? Where are the visions?,0
And the one's who's always bitching about  where's the BIG bands??   just got very quiet. It's probably the same people who says that this booking costs too much.,0
I think you misspelled Rage Against The Machine.,0
It's awesome!! (y) but it means no Rage against the machine :(,0
This is so COOL :D !!!,0
Camilla Rifbjerg Næsager Caroline A Christensen Christina Agertoft Jensen Cecilie Lund Larsen Julie Lund Larsen Michelle Munch Hansen,0
If people are able to behave in a better way than they did when Springsteen played (I had to leave because of all the talking) it just may be fun - if not some interesting new act is probably playing at another stage....,0
WHAT,0
Mat Foster Andrew Foster no fucking way,0
I have a question - on the Thursday  I see that the music area only opens at 17:00. Does that mean that there is no music before 17:00?,0
Wow!!!:D,0
Rage Against the Machine,0
Hi Roskilde Festival! Just bough my ticket out of pure excitement. I presume that both Outkast an The Rolling Stones will play at the Orange Stage. However  Thursday is usually the short music day  so how is this going down? Are you going to expand the usual Thursday music hours in order to accommodate this or is one of these huge artists playing on Arena or real early on the Orange Stage?,0
When do we know the time of the stones concert? Need to know if I have to get thursday or friday off at work :),0
Rolling Stones? Wtf? :-D Zakarias Wenzel,0
In a way it IS quite fitting  as the original canopy stage was first used by The Stones -),0
is there any possibility outkast and stones will be playing at the same time? would be the worst!,0
Nóra S Tóth !!:O,0
So fucking Nice .....,0
Aaaaarrrggghhh FUCK MY LIFE...!!,0
Jonatan Elnegaard - what you saaaay ? :),0
100 days.. start me up :P,0
Let´s go back to the caves era. It´s only R&R but who doesn´t like it?,0
@Jacob: probably not. If they're both headliners they'll both play on orange. :),0
Going to germany to see them. xxx,0
ROLLING STONES.......det bli'r FEEEEEEDT.....It's only Rock'n Roll.....but I like it.....!!!!! :-),0
Aaaaaaand they're gone,0
Damn you all! I want to go,0
#orangefeeling #*RF14 yeah! Now I can see them live for the 4th time!,0
You should book our beloved Rebecca! <3,0
So excited!! Do you know what day Merchandise are playing?,0
What time will the rolling stones play?,0
What happened to the forum on the website? It's gone...,0
We had to deactivate it for a while to keep the site floating. Sorry. It'll be back,0
You can apply for general volunteer work at Roskilde 2014 very soon. Keep an eye on our page.,0
You can see our camping offers here: http://roskilde-festival.dk/news/singlenews/sleep-100-metres-from-the-orange-stage/,0
We're getting closer...,32
Great stuff to come  I'm sure. :-),0
Please become a mainly Rockfestival again... :-),0
The lineup so far is not impressive  but I'm optimistic. Please improve!!!,0
10 days to go where sorry Oo ?!,0
How many more acts do you have to announce? Looking forward to seeing what you have lined up!,0
Can't wait Patrick Christensen,0
Simon well here we go,0
I hope it s The Rolling Stones :),0
M.i.a. Please!,0
Old Jamaican reggae stars and some punk/hc/postpunk/etc thanks! Max Romeo  Toots and The Maytals  AFI  Against Me!  INVSN...,0
The line up so far is awesome  maybe not for the one that doesnt reach out for unknown bands. Hope for a lot of groups  but mainly Future Islands.,0
So Roughly 50 names on the poster day and 20 afterwards  there has to be alot of gems waiting for us.,0
What time is it?,0
rage against the machine!,0
What about linning up Skinny Puppy - on tour  new album and their history!?!?,0
Leonard Cohen would be awesome.,0
Your Wierd focus on rap and electronic is the problem :),0
Im trying im trying  But its just Wierd that all the big names untill now are pop  rap  and electronic. Try and take a look at the line ups at the other festivals in Europe. Diversity is good and I love it  But the main focus this year is just off,0
Are you skipping announcements this wednesday like you did last wednesday?,0
Peter Keeling Emil Emil Oscar Gehin we need to buy before this 10 days is up!!!,0
I seriously hope the rumors about rolling stones is not true it will eat to much of the booking money and program will suffer from it,0
rolling stones ac/dc  eels and death please :-) and on the top  some ska music..,0
Is there a possibility that we will see Foster the people this year? :),0
I hope to see the following band on the final band list: Riverside  Transatlantic  Joe Bonamassa  Alterbridge  Jake E Lee Dragon Cartel  Lee Abraham and then I will be happy :),0
Can you get Tyler the creator or Death Grips or *dream* Stevie wonder? :D,0
Roskilde  can you help me find  Ali Baba Camp  please? Great camp  great people  lost everyone :(,0
We will get some more acts before april 2 ? and will be big news ?,0
Let's see what happens.,0
What time on April 2 will the poster release take place? Noon or night?,0
I hoping for The Rolling Stones :),0
Hello Roskilde Festival! I did just by my ticket to this years festival (16th time) and i was a little bit annoyed by the fact that when i was going to pay for my ticket they charged me an extra 56 34ddk for useing a VISA not issued in Denmark. For me itäs not a matter of the amount itself but i find it quit ridicoulous to charge that extra fee for people coming to visit the festival from abroad. I do belive this should be adressed when signing your deals with Billetnet/Ticketmaster. Other than that looking forward to see you in 100days.,0
Hi Jocke. We've looked into the matter  and the card fees are not decided by Ticketmaster. Whoever issued the card decides the fee  we're afraid.  You can read more here: http://www.billetnet.dk/help/gebyrer.html?language=en-us&l=DK&tm_link=tm_header_lang4,0
Ok thanks for the answer,0
it is standard in Denmark when using a foreign card (not issued in Denmark) there is a 3.25% fee which goes to the payment provider. So if you wan't to vent your frustration you should should adress it to Nets or VISA,0
BOOK THESE GUYS!!,0
You can actually catch them already in mid May: http://www.poprevo.dk/artists,0
We may just do that again  yes.,0
...Do it with energy drinks too... That would be so cool! And thanks for answering!,0
Hey! When is the big announcement day  where you announce about 50 acts?? Really looking forward to that day...,0
100 days until the campsite opens and Roskilde Festival 2014 kicks off!  Have you started preparing yet - and if so  how?  Photo: Philip Overbuary,147
You start preparing the day the festival ends! But it'd be nice to know about entrance booking soon???? Y'know  since it's a pretty big part of planning.,0
I just bought an anti-gypsie kit to get rid of the fuckers.,0
I have started preparing to be horribly depressed because I won't be there this year!,0
Are you going to announce any new names on this glorious day?,0
What's the point in preparing? Last year I came prepared with a tent  clothes and proper footwear. 2 hours into the festival  I wasn't wearing my own clothes  I never slept in my own tent and its not much I remember from saturday to thursday evening when the music started. The big smile on my face on every picture from the warm up suggest I had an amazing time though,0
Oliver Hilbo :D,0
Trying to make the boys start planning but they are crazy lazy,0
Charlotte Lindegaard Mathiesen Kamille Larsen Ida Rebekka Jensen Celina Simone Wolff Sara M. Lorenzen OMGGG PIGER ????????,0

Julie Mortensen Hakonsen  we know. We'll be ready before long.,0
I think that they will wait until 2. april  to announce more names :-),0
I also think so  but you can always hope :),0
You little piece of shit,0
It's you sitting on your lazy fat ass  sayin' u almost won't pay nuthin' for a soundtruck,0

Help us fill the audience area in front of our LEGO Orange Stage by donating LEGO minifigures - the area is almost empty at the moment.   Donate your LEGO minifigures by mail – or you're much welcome to drop by and deliver them at Roskilde Festival. Our address is: Roskilde Festival  Havsteensvej 11  4000 Roskilde. Denmark.   http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/news/singlenews/wanted-lego-audience-for-orange-stage/,27
Nezar Fez Nielsen  it's more fun if it's 100 % audience-made.,0
Patrick Frørup here at Roskilde Festival we love to play with LEGO  ),0
Fits the season doesnt it? :-),0
What happened to the old ones?,0
Pair Karlsson  they were only on loan.,0
Who did you give it back to?,0
Probably a 5 year old...,0
Thomas Kilde Jakobsen  the guy who built it needed the LEGO figures for a new project.,0
A minifugure from Bulgaria was sent. It's a girl:),0
Hmm  Just bought app. 50 for my own collection. Maybe i can find an xtra to send  -) Would be appriciated with updating images  and in bigger scales :-),0
ask LEGO? ATM you are just giving them free advertisement...,0
Well  it depends upon who's playing on stage. My lego figures won't settle for any lame bands.,0
Casper Vildbech: Again  it's more fun if it's 100% audience made  and thus we will be able to tell the story to all our guests through the year of how our insanely wonderfull festival participants made this LEGO madness  istead of just saying:  That? Oh well  some dudes from LEGO gave it to us  and we decided to put it here in the hall because it is pretty  :-),0
Brian Lynch: Well  then it depends on if you like Volbeat,0
Johannes  they actually played at Roskilde before they got big. That's part of what we do  you know.,0
Lars Clausen  What do you want your minifigures to do? Please explain? We will try to meet requests if they are within reason.,0
Bård-Remi Starheim  if only!,0
Know what the best part of this poster is? (and no  it's not the mushroom  even though that is kind of funny xD) It was only 40 kr. for 3 days of happiness!!!!! :O  - counting every day 'till '13,0
Except that it was only three days back then :-) Beautiful poster though.,0
Yes  you will. The winner will be contacted very soon.,0
The Rolling Stones have a concert at the Stade de France in Paris added to the European tour of the band. After the death of the girlfriend of Mick Jagger  the band canceled all concerts in Australia and New Zealand. The European leg of their tour  14 on fire  will proceed as planned  it sounds. From ,0
The name is Lazerus.,0
Rasmus Seebach....which does not make him relevant for Roskilde Festival imo. I do however believe that Disneyland After Dark will be announced with the poster. There's simply too many things pointing in that direction in my mind :),0
Hey Roskilde! :) I'm going to work for [GOU] på Roskilde Festival at the festival for the first time and am wondering whether it is possible to stay at the caravan camping site? Hope to hear from you soon. Nele,0
Everyone can stay at the caravan site - but everyone needs to buy an add-on ticket in order to do so. More info: http://roskilde-festival.dk/camping/caravan/,0

Hey guys. I have a random question. What was the point of getting rid of those 2 lighting towers if you still can't see from behind them anyway because you still have the ground part? Why don't you come up with some way of having the sound & lighting crews somewhere that doesn't obstruct view too? Having a view of the orange stage from anywhere would be BRILLIANT  during really popular bands  it's such a push and shove to get in the middle area.,0
Take this picture as an example (it's from 1998): https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150398089296706&set=a.99196301705.99302.10248811705&type=3&theater  This sound tower went about 15 meters up in the air  blocking the view for everyone in the middle of the audience area. What we have now is so much better. It can probably still be improved  but at least most people can see now.,0
And we have a winner!   Daniel Lama is this week's lucky winner of our brand-new board game CAMP ROSKILDE.  Be sure to enter our music quiz - The Sound of Roskilde - for your chance to win the board game: http://roskilde-festival.dk/uk/the-sound-of-roskilde,3
Tanya Voetmann Sørensen It's easy peasy. We'd love to invite you to a game if you think that would help :),0
Daniel Lama We have sent you an e-mail  please reply asap  so we can mail you the awesome board game :),0
Daniel Lama Ok we got it - thanks!,0
